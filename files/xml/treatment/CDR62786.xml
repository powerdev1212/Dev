cancer are usually referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team
of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during
childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following health care professionals

pediatric patients with cancer have been outlined by the American Academy of

most patients and families.  Clinical trials for children and adolescents with
cancer are generally designed to compare potentially better therapy with
therapy that is currently accepted as standard.  Most of the progress
made in identifying curative therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved
through clinical trials.  Information about ongoing clinical trials is

This represented the first step in harmonizing disease staging and risk stratification worldwide.  The INSS is a postoperative staging system that was developed in 1988 and used the extent of surgical resection to stage patients.  This led to some variability in stage assignments in different countries because of regional differences in surgical strategy and, potentially, because of limitations in access to experienced pediatric surgeons.  As a result of further advances in the understanding of neuroblastoma biology and genetics, a risk classification system was developed that incorporates clinical and biological factors in addition to INSS stage to facilitate risk group and treatment assignment for COG studies.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Table id="_725"><Title>Table 3.

The extent of disease is determined by the presence or absence of image-defined risk factors (IDRFs) and/or metastatic tumor at the time of diagnosis, before any treatment or surgery. IDRFs are surgical risk factors, detected by imaging, which could potentially make total tumor excision risky or difficult at the time of diagnosis and increase the risk of surgical complications.  </Para><Para id="_894">The INRGSS simplifies stages into L1, L2, M or MS (refer to <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062786#_780" url="/types/neuroblastoma/hp/neuroblastoma-treatment-pdq">Table 4</SummaryRef> and the list of <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062786#_1019" url="/types/neuroblastoma/hp/neuroblastoma-treatment-pdq">IDRFs</SummaryRef> for more information).  Localized tumors are classified as stage L1 or L2 disease on the basis of whether one or more of the 20 IDRFs are present.<Reference refidx="23"/> For example, in the  case of spinal cord compression, an IDRF is present when more than one-third of the spinal canal in the axial plane is invaded, when the leptomeningeal spaces are not visible, or when the spinal cord magnetic resonance signal intensity is abnormal.  By combining the INRGSS, preoperative imaging and biological factors, each patient has a <Emphasis>risk stage</Emphasis> defined that predicts outcome and dictates the appropriate treatment approach to be followed.  The INRGSS has predictive value for lower stage patients, with stage L1 having a 5-year EFS of 90%, compared with 78% for L2.<Reference refidx="23"/> </Para><Para id="_895">Most international protocols have begun to incorporate collection and use of IDRF in risk stratification and assignment of therapy.<Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/> The COG has been collecting and evaluating INRGSS  data since 2006. A COG trial that opened in 2014 uses the INRGSS to determine therapy for patients with certain localized disease and stage 4S patients. Note that the INSS allows patients up to age 12 months  in stage 4S, while the INRGSS allows patients up to age 18 months in stage MS. It is anticipated that the use of standardized nomenclature will contribute substantially to more uniform staging and thereby facilitate comparisons of clinical trials conducted in different parts of the world.</Para><Table id="_780"><Title>Table 4.

Previously, most children with neuroblastoma in North America were treated according to the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) risk-group assignment, even if they were not enrolled in a COG study. In the most recent COG study, the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) system was used to assign treatment. Because the older system is still being used by some physicians to assign treatments, the treatments described in this summary are based on both the INRG system and the most recently published COG risk stratification system. In the INRG system, each child is assigned to a group on the basis of image-defined potential surgical risk, age, and the presence or absence of metastasis. (Refer to the list of <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062786#_1019" url="/types/neuroblastoma/hp/neuroblastoma-treatment-pdq">image-defined risk factors</SummaryRef> for more information.)

If the pattern of metastases in such a patient is consistent with a 4S pattern of disease (skin, liver, bone marrow less than 10% involved), these patients are not classified as progressive/metastatic disease, which would typically be a criteria for removal from protocol therapy.
