The disease is characterized by the accumulation of lymphoblasts in the marrow or in various extramedullary sites, frequently accompanied by suppression of normal hematopoiesis.  B- and T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cells express surface antigens that parallel their respective lineage developments.  Precursor B-cell ALL cells typically express CD10, CD19, and CD34 on their surface along, with nuclear terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT), while precursor T-cell ALL cells commonly express CD2, CD3, CD7, CD34, and TdT.</Para><MediaLink ref="CDR0000526538" type="image/jpeg" alt="Blood cell development; drawing shows the steps a blood stem cell goes through to become a red blood cell, platelet, or white blood cell.

leukemia may have a cytogenetic abnormality that is cytogenetically
indistinguishable from the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1).<Reference refidx="3"/> The Ph1 occurs in only 1% to 2% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but it occurs in about 20% of
adults and a small percentage of children with ALL.<Reference refidx="4"/> In the majority of
children and in more than one-half of adults with Ph1-positive
ALL, the molecular abnormality is different from that in Ph1-positive chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML).
</Para><Para id="_22">  Many patients who
have molecular evidence of the <GeneName>bcr-abl</GeneName> fusion gene, which characterizes the Ph1, have no evidence of the abnormal chromosome by cytogenetics.  
   The <GeneName>bcr-abl</GeneName> fusion gene may be detectable only by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) because many patients have a different fusion protein from the one found in
CML (p190 vs. p210).  These tests should be performed, whenever
possible, in patients with ALL, especially in  those with B-cell lineage disease.</Para><Para id="_23">L3 ALL is associated with a variety of translocations that
involve translocation of the <GeneName>c-myc</GeneName>  proto-oncogene to the immunoglobulin gene
locus t(2;8), t(8;12), and t(8;22).</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_26"><Title>Diagnosis</Title><Para id="_215">Patients with ALL may present with a variety of hematologic derangements ranging from pancytopenia to hyperleukocytosis.  In addition to a history and physical, the initial workup should include: </Para><ItemizedList id="_216" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Complete blood count with differential.</ListItem><ListItem>A chemistry panel (including uric acid, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, potassium, phosphate, calcium, bilirubin, and hepatic transaminases).</ListItem><ListItem>Fibrinogen and tests of coagulation as a screen for disseminated intravascular coagulation.</ListItem><ListItem>A careful screen for evidence of active infection.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_217">A bone marrow biopsy and aspirate are routinely performed even in T-cell ALL to determine the extent of marrow involvement.  Malignant cells should be sent for conventional cytogenetic studies, as detection of the Ph1 t(9;22), <GeneName>myc</GeneName> gene rearrangements (in Burkitt leukemia), and <GeneName>MLL</GeneName> gene rearrangements add important prognostic information. Flow cytometry should be performed to characterize expression of lineage-defining antigens and allow determination of the specific ALL subtype.  In addition, for B-cell disease, the malignant cells should be analyzed using RT-PCR and FISH for evidence of the <GeneName>bcr-abl</GeneName> fusion gene.  This last point is of utmost importance, as timely diagnosis of Ph1 ALL will significantly change the therapeutic approach.</Para><Para id="_32">Diagnostic
confusion with  AML, hairy cell leukemia, and
malignant lymphoma is not uncommon.  Proper diagnosis is crucial because of the
difference in prognosis and treatment of ALL and AML.  Immunophenotypic
analysis is essential because leukemias that do not express myeloperoxidase
include M0 AML,  M7 AML,  and ALL.
</Para><Para id="_33">The examination of bone marrow
aspirates and/or biopsy specimens should be done by an experienced oncologist,
hematologist, hematopathologist, or general pathologist who is capable of
interpreting conventional and specially stained specimens.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_34"><Title>Prognosis and Survival</Title><Para id="_155">Factors associated with prognosis in patients with ALL include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_156" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem><Strong>Age:</Strong> Age, which is a significant factor in
childhood ALL and  AML, may  be an important prognostic factor in adult
ALL.  In one study, overall, the prognosis was better in patients younger than
25 years; another study found a better prognosis in  patients younger than 35
years.  These findings may, in part, be related to the increased incidence of
the  Ph1 in older ALL patients, a subgroup associated
with poor prognosis.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/> </ListItem><ListItem><Strong>CNS involvement:</Strong> As in childhood ALL, adult patients with ALL are at risk of developing CNS involvement during the course of their disease. This is particularly true for patients with L3  (Burkitt) morphology.<Reference refidx="7"/> Both treatment and
prognosis are influenced by this complication. </ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Cellular morphology:</Strong> Patients with L3 morphology showed improved outcomes, as evidenced in a completed Cancer and Leukemia Group B study (<ProtocolRef href="CDR0000077643" nct_id="NCT00002494">CLB-9251</ProtocolRef> [NCT00002494]), when treated according to
specific treatment algorithms.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/>  This study found  that L3 leukemia can be cured with aggressive, rapidly cycling lymphoma-like
chemotherapy regimens.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Chromosomal abnormalities:</Strong> Chromosomal
abnormalities, including aneuploidy and translocations, have been described and
may correlate with prognosis.<Reference refidx="12"/> In particular, patients with Ph1-positive t(9;22) ALL have a
poor prognosis and represent more than 30% of adult cases. <GeneName>Bcr-abl</GeneName>-rearranged leukemias that do not
demonstrate the classical Ph1 carry a poor prognosis that is similar
to those that are Ph1-positive.  Patients with Ph1-positive ALL are rarely cured with chemotherapy, although long-term survival is now being routinely reported when such patients are treated with combinations of chemotherapy and <GeneName>Bcr-abl</GeneName> tyrosine kinase inhibitors. <Para id="_41">Two other chromosomal abnormalities with poor prognosis are t(4;11), which is characterized by rearrangements of the <GeneName>MLL</GeneName> gene and may be rearranged despite normal cytogenetics, and t(9;22). In addition to t(4;11) and t(9;22), compared with patients with a normal karyotype, patients
with deletion of chromosome 7 or trisomy 8 have been reported to have a lower
probability of survival at 5 years.<Reference refidx="13"/> In a multivariate analysis, karyotype was the most important
predictor of disease-free survival.<Reference refidx="13"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335148">Level of evidence: 3iiDii</LOERef>]</Para></ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_42"><Title> Late Effects of Treatment for Adult ALL</Title><Para id="_43">Long-term follow-up of 30 patients with ALL in remission for at least 10 years has demonstrated ten cases of secondary malignancies.  Of 31 long-term female survivors of ALL or AML younger than 40 years, 26 resumed normal menstruation following completion of therapy.      Among 36 live offspring of survivors, two congenital problems occurred.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_243"><Title>Related Summaries</Title><Para id="_244">Other PDQ summaries containing information related to acute lymphoblastic leukemia  include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_245" Style="bullet">
