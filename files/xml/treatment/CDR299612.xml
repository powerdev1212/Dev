A total of 220,800 new cases of prostate cancer and 27,540 deaths from the disease are anticipated in the United States in 2015, making it the most frequent nondermatologic cancer among U.S. males.<Reference refidx="1"/>  A man’s lifetime risk of prostate cancer is one in seven. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men, exceeded only by lung cancer.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_3">Some men with prostate cancer remain asymptomatic and die from unrelated causes rather than as a result of the cancer itself. This may be due to the advanced age of many men at the time of diagnosis, slow tumor growth, or response to therapy.<Reference refidx="2"/>  The estimated number of men with latent prostate carcinoma (i.e., prostate cancer that is present in the prostate gland but never detected or diagnosed during a patient’s life) is greater than the number of men with clinically detected disease.  A better understanding is needed of the genetic and biologic mechanisms that determine why some prostate carcinomas remain clinically silent, while others cause serious, even life-threatening illness.<Reference refidx="2"/> </Para><Para id="_350">Prostate cancer exhibits tremendous differences in incidence among populations worldwide; the ratio of countries with high and low rates of prostate cancer ranges from 60-fold to 100-fold.<Reference refidx="3"/> Asian men typically have a very low incidence of prostate cancer, with age-adjusted incidence rates ranging from 2 to 10 cases per 100,000 men.  Higher incidence rates are generally observed in northern European countries.  African American men, however, have the highest incidence of prostate cancer in the world; within the United States, African American men have a 60% higher incidence rate than white  men.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_4">These differences may be due to the interplay of genetic, environmental, and social influences (such as access to health care), which may affect the development and progression of the disease.<Reference refidx="5"/> Differences in screening practices have also had a substantial influence on prostate cancer incidence, by permitting prostate cancer to be diagnosed in some patients before symptoms develop or before abnormalities on physical examination are detectable.  An analysis of population-based data from Sweden suggested that a diagnosis of prostate cancer in one brother leads to an early diagnosis in a second brother using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening.<Reference refidx="6"/> This may account for an increase in prostate cancer diagnosed in younger men that was evident in nationwide incidence data. A genetic contribution to prostate cancer risk has been documented, but knowledge of the molecular genetics of prostate cancer is still limited.  Malignant transformation of prostate epithelial cells and progression of prostate carcinoma are likely to  result from a complex series of initiation and promotional events under both genetic and environmental influences.<Reference refidx="7"/> </Para><SummarySection id="_5"><Title>Risk Factors for Prostate Cancer</Title><Para id="_6">The three most important recognized risk factors for prostate cancer in the United States are:</Para><ItemizedList id="_7" Style="bullet"><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000299612#_1176" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq">Age</SummaryRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000299612#_1178" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq">Race</SummaryRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000299612#_13" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq">Family history of prostate cancer</SummaryRef>.</ListItem></ItemizedList><SummarySection id="_1176"><Title>Age</Title><Para id="_1177">Age is an important risk factor for prostate cancer.  Prostate cancer is rarely seen in men younger than 40 years; the incidence rises rapidly with each decade thereafter.  For example, the probability of being diagnosed with prostate cancer is 1 in 304 for men 49 years or younger, 1 in 44 for men aged 50 through 59 years, 1 in 16 for men aged 60 through 69 years, and 1 in 9 for men aged 70 years and older, with an overall lifetime risk of developing prostate cancer of 1 in 7.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1178"><Title>Race</Title><Para id="_32">The risk of developing and dying from prostate cancer is dramatically higher among blacks, is of
intermediate levels among whites, and is lowest among native Japanese.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/>   Conflicting data have been published regarding

Results from several large case-control studies and cohort studies representing various populations suggest that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000302456">family history</GlossaryTermRef> is a major risk factor in prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/>  A family history of a brother or father with prostate cancer increases the risk of prostate cancer, and the risk is inversely related to the age of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460124">affected</GlossaryTermRef> relative.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/>   However, at least some familial aggregation is due to increased prostate cancer screening in families thought to be at high risk.<Reference refidx="18"/></Para><Para id="_15">Although many of the prostate cancer studies examining risks associated with family history have used hospital-based series,  several studies described population-based series.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/>  The latter are thought to provide information that is more generalizable.  A meta-analysis of 33 epidemiologic case-control and cohort-based studies has provided more detailed information regarding risk ratios related to family history of prostate cancer. Risk appeared to be greater for men with affected brothers than for men with affected fathers in this meta-analysis. Although the reason for this difference in risk is unknown, possible hypotheses have  included <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339348">X-linked</GlossaryTermRef> or recessive inheritance. In addition, risk increased with increasing numbers of affected close relatives. Risk also increased when a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460150">first-degree relative</GlossaryTermRef> (FDR) was diagnosed with prostate cancer before age 65 years.

These data were derived from a resource that contained more than 11.8 million individuals, among whom there were 26,651 men with medically verified prostate cancer, of which 5,623 were familial cases.<Reference refidx="23"/> The size of this data set, with its nearly complete ascertainment of the entire Swedish population and objective verification of cancer diagnoses, should yield risk estimates that are both accurate and free of bias. When the familial age-specific hazard ratios (HRs)  for prostate cancer diagnosis and mortality were computed, as expected, the HR for prostate cancer diagnosis increased with more family history.  Specifically, HRs for prostate cancer were 2.12 (95% CI, 2.05–2.20) with an affected father only, 2.96 (95% CI, 2.80–3.13) with an affected brother only, and 8.51 (95% CI, 6.13–11.80) with a father and two brothers affected. The highest HR,  17.74 (95% CI, 12.26–25.67), was seen in men with three brothers diagnosed with prostate cancer. The HRs were even higher when the affected relative was diagnosed with prostate cancer before age 55 years. </Para><Para id="_1203">A separate analysis of this Swedish database reported that the cumulative (absolute) risks of prostate cancer among men in families with two or more affected cases were 5% by age 60 years, 15% by age 70 years, and 30% by age 80 years,  compared with 0.45%, 3%, and 10%, respectively,  by  the same ages in the general population. The risks were even higher when the affected father was diagnosed before age 70 years.<Reference refidx="24"/> The corresponding familial population attributable fractions (PAFs) were 8.9%, 1.8%, and 1.0% for the same three age groups, respectively, yielding a total PAF of 11.6% (i.e.,  approximately 11.6% 
of all prostate cancers in Sweden can be accounted for on the basis of familial history of the disease).
</Para><Para id="_117">The risk of prostate cancer may also increase in men who have a family history of breast cancer.  Approximately 9.6% of the Iowa cohort had a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer in a mother or sister at baseline, and this was positively associated with prostate cancer risk (age-adjusted RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0–3.0; multivariate RR, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.9–3.2).  Men with a family history of both prostate and breast/ovarian cancer were also at increased risk of prostate cancer (RR, 5.8; 95% CI, 2.4–14.0).<Reference refidx="19"/> Other studies, however, did not find an association between family history of female breast cancer and risk of prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="25"/> A family history of prostate cancer also increases the risk of breast cancer among female relatives.<Reference refidx="26"/> The association between prostate cancer and breast cancer in the same family may be explained, in part, by the increased risk of prostate cancer among men with <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046063">mutations</GlossaryTermRef> in the setting of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer or early-onset prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/> (Refer to the <GeneName><SummaryRef href="CDR0000299612#_1051" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq">BRCA1 and BRCA2</SummaryRef></GeneName>  section of this summary for more information.)</Para><Para id="_16">Family history has been shown to be a risk factor for men of different races and ethnicities.  In a population-based case-control study of prostate cancer among African Americans, whites, and Asian Americans in the United States  (Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Hawaii) and Canada (Vancouver and Toronto),<Reference refidx="31"/>   5% of controls and 13% of all cases reported a father, brother, or son with prostate cancer.  These prevalence estimates were somewhat lower among Asian Americans than among African Americans or whites.  A positive family history was associated with a twofold to threefold increase in RR in each of the three ethnic groups.  The overall odds ratio associated with a family history of prostate cancer was 2.5 (95% CI, 1.9–3.3) with adjustment for age and ethnicity.<Reference refidx="31"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1179"><Title>Other potential modifiers of prostate cancer risk</Title><Para id="_10">Endogenous hormones, including both androgens and estrogens, likely influence prostate carcinogenesis.  It has been widely reported that eunuchs and other individuals with castrate levels of testosterone prior to puberty do not develop prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="32"/> Some investigators have considered the potential role of genetic variation in androgen biosynthesis and metabolism in prostate cancer risk,<Reference refidx="33"/> including the potential role of the <GeneName>androgen receptor</GeneName> (<GeneName>AR</GeneName>) CAG repeat length in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460146">exon</GlossaryTermRef> 1.

There is little evidence that alcohol consumption is associated with the risk of developing prostate cancer; however,  data  suggest that smoking  increases the risk of fatal prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="41"/>  Several studies have suggested that vasectomy  increases the risk of prostate cancer,<Reference refidx="42"/> but other studies have not confirmed this observation.<Reference refidx="43"/> Obesity has also been associated with increased risk of advanced stage at diagnosis, prostate cancer metastases, and prostate cancer–specific death.<Reference refidx="44"/><Reference refidx="45"/></Para><Para id="_756">Other nutrients have been studied for their potential influence on prostate cancer risk.  The effect of selenium and vitamin E in preventing prostate cancer was studied in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT).

Excluding subsequent prostate cancer and adjusting for the risk of death from other causes, the cumulative incidence of a second primary cancer among all patients was 15.2% at 25 years (95% CI, 5.01–5.4).  There was a significant risk of new malignancies (all cancers combined) among men diagnosed prior to age 50 years, no excess or deficit in cancer risk in men aged 50 to 59 years, and a deficit in cancer risk in all older age groups. The authors suggested that this deficit may be attributable to decreased cancer surveillance in an elderly population. Excess risks of second primary cancers included cancers of the small intestine, soft tissue, bladder, thyroid, and thymus, and melanoma.  Prostate cancer diagnosed in patients aged 50 years or younger was associated with an excess risk of pancreatic cancer.<Reference refidx="48"/></Para><Para id="_678">The underlying etiology of developing a second primary cancer after prostate cancer may be related to various factors.  Some of the observed excess risks could be associated with prior radiation therapy.  Radiation therapy as the initial treatment for prostate cancer was found to increase the risk of bladder and rectal cancers and cancer of the soft tissues.  More than 50% of the small intestine tumors were carcinoid malignancies, suggesting possible hormonal influences.  The excess of pancreatic cancer may be due to mutations in <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>, which predisposes to both.  The risk of melanoma was most pronounced in the first year of follow-up after diagnosis, raising the possibility that this is the result of increased screening and surveillance.<Reference refidx="48"/></Para><Para id="_679">One Swedish study using the nationwide Swedish Family Cancer Database assessed the role of family history in the risk of a second primary cancer after prostate cancer.  Of 18,207 men with prostate cancer, 560 developed a second primary malignancy.  Of those, the RR was increased for colorectal, kidney, bladder, and squamous cell skin cancers.  Having a paternal family history of prostate cancer was associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer, myeloma, and squamous cell skin cancer.  Among prostate cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460211">probands</GlossaryTermRef>, those with a <Strong>family history</Strong> of colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, or chronic lymphoid leukemia were at  increased risk of that specific cancer as a second primary cancer.<Reference refidx="49"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_657"><Title>Risk of Other Cancers in Multiple-Case Families</Title><Para id="_658">Several reports have suggested an elevated risk of various other cancers among relatives within multiple-case prostate cancer families, but none of these associations have been established definitively.<Reference refidx="50"/><Reference refidx="51"/><Reference refidx="52"/></Para><Para id="_659">In a population-based Finnish study of 202 multiple-case prostate cancer families, no excess risk of all cancers combined (other than prostate cancer) was detected in 5,523 family members.

No difference in familial cancer risk was observed when families affected by clinically aggressive prostate cancers were compared with those having nonaggressive prostate cancer. These data suggest that familial prostate cancer is a cancer site–specific disorder.<Reference refidx="53"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_18"><Title>Inheritance of Prostate Cancer Risk</Title><Para id="_20">Many types of epidemiologic studies (case-control, cohort, twin, family) strongly suggest that prostate cancer susceptibility genes exist in the population.  An analysis of monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs in Scandinavia concluded that 42% (95% CI, 29–50) of prostate cancer risk may be accounted for by heritable factors.<Reference refidx="54"/>  This is in agreement with a previous U.S. study that showed a concordance of 7.1% between dizygotic twin pairs and a 27% concordance between monozygotic twin pairs.<Reference refidx="55"/> The first segregation analysis was performed in 1992 using families from 740 consecutive probands who had radical prostatectomies between 1982 and 1989. The study results suggested that familial clustering of disease among men with early-onset prostate cancer was best explained by the presence of a rare (frequency of 0.003) <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339338">autosomal dominant</GlossaryTermRef>, highly <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339344">penetrant</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339337">allele(s)</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="12"/>  Hereditary prostate cancer susceptibility genes were predicted to account for almost half of early-onset disease (age 55 years or younger).  In addition, early-onset disease has been further supported to have a strong genetic component from the study of common variants associated with disease onset before age 55 years.<Reference refidx="56"/></Para><Para id="_223">Subsequent segregation analyses generally agreed with the conclusions but differed in the details regarding frequency, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339344">penetrance</GlossaryTermRef>, and mode of inheritance.<Reference refidx="57"/><Reference refidx="58"/><Reference refidx="59"/>  A study of 4,288 men who underwent radical prostatectomy between 1966 and 1995 found that the best fitting genetic model of inheritance was the presence of a rare, autosomal dominant susceptibility gene (frequency of 0.06).  In this study, the lifetime risk in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460132">carriers</GlossaryTermRef> was estimated to be 89% by age 85 years and 3.9% for <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000556483">noncarriers</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="55"/>   This study also suggested the presence of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339333">genetic heterogeneity</GlossaryTermRef>, as the model did not reliably predict prostate cancer risk in FDRs of probands who were diagnosed at age 70 years or older. More recent segregation analyses have concluded that there are multiple genes associated with prostate cancer <Reference refidx="60"/><Reference refidx="61"/><Reference refidx="62"/><Reference refidx="63"/> in a pattern similar to  other adult-onset <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339343">hereditary cancer syndromes</GlossaryTermRef>, such as those involving the breast, ovary, colorectum, kidney, and melanoma. In addition, a segregation analysis of 1,546 families from Finland found evidence for Mendelian recessive inheritance.  Results showed that individuals carrying the risk allele were diagnosed with prostate cancer at younger ages (&lt;66 years) than noncarriers. This is the first segregation analysis to show a recessive mode of inheritance.<Reference refidx="64"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">American Cancer Society: Cancer Facts and Figures 2015.

Specific methodologies inform of unique <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460203">phenotypes</GlossaryTermRef> or inheritance patterns.  The sections below describe prostate cancer research utilizing various methods to highlight their role in uncovering the genetic basis of prostate cancer.  In an effort to identify disease <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460209">susceptibility genes</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460161">linkage</GlossaryTermRef> studies are typically performed on high-risk extended families in which multiple cases of a particular disease have occurred.  Typically, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045693">gene</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046063">mutations</GlossaryTermRef> identified through <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000425374">linkage analyses</GlossaryTermRef> are rare in the population, highly penetrant in families, and have large effect sizes.  The clinical role of mutations that are  identified in linkage studies is a clearer one, establishing precedent for genetic testing for cancer with genes such as <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>. (Refer to the <GeneName><SummaryRef href="CDR0000299612#_1051" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq">BRCA1 and BRCA2</SummaryRef></GeneName> section in the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000299612#_922" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq">Genes With Potential Clinical Relevance in Prostate Cancer Risk</SummaryRef>
section of this summary for more information about these genes.) <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000636779">Genome-wide association studies</GlossaryTermRef> (GWAS) are another methodology used to identify candidate <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460162">loci</GlossaryTermRef> associated with prostate cancer.  Genetic variants identified from GWAS typically are common in the population and have modest effect sizes for prostate cancer risk.  The clinical role of markers identified from GWAS is an active area of investigation.  Case-control studies are useful in validating the  findings of linkage studies and GWAS as well as for studying candidate gene alterations for association with prostate cancer risk, although the clinical role of findings from case-control studies needs to be further defined. </Para><SummarySection id="_28"><Title>Linkage Analyses</Title><SummarySection id="_22"><Title>Introduction to linkage analyses</Title><Para id="_23">The recognition that prostate cancer clusters within families has led many investigators to collect multiple-case families with the goal of localizing prostate cancer susceptibility genes through linkage studies.  </Para><Para id="_24">Linkage studies are typically performed on high-risk <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460158">kindreds</GlossaryTermRef> in whom multiple cases of a particular disease have occurred in an effort to identify disease susceptibility genes.

If such evidence is found (linkage), it provides statistical data that the chromosomal region near the marker also harbors a disease susceptibility gene. Once a genomic region of interest has been identified through linkage analysis, additional studies are required to prove that there truly is a susceptibility gene at that position. Linkage analysis is affected by the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_504" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Family size and having a sufficient number of family members who volunteer to contribute <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045671">DNA</GlossaryTermRef>.</ListItem><ListItem>The number of disease cases in each family.</ListItem><ListItem>Factors related to age at disease onset (e.g., utilization of screening).</ListItem><ListItem>Gender differences in disease risk (not relevant in prostate cancer but remains relevant in linkage analysis for other conditions).</ListItem><ListItem>Heterogeneity of disease in cases (e.g., aggressive vs. nonaggressive phenotype).</ListItem><ListItem>The accuracy of family history information.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_126"> Furthermore, because a standard definition of hereditary prostate cancer has not been accepted, prostate cancer linkage studies have not used consistent criteria for enrollment.<Reference refidx="1"/>  One criterion that has been proposed is the Hopkins Criteria, which provides a working definition of hereditary prostate cancer families.<Reference refidx="2"/>  Using the Hopkins Criteria, kindreds with prostate cancer need to fulfill only one of following criteria to be considered to have hereditary prostate cancer:</Para><OrderedList id="_213" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>Three or more affected <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460150">first-degree relatives</GlossaryTermRef> (father, brother, son).</ListItem><ListItem>Affected relatives in three successive generations of either maternal or paternal lineages.</ListItem><ListItem>At least two relatives affected at age 55 years or younger.</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_214">Using these criteria, surgical series have reported that approximately 3% to 5% of men will be from a family with hereditary prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_27">An additional issue in linkage studies is the high background rate of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339347">sporadic</GlossaryTermRef> prostate cancer in the context of family studies.  Because a man’s lifetime risk of prostate cancer is one in seven,<Reference refidx="4"/> it is possible that families under study have men with both <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045098">inherited</GlossaryTermRef> and sporadic prostate cancer.  Thus, men who do not inherit the prostate cancer susceptibility gene that is segregating in their family may still develop prostate cancer.  Currently there are no clinical or pathological features of prostate cancer that will allow differentiation between inherited and sporadic forms of the disease. Similarly, there are limited data regarding the clinical phenotype or natural history of prostate cancer associated with specific candidate loci. Measurement of the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been used inconsistently in evaluating families used in linkage analysis studies of prostate cancer.  In linkage studies, the 
definition of an affected man can be biased by the use of serum PSA screening as the rates of prostate cancer in families will differ between screened and unscreened families.</Para><Para id="_383">One way to address  inconsistencies between linkage studies is to require inclusion criteria that defines clinically significant disease (e.g., Gleason score ≥7,  PSA ≥20 ng/mL) in an affected man.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/> This approach attempts to define a homogeneous set of cases/families to increase the likelihood of identifying a linkage signal.

Conflicting evidence exists regarding the linkage to some of the loci described above.  Data on the proposed phenotype associated with each locus are also limited, and the strength of repeated studies is needed to firmly establish these associations. Evidence suggests that many of these prostate cancer loci account for disease in a small subset of families, which is consistent with the concept that prostate cancer exhibits <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460163">locus heterogeneity</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para><Table id="_1078">

In this respect, hereditary prostate cancer resembles a number of the other major adult-onset hereditary cancer syndromes, in which more than one gene can produce the same or very similar clinical phenotype (e.g., hereditary breast/ovarian cancer, Lynch syndrome, hereditary melanoma, and hereditary renal cancer).

Linkage analyses are designed to uncover rare, highly penetrant variants that segregate in predictable heritance patterns (e.g., <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339338">autosomal dominant</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339339">autosomal recessive</GlossaryTermRef>, X-linked, and mitochondrial). GWAS, on the other hand, are best suited to identify multiple, common, low-penetrance genetic polymorphisms. GWAS are conducted under the assumption that the genetic underpinnings of complex phenotypes, such as prostate cancer, are governed by many alleles, each conferring modest risk. Most genetic polymorphisms genotyped in GWAS are common, with minor allele frequencies greater than 1% to 5% within a given ancestral population (e.g., men of European ancestry).

ancestry</Title><Para id="_851">Most prostate cancer GWAS data generated to date have been derived from populations of European descent. This shortcoming is profound, considering that linkage disequilibrium structure, SNP frequencies, and incidence of disease differ across ancestral groups. To provide meaningful genetic data to all patients, well-designed, adequately powered GWAS must be aimed at specific ethnic groups.<Reference refidx="203"/> Most work in this regard has focused on African American, Chinese, and Japanese men. The most convincing associations reported to date for men of non-European ancestry are included in <SummaryRef href="CDR0000299612#_1236" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq">Table 5</SummaryRef>.

any other group.  In addition, inherited variation at the 8q24 risk locus appears to contribute to differences in African American and European American incidence of disease.<Reference refidx="69"/> A handful of studies have sought to determine whether GWAS findings in men of European ancestry are applicable to men of African ancestry. One study interrogated 28 known prostate cancer risk loci via fine mapping in 3,425 African American cases and 3,290 African American controls.<Reference refidx="205"/> On average, risk allele frequencies were 0.05 greater in African Americans than in European Americans. Of the 37 known risk SNPs analyzed, 18 replicated in the African American population were significantly associated with prostate cancer at <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> ≤ .05 (the study was underpowered to properly assess nine of the remaining 19 SNPs). For seven risk regions (2p24, 2p15, 3q21, 6q22, 8q21, 11q13, and 19q13),  fine mapping identified SNPs in the African American population more strongly associated with risk than the index SNPs reported in the original European-based GWAS. Fine mapping of the 8q24 region revealed four SNPs associated with disease that are substantially more common in African Americans. The SNP most strongly correlated with disease among African Americans (rs6987409) is not strongly correlated with a European risk allele and may account for a portion of increased risk in the African American population. In all, the risk SNPs identified in this study are estimated to represent 11% of total inherited risk.</Para><Para id="_855">Some of the risk variants identified in  <SummaryRef href="CDR0000299612#_1236" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq">Table 5</SummaryRef> have also been found to confer risk in men of European ancestry.  These include rs16901979, rs6983267, and rs1447295 at 8q24 in African Americans and rs13254738 in Japanese populations.  Additionally,  the Japanese rs4430796 at 17q12 and rs2660753 at 3p12 have also been observed in men of European ancestry.  However, the vast majority of the variants identified in these studies reveal novel variants that are unique to that specific ethnic population.  These results confirm the importance of evaluating SNP associations in different ethnic populations. Considerable effort is still needed to fully annotate genetic risk in these and other populations.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_843"><Title>Clinical application of GWAS findings</Title><Para id="_844">Because the variants discovered by GWAS are markers of risk, there has been great interest in using genotype as a screening tool to predict the development of prostate cancer. In an attempt to determine the potential clinical value of risk SNP genotype, cases of prostate cancer (n = 2,893) were identified from four cancer registries in Sweden. Controls (n = 1,781) were randomly selected from the Swedish Population Registry and were matched to cases by age and geographic region.<Reference refidx="78"/> Known risk SNPs from 8q24, 17q12, and 17q24.3 were analyzed (rs4430796 at 17q12, rs1859962 at 17q24.3, rs16901979 at 8q24 [region 2], rs6983267 at 8q24 [region 3], and rs1447295 at 8q24 [region 1]). ORs for prostate cancer for men carrying any combination of one, two, three, or four or more genotypes associated with prostate cancer were estimated by comparing them with men carrying none of the associated genotypes using logistic regression analysis. Men who carried one to five risk alleles had an increasing likelihood of having prostate cancer compared with men carrying none of the alleles (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = 6.75 × 10<Superscript>-27</Superscript>). After controlling for age, geographic location, and family history of prostate cancer, men carrying four or more of these alleles had a significant elevation in risk of prostate cancer (OR, 4.47; 95% CI, 2.93–6.80; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = 1.20 × 10<Superscript>-13</Superscript>). When family history was added as a risk factor, men with five or more factors (five SNPs plus family history) had an even stronger risk of prostate cancer (OR, 9.46; 95% CI, 3.62–24.72; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = 1.29 × 10<Superscript>-8</Superscript>). The population-attributable risks (PARs) for these five SNPs were estimated to account for 4% to 21% of prostate cancer cases in Sweden, and the joint PAR for prostate cancer of the five SNPs plus family history was 46%.</Para><Para id="_845">A second study assessed prostate cancer risk associated with a family history of prostate cancer in combination with various numbers of 27 risk alleles identified through four prior GWAS. Two case-control populations were studied, the Prostate, Lung, Colon, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) in the United States (1,172 cases and 1,157 controls) and the Cancer of the Prostate in  Sweden (CAPS) study (2,899 cases and 1,722 controls). The highest risk of prostate cancer from the CAPS population was observed in men with a positive family history and greater than 14 risk alleles (OR, 4.92; 95% CI, 3.64–6.64). Repeating this analysis in the PLCO population revealed similar findings (OR,  3.88; 95% CI, 2.83–5.33).<Reference refidx="211"/></Para><Para id="_846">However, the proportion of men carrying large numbers of the risk alleles was low. While ORs were impressively high for this subset, they do not reflect the utility of genotyping the overall population. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed in these studies to measure the sensitivity and specificity of certain risk profiles. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.61 when age, geographic region, and family history were used to assess risk. When genotype of the five risk SNPs at chromosomes 8 and 17 were introduced, a very modest AUC improvement to 0.63 was detected.<Reference refidx="78"/> The addition of more recently discovered SNPs to the model has not appreciably improved these results.<Reference refidx="212"/> While genotype may inform risk status for the small minority of men carrying multiple risk alleles, testing of the known panel of prostate cancer SNPs is currently of questionable clinical utility.<Reference refidx="213"/> </Para><Para id="_1125">Another study incorporated 10,501 prostate cancer cases and 10,831 controls from multiple cohorts (including PLCO) and genotyped each individual for 25 prostate cancer risk SNPs. Age and family history data were available for all subjects. Genotype data helped discriminate those who developed prostate cancer from those who did not. However, similar to the series above, discriminative ability was modest and only compelling at the extremes of risk allele distribution in a relatively small subset population; younger subjects (men aged 50 to 59 years) with a family history of  disease who were in 90th percentile for risk allele status had an absolute 10-year risk of 6.7% compared with an absolute 10-year risk of 1.6% in men in the 10th  percentile for risk allele status.<Reference refidx="214"/></Para><Para id="_1116">In July 2012, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) published a report that sought to address the clinical utility of germline genotyping of prostate cancer risk markers discovered by GWAS.<Reference refidx="213"/> Largely on the basis of the evidence  from the studies described above, AHRQ concluded that established prostate cancer risk SNPs have “poor discriminative ability” to identify individuals at risk of developing the disease. Similarly, the authors of another study estimated that the contribution of GWAS polymorphisms in determining the risk of developing prostate cancer will be modest, even as meta-analyses or larger studies uncover additional “common” risk alleles (alleles carried by &gt;1%–5% of individuals within the population).<Reference refidx="215"/> </Para><Para id="_1136">GWAS findings to date account for only a fraction of heritable risk of disease. Research is ongoing to uncover the remaining portion of genetic risk. This includes the discovery of rarer alleles with higher ORs for risk. For example, a consortium led by deCODE genetics in Iceland performed whole-genome sequencing of 2,500 Icelanders and identified approximately 32.5 million variants, including millions of rare variants (carried by &lt;1% of the population). These variants were analyzed in 5,141 prostate cancer cases and 54,444 controls (genotypes were imputed in cases in which they had not been genotyped in previous analyses).  In addition to previously reported risk alleles at 8q24 and 17q12, significant associations with prostate cancer were observed for two rare 8q24 SNPs—the minor allele (the G allele) of rs183373024 (OR,  2.69; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = 1.5 × 10<Superscript>−23</Superscript>) and the minor allele (the A allele) of rs188140481 (OR,  2.88; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = 1.5 × 10<Superscript>−22</Superscript>).<Reference refidx="216"/> These results were validated in independent cohorts of European cases and controls. The frequencies of the risk alleles of these two variants in controls ranged from 0.1% to 1.1% and were lowest in southern Europe and highest in northern Europe. These data, in which risk alleles had high ORs compared with previous GWAS, demonstrate that the bulk of inherited risk may reside in rare alleles.</Para><Para id="_1137">In addition, other genetic polymorphisms, such as copy number variants, are becoming increasingly amenable to testing. As the full picture of inherited prostate cancer risk becomes more complete, it is hoped that germline information will become clinically useful.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_847"><Title>GWAS and insight into the mechanism of prostate cancer risk</Title><Para id="_848">Notably, almost all reported prostate cancer risk alleles reside in nonprotein coding regions of the genome, and the underlying biological mechanism of disease susceptibility remains unclear. Hypotheses explaining the mechanism of inherited risk include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_1072" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Risk alleles discovered by GWAS are in linkage disequilibrium with exonic variants that directly influence gene products.</ListItem><ListItem>Risk alleles do in fact reside in areas of transcription, but transcription at these sites has not yet been annotated.</ListItem><ListItem>Risk alleles reside within regulatory elements and genotype within these areas influence activity of distal genes.<Reference refidx="217"/></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_849">The 8q24 risk locus, which contains multiple prostate cancer risk alleles and risk alleles for other cancers, has been the focus of intense study. <GeneName>c-MYC</GeneName>, a known oncogene, is the closest known gene to the 8q24 risk regions, although it is located hundreds of kb away. Given this significant distance, SNPs within <GeneName>c-MYC</GeneName> are not in linkage disequilibrium with the 8q24 prostate cancer risk variants. One study examined whether 8q24 prostate cancer risk SNPs are in fact located in areas of previously unannotated transcription, and no transcriptional activity was uncovered at the risk loci.<Reference refidx="218"/> Attention turned to the idea of distal gene regulation. Interrogation of the epigenetic landscape at the 8q24 risk loci revealed that the risk variants are located in areas that bear the marks of genetic enhancers, elements that influence gene activity from a distance.<Reference refidx="219"/><Reference refidx="220"/><Reference refidx="221"/> To identify a prostate cancer risk gene, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000561402">germline DNA</GlossaryTermRef> from 280 men undergoing prostatectomy for prostate cancer was genotyped for all known 8q24 risk SNPs. Genotypes were tested for association with the normal prostate and prostate tumor RNA expression levels of genes located within one Mb of the risk SNPs. No association was detected between expression of any of the genes, including <GeneName>c-MYC</GeneName>, and risk allele status in either normal epithelium or tumor tissue. Another study, using normal prostate tissue from 59 patients, detected an association between an 8q24 risk allele and the gene <GeneName>PVT1</GeneName>, downstream from <GeneName>c-MYC</GeneName>.<Reference refidx="222"/> Nonetheless, <GeneName>c-MYC</GeneName>, with its substantial involvement in many cancers, remains a prime candidate. A series of experiments in prostate cancer cell lines demonstrated that chromatin is configured in such a way that the 8q24 risk variants lie in close proximity to <GeneName>c-MYC</GeneName>, even though they are quite distant in linear space. These data implicate <GeneName>c-MYC</GeneName> despite the absence of expression data.<Reference refidx="220"/><Reference refidx="222"/> Further work at 8q24 and similar analyses at other prostate cancer risk loci are ongoing.</Para><Para id="_1277">Additional insights are emerging regarding the potential interaction between SNPs identified from GWAS and prostate cancer susceptibility gene regulation.  One study found that a SNP at 6q22 lies within a binding region for HOXB13.  Through multiple functional approaches, the T allele of this SNP (rs339331) was found to enhance binding of HOXB13, leading to allele-specific upregulation  of <GeneName>RFX6</GeneName>, which correlates with prostate cancer progression and severity.<Reference refidx="223"/> Thus, this study supports the hypothesis that  risk alleles identified from GWAS may play a role in regulating or modifying gene expression and therefore impact prostate cancer risk.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1200"><Title>Modified approaches to GWAS</Title><Para id="_1201">A 2012 study used a novel approach to identify polymorphisms associated with risk.<Reference refidx="224"/> On the basis of the well-established principle that the AR plays a prominent role in prostate tumorigenesis, the investigators targeted SNPs that reside at sites where the AR binds to DNA. They leveraged data from previous studies that mapped thousands of AR binding sites genome-wide in prostate cancer cell lines to select SNPs to genotype in the Johns Hopkins Hospital cohort of 1,964 cases and 3,172 controls and the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility  cohort of 1,172 cases and 1,157 controls. This modified GWAS revealed a SNP (rs4919743) located at the <GeneName>KRT8</GeneName> locus at 12q13.13—a locus previously implicated in cancer development—associated with prostate cancer risk, with an OR of 1.22 (95% CI, 1.13–1.32). The study is notable for its use of a reasonable hypothesis and prior data to guide a genome-wide search for risk variants.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_856"><Title>Conclusions</Title><Para id="_857">Although the statistical evidence for an association between genetic variation at these loci and prostate cancer risk is overwhelming, the clinical relevance of the variants and the mechanism(s) by which they lead to increased risk are unclear and will require further characterization. Additionally, these loci are associated with very modest risk estimates and explain only a fraction of overall inherited risk. Further work will include genome-wide analysis of rarer alleles catalogued via sequencing efforts, such as the 1000 Genomes Project.<Reference refidx="225"/> Disease-associated alleles with frequencies of less than 1% in the population may prove to be more highly penetrant and clinically useful. In addition, further work is needed to describe the landscape of genetic risk in non-European populations. Finally, until the individual and collective influences of genetic risk alleles are evaluated prospectively, their clinical utility will remain difficult to fully assess.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_645"><Title>Inherited Variants Associated With Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness</Title><Para id="_1270">Prostate cancer is clinically heterogeneous. Many cases are indolent and are successfully managed with observation alone. Other cases are quite aggressive and prove deadly. Several variables are used to determine prostate cancer aggressiveness at the time of diagnosis, such as Gleason score and PSA, but these are imperfect. Additional markers are needed, as sound treatment decisions depend on accurate prognostic information. Germline genetic variants are attractive markers since they are present, easily detectable, and static throughout life. Several studies have interrogated inherited variants that may distinguish indolent and aggressive prostate cancer. Several of these studies identified polymorphisms associated with aggressiveness, after adjusting for commonly used clinical variables, and are reviewed in the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000299612#_1274" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq">Table 6</SummaryRef>.</Para><Para id="_1275">Findings to date regarding inherited risk of aggressive disease are considered preliminary. Further work is needed to validate findings and assess prospectively.</Para><Para id="_1271">Like studies of the genetics of prostate cancer risk, initial studies of inherited risk of aggressive prostate cancer focused on polymorphisms in candidate genes. Next, as GWAS revealed prostate cancer risk SNPs, several research teams sought to determine whether certain risk SNPs were also associated with aggressiveness (see table <SummaryRef href="CDR0000299612#_1274" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq">below</SummaryRef>). There has been great interest in launching more unbiased, genome-wide searches for inherited variants associated with indolent versus aggressive prostate cancer. While GWAS designed explicitly for disease aggressiveness have been initiated, most genome-wide analyses to date have relied on datasets previously generated to evaluate prostate cancer risk. The cases from these case-control cohorts were divided into aggressive and nonaggressive subgroups then compared with  each other and/or with the control (nonprostate cancer) subjects. Several associations between germline markers and prostate cancer aggressiveness have been reported. However, there remains no accepted set of germline markers that clearly provides prognostic information beyond that provided by more traditional variables at the time of diagnosis.</Para><Table id="_1274"><Title>Table 6.

The risk of prostate cancer in male mutation carriers in the WAS cohort was elevated by age 50 years, was statistically significantly elevated by age 67 years, and increased thereafter with age, suggesting both an overall excess in prostate cancer risk and an earlier age at diagnosis among carriers of Ashkenazi  founder mutations. Prostate cancer risk differed depending on the gene, with <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> mutations associated with increasing risk after age 55 to 60 years, reaching 25% by age 70 years and 41% by age 80 years.

Scattered case reports have suggested that prostate cancer may be observed in men harboring an MMR gene mutation.<Reference refidx="34"/> The first quantitative study described nine cases of prostate cancer occurring in a population-based cohort of 106 Norwegian male MMR mutation carriers or obligate carriers.<Reference refidx="35"/> The expected number of cases among these 106 men was 1.52 (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .01); the men were younger at the time of diagnosis (60.4 years vs. 66.6 years, <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .006) and had more evidence of Gleason score of 8 to 10 (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .00001) than the cases from the Norwegian Cancer Registry.  Kaplan Meier analysis revealed that the cumulative risk of prostate cancer diagnosis by age 70 years was 30% in MMR gene mutation carriers and 8% in the general population.  This finding awaits confirmation in additional populations. A population-based case-control study examined haplotype-tagging SNPs in three MMR genes (<GeneName>MLH1</GeneName>, <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName>, and <GeneName>PMS2</GeneName>). This study provided some evidence supporting the contribution of genetic variation in <GeneName>MLH1</GeneName> and overall risk of prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="36"/>  To assess the contribution of prostate cancer as a feature of Lynch Syndrome, one study performed microsatellite instability (MSI) testing on prostate cancer tissue blocks from families enrolled in a prostate cancer family registry who also reported a history of colon cancer.  Among 35 tissue blocks from 31 distinct families, two tumors from MMR mutation–positive families were found to be MSI-high. The authors conclude that MSI is rare in hereditary prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="37"/></Para><Para id="_1234">One study that included two familial cancer registries found an increased cumulative incidence and risk of prostate cancer among  198 independent mutation-positive families with Lynch syndrome.<Reference refidx="38"/> The cumulative lifetime risk of prostate cancer (to age 80 years) was 30.0% in MMR mutation carriers (95% CI, 16.54–41.30; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .07), whereas it was 17.84% in the general population, according to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program estimates.

Therefore, it is theoretically possible that the PPV and diagnostic yield will be higher for the DRE and for PSA in men with a genetic predisposition than in average-risk populations.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_1253">Most retrospective analyses of prostate cancer screening cohorts have reported PPV for PSA, with or without DRE, among high-risk men in the range of 23% to 75%.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/> Screening strategies (frequency of PSA measurements or inclusion of DRE) and PSA cutoff for biopsy varied among these studies, which may have influenced this range of PPV.  Cancer detection rates among high-risk men have been reported to be in the range of 4.75% to 22%.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>  Most cancers detected were of intermediate Gleason score (5–7), with Gleason scores of 8 or higher being detected in some high-risk men. Overall, there is limited information about the net benefits and harms of screening men at higher risk of prostate cancer. In addition, there is little evidence to support specific screening approaches in prostate cancer families at high risk. Risks and benefits of routine screening in the general population are discussed in the PDQ <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062755" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-screening-pdq">Prostate Cancer Screening</SummaryRef> summary.  On the basis of the available data, most professional societies and organizations recommend that high-risk men engage in shared decision-making with their health care providers and develop individualized plans for prostate cancer screening based on their risk factors.

  A small subset of the participants in these studies were men with a family history of prostate cancer or men of African descent.  Men with a family history of prostate cancer represented 16.7% of participants in the PCPT and 13% of participants in the REDUCE trial.  African American men represented 3.3% of PCPT participants and 2.3% of REDUCE participants.  Overall,  finasteride and dutasteride reduced the incidence of prostate cancer, but the evidence is inadequate to determine whether there is a reduction in mortality with these agents.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/> In the PCPT trial, absolute reduction in incidence for more than 7 years with finasteride was 6% (24.4% with placebo and 18.4% with finasteride); relative risk reduction (RRR) for incidence was 24.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.6%–30.6%). There was no difference in the number of men who died from prostate cancer in the two groups, although the number of deaths was low.

It has been estimated that male relatives of men diagnosed with prostate cancer younger than  53 years have a 40% lifetime cumulative risk of developing prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="13"/>  A population-based case-control study of more than 1,500 cases and 1,600 controls, in which whites, African Americans, and Asian Americans were studied, reported an odds ratio of 2.5 for men with an affected first-degree relative after adjusting for age and ethnicity.<Reference refidx="14"/>  For men with a brother and father or son affected with prostate cancer, the RR was estimated to be 6.4.</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_296">A number of studies have examined the accuracy of the family history of prostate cancer provided by men with prostate cancer.

In an Australian study of 154 unaffected men with a family history of prostate cancer, self-reported family history was verified from cancer registry data in 89.6% of cases.<Reference refidx="15"/> Accuracy of age at diagnosis within a 3-year range was correct in 83% of the cases, and accuracy of age at diagnosis within a 5-year range was correct in 93% of the cases. Self-reported family history from men younger than 55 years and reports about first-degree relatives had the highest degree of accuracy.<Reference refidx="15"/> Self-reported family history of prostate cancer, however, may not be reliably reported over time,<Reference refidx="16"/> which underscores the need to verify objectively reported prostate cancer diagnoses when trying to determine whether a patient has a significant family history.</Para><Para id="_297">The personal health and risk-factor history includes,  but is not limited to, the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_381" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Family history.</ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000299612#_5" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq">Age</SummaryRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000299612#_5" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq">Race</SummaryRef>.</ListItem><ListItem>Current and past diet history, including fat intake.</ListItem><ListItem>Current and past use of drugs that can affect prostatic growth, such as steroids (e.g., finasteride [Proscar]).

In a Swedish study, male  FDRs of prostate cancer patients who reported more worry about developing prostate cancer had higher Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) depression and anxiety scores than men with lower levels of worry. In that study, the average HADS depression and anxiety scores among  FDRs was at the 75<Superscript>th</Superscript> percentile. Depression was associated with higher levels of personal risk overestimation.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_187"><Strong>Distress experienced during prostate cancer screening:</Strong> A study measured the anxiety and general quality of life experienced by 220 men with a family history of prostate cancer while undergoing prostate cancer screening with PSA tests.<Reference refidx="32"/> In this group, 20% of the men experienced a moderate deterioration in their anxiety scores, and 20% experienced a minimal deterioration in health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The average period between assessments was 35 days, which encompassed PSA testing and a wait for results that averaged 15.6 days. Only men with normal PSA values (4 ng/mL or less) were assessed.  Factors associated with deterioration in HRQOL included being  age 50 to  60 years, having more than two relatives with prostate cancer, having an anxious personality, being well-educated, and having no children presently living at home. These authors stress that analysis of the impact of screening on  FDRs should not rely solely on mean changes in scores, which may “mask diversity among responses, as illustrated by the proportion of subjects worsening during the screening process.” Given that these were men receiving what was considered a normal result and that a subset of men experienced screening-associated distress, this study suggests that interventions to reduce screening-related distress may be needed to encourage men at increased hereditary risk to comply with repeated requests for screening.</Para><Para id="_409">A study in the United Kingdom assessed predictors of psychological morbidity and screening adherence in  FDRs of men with prostate cancer participating in a PSA screening study.  One hundred twenty-eight  FDRs completed measures assessing psychological morbidity, barriers, benefits, knowledge of PSA screening, and perceived susceptibility to prostate cancer.  Overall, 18 men (14%) scored above the threshold for psychiatric morbidity, consistent with normal population ranges.  Cancer worry was positively associated with health anxiety, perceived risk, and subjective stress. However, psychological morbidity did not predict PSA screening adherence. Only past screening behavior was found to be associated with PSA screening adherence.<Reference refidx="38"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="9568607">Weinrich SP, Weinrich MC, Boyd MD, et al.: The impact of prostate cancer knowledge on cancer screening.
