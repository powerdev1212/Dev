</Para><Para id="_6">Primary brain tumors are a diverse group of diseases that together constitute the most common solid tumor of childhood. Brain tumors are classified according to histology, but tumor location and extent of spread are important factors that affect treatment and prognosis. Immunohistochemical analysis, cytogenetic and molecular genetic findings, and measures of mitotic activity are increasingly used in tumor diagnosis and classification. </Para><Para id="_115">Primary central nervous system (CNS) germ cell tumors (GCTs) are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms that account for 0.5% of all primary brain tumors, with approximately 90% of the cases occurring before age 20 years.  They are broadly classified as germinomatous and nongerminomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCTs) based on clinicopathologic features. Alternatively, in Europe and Asia, these tumors are broadly classified into secreting  and nonsecreting tumors, dependent on elevation of  serum and cerebrospinal tumor markers.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para><SummarySection id="_118"><Title>Incidence</Title><Para id="_119">In Western countries,  GCTs represent less than  4% of primary brain tumors in children, while in series from Japan and Asia, CNS GCTs account for approximately 11% of pediatric CNS tumors.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_58"><Title>Anatomy</Title><Para id="_59">CNS GCTs usually arise in the pineal and/or suprasellar regions of the brain, as solitary or multiple lesions. Pineal region tumors occur twice as frequently as suprasellar tumors, but approximately 5% to 10% of patients have both suprasellar and pineal gland involvement at the time of diagnosis.<Reference refidx="7"/> Involvement of both sites is most commonly seen in pure germinomas.  Males have a higher incidence of GCT than do females, with males having a preponderance of pineal region primary tumors. Other areas that may be involved, though rare, include the basal ganglia, ventricles, thalamus, cerebral hemispheres, and the medulla.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/></Para><MediaLink ref="CDR0000768223" type="image/jpeg" alt="Drawing of the inside of the brain showing the supratentorium (the upper part of the brain) and the infratentorium (the lower back part of the brain).

The tumor markers AFP and beta-HCG are the most useful, although other markers, such as  placental alkaline phosphatase  and c-kit, are being investigated.  Distinguishing between different GCT types by CSF protein marker levels alone is somewhat arbitrary, and standards vary. For example, groups in the United States and Europe consider tumors as secreting if serum and/or CSF AFP levels are 10 ng/dL or higher and/or serum and/or CSF  beta-HCG levels are 50 mIU/mL or higher, whereas several European and Asian groups designate tumors with serum and/or CSF AFP levels of 50 ng/mL or higher and/or beta-HCG levels of 100 mIU/mL or higher as secreting GCTs.
