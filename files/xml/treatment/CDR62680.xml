child who has a brain tumor or spinal cord tumor include the following:
</Para><OrderedList id="_108" Style="Arabic" Compact="No"><ListItem>The cause of most childhood brain tumors remains unknown.<Reference refidx="1"/></ListItem><ListItem>Selection of an appropriate therapy can only occur if the correct
diagnosis is made and the stage of the disease is accurately determined.</ListItem><ListItem>Children with primary brain or spinal cord tumors represent a major therapy challenge that,
for optimal results, requires the coordinated efforts of pediatric specialists
in fields such as neurosurgery, neuropathology,
radiation oncology,  pediatric oncology, neuro-oncology, neurology, rehabilitation, neuroradiology, endocrinology, and
psychology, who have special expertise in the care of patients with these
diseases.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/> For example, radiation therapy of pediatric brain tumors is technically demanding  and should be performed in centers that have experience in this area.</ListItem><ListItem>For most childhood brain and spinal cord tumors, the optimal treatment regimen
has not been determined.  Children who have brain and spinal cord tumors should be
considered for enrollment in a clinical trial when an appropriate study
is available.  Such clinical trials are being carried out by institutions
and cooperative groups.  
 Survival of childhood cancer has advanced as a result of clinical trials that have attempted to improve upon the best accepted therapy available.  Clinical trials in pediatrics are designed to compare new therapy with therapy that is currently accepted as standard. This comparison may be done in a randomized study of two treatment arms or by evaluating a single new treatment and then comparing the results with those previously obtained from existing therapy. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials">NCI website</ExternalRef>.</ListItem><ListItem>While more than 70% of children diagnosed with brain tumors will survive for more than 5
years after diagnosis, survival rates are wide-ranging depending on tumor type and stage.  Long-term sequelae related to the initial presence of the tumor and subsequent treatment are common.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/> Debilitating effects on growth and neurologic development have frequently been
observed after radiation therapy, especially in younger children. 
Secondary tumors have increasingly been diagnosed in long-term survivors.<Reference refidx="7"/> 
For this reason, the role of chemotherapy in allowing a delay or reduction in the
administration of radiation therapy is under study, and preliminary results
suggest that chemotherapy can be used to delay,  limit, and sometimes obviate, the need
for radiation therapy in children with benign and malignant lesions.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/> 
Long-term management of these patients is complex and requires a
multidisciplinary approach.  <Para id="_396">(Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000343584" url="/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq">Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer</SummaryRef> for more information about  possible long-term or late effects.)</Para></ListItem><ListItem>Guidelines for pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment

Biopsy or surgical re-resection may be necessary for confirmation of relapse; other entities, such as secondary tumor and treatment-related brain necrosis, may be clinically indistinguishable from tumor recurrence.
