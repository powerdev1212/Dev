Chronic HBV infection is the leading cause of HCC in Asia and Africa.   HCV infection is the leading cause of HCC in North America, Europe, and Japan.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Para id="_12">The annual incidence of HCC in HBV carriers is 0.5% to 1% per year in  patients without cirrhosis and 2.5% per year in  patients with cirrhosis. The relative risk of HCC is 100 (i.e., carriers of HBV are 100 times more likely to develop HCC than uninfected persons).<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_13">In a single, prospective, population-based study that included 12,008 patients, the presence of anti-HCV positivity conferred a twentyfold increased risk of HCC compared with persons who were anti-HCV negative.<Reference refidx="8"/> HCC may occur in HCV-infected patients with bridging fibrosis, even in the absence of overt cirrhosis.<Reference refidx="9"/>  However, the risk is highest among  patients with HCV-related established cirrhosis, which has an incidence rate of HCC of 2% to 8% per year.<Reference refidx="4"/> </Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Alcoholic cirrhosis:</Strong>  Several reports suggest that alcoholic cirrhosis is a risk factor for HCC. However, the true incidence of HCC in alcoholic cirrhosis is unknown because most epidemiology reports on this subject were published before the identification of HCV.<Reference refidx="3"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Metabolic syndrome:</Strong>     The risk factors associated with  metabolic syndrome, including insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity,  have been recognized as potential causes of nonalcoholic hepatosteatosis, cirrhosis, and HCC. However, no study to date has followed a sufficiently large group of these patients for long enough to describe the  incidence of HCC caused by metabolic syndrome.<Reference refidx="10"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Biliary cirrhosis:</Strong> The incidence of HCC in stage IV primary biliary cirrhosis is approximately the same as in cirrhosis resulting from hepatitis C.<Reference refidx="11"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Chronic liver injury:</Strong>  Chronic liver injury probably increases the risk of HCC, especially in patients who develop cirrhosis. The 5-year cumulative risk of developing HCC for patients with cirrhosis ranges between 5% and 30% and depends on etiology (highest in individuals with HCV infection), region or ethnicity (highest in Asians), and stage of cirrhosis.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000561227">Level of evidence: 3iii</LOERef>]</ListItem><ListItem>	<Strong>Hemochromatosis:</Strong>  Hemochromatosis is  a significant risk factor for HCC and has an increased relative risk twenty times that of the normal population.<Reference refidx="14"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Aflatoxin B1:</Strong>  Aflatoxin B1 is produced by fungi of the <Emphasis>Aspergillus</Emphasis> species and is a common contaminant of grain, nuts, and vegetables in some parts of Asia and Africa.

In the venous phase, the HCC enhances less than the surrounding liver (which is referred to as the venous washout of HCC), because the arterial blood flowing through the lesion no longer contains contrast; however, the portal blood in the liver now contains contrast.</Para><Para id="_25">The presence of arterial uptake followed by washout in a single dynamic study is highly specific (95%–100%) for  HCC of 1 to 3 cm in diameter and virtually diagnostic of HCC.<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000641572">Level of evidence: 3ii</LOERef>] In these cases, the diagnosis of HCC may be established without the need for a second imaging modality, even in the absence of a biopsy confirmation.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000641572">Level of evidence: 3ii</LOERef>]   </Para><Para id="_26">However, if a first imaging modality, such as  a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI, is not conclusive, sequential imaging with a different modality can improve sensitivity for HCC detection (from 33% to 41% for either CT or MRI to 76% for both studies when performed sequentially) without a decrease in specificity.<Reference refidx="19"/></Para><Para id="_27">If, despite the use of two imaging modalities, a lesion larger than 1 cm remains uncharacterized in a patient at high risk for HCC (i.e., with no or only one classic enhancement pattern), a liver biopsy can be considered.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="20"/> </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_28"><Title>Liver biopsy</Title><Para id="_29">A liver biopsy may be performed when a diagnosis of HCC is not established by a dynamic imaging modality (three-phase CT or MRI) for liver lesions 1 cm or larger in high-risk patients. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_30"><Title>Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels</Title><Para id="_31">AFP is insufficiently sensitive or specific for use as a diagnostic assay.
