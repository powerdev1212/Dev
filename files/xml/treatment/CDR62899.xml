develops in young and middle-aged men.  Most testicular  cancers are germ cell tumors.  For treatment planning, germ cell tumors are  broadly divided
into seminomas and nonseminomas  because they have different prognostic and treatment algorithms.  For patients with seminoma (all
stages combined), the cure rate exceeds 90%.  For patients with low-stage
seminoma or nonseminoma, the cure rate approaches 100%.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_453"><Title>Risk Factors</Title><Para id="_454">Risk factors for testicular cancer include the following:<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_455" Style="bullet"><ListItem>An undescended testis (cryptorchidism).</ListItem><ListItem>A family history of testis cancer (particularly in a father or brother).</ListItem><ListItem>A personal history of testis cancer.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_456">Surgical correction of an undescended testis (orchiopexy) before puberty appears to lower the risk of testis cancer, but this isn't certain.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_710"><Title>Histopathology</Title><SummarySection id="_390"><Title>Types of testicular germ cell tumors: Seminomas versus nonseminomas</Title><Para id="_391">The five histopathological subtypes of testicular germ cell tumors include: </Para><ItemizedList id="_392" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Seminomas.</ListItem><ListItem>Embryonal carcinomas.</ListItem><ListItem>Teratomas.</ListItem><ListItem>Yolk sac tumors.</ListItem><ListItem>Choriocarcinomas.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_393">Tumors that are 100% seminoma are considered seminomas.  All other tumors, including those that  have a mixture of seminoma and nonseminoma components, are considered and should be
managed as nonseminomas.   Most nonseminomas consist of a mixture of the different germ-cell tumor subtypes. Tumors that appear to have a seminoma histology but are accompanied by an elevated
serum level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) should be treated as nonseminomas because seminomas do not produce AFP.
</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_711"><Title>Prognosis and Staging</Title><SummarySection id="_562"><Title>Serum tumor markers and testis cancer: AFP, beta-hCG, and LDH</Title><Para id="_563">Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG), and lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) play an important role as serum tumor markers in the staging and monitoring of germ cell tumors and should be measured prior to removing the involved testicle.<Reference refidx="9"/>  For patients with nonseminomas, the degree of tumor-marker elevation after the cancerous testicular has been removed is one of the most significant predictors of prognosis.<Reference refidx="10"/>  Serum tumor markers are also very useful for monitoring all stages of nonseminomas and for monitoring metastatic seminomas because elevated marker levels are often the earliest sign of relapse.  </Para><Para id="_564"><Strong>AFP:</Strong>  Elevation of serum AFP is seen in 40% to 60% of men with nonseminomas.  Seminomas do not produce AFP. Men who have an elevated serum AFP should be considered to have a mixed germ cell tumor (i.e., nonseminomatous germ cell tumors [NSGCT]) even if the pathology shows a pure seminoma, unless there is a more persuasive explanation for the elevated AFP, such as liver disease.  </Para><Para id="_565"><Strong>Beta-hCG:</Strong>  Elevation of the beta subunit of hCG is
found in approximately 14% of the patients with stage I pure seminoma prior to orchiectomy and in about half of patients with metastatic seminoma.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/>  Approximately 40% to 60% of men with nonseminomas have an elevated serum beta-hCG.  </Para><Para id="_566">Significant and unambiguously rising levels of AFP and/or hCG are an indication of relapsed germ cell tumor in most cases and are an indication for treatment even in the absence of radiological evidence of metastatic disease.  Nonetheless, tumor-marker elevations do need to be interpreted with caution.  For example, false-positive hCG levels can result from cross reactivity of the assay with luteinizing hormone, in which case an intramuscular injection of testosterone should result in normalization of hCG values.  There are also clinical reports of marijuana use resulting in elevations of serum hCG and some experts recommend querying patients about drug use and retesting hCG levels after a period of abstinence from marijuana use.  Similarly, AFP is chronically mildly elevated in some individuals for unclear reasons and can be substantially elevated by liver disease.    </Para><Para id="_567"><Strong>LDH:</Strong>  Seminomas and nonseminomas alike may result in elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) but such values are of less clear prognostic significance because LDH may be elevated in many different conditions unrelated to cancer.  A study of the utility of LDH in 499 patients with testicular germ cell tumor undergoing surveillance after orchiectomy or after treatment of stage II or III disease reported that 7.7% of patient visits had elevations in LDH unrelated to cancer, whereas only 1.4% of visits had cancer-related increases in LDH.<Reference refidx="14"/>  Of 15 relapses, LDH was elevated in six and was the first sign of relapse in one.  Over 9% of the men had a persistent false-positive increase in LDH.  The positive predictive value for an elevated LDH was 12.8%.  </Para><Para id="_568">A second study reported that among 494 patients with stage I germ cell tumors who subsequently relapsed, 125 had an elevated LDH at the time of relapse.  Of these 125, all had other evidence of relapse:  112 had a concurrent rise in AFP and/or hCG, one had CT evidence of relapse prior to the elevation in LDH, one had palpable disease on examination and one complained of back pain that led to imaging that revealed retroperitoneal relapse.<Reference refidx="15"/>  Measuring LDH thus appears to have little value during surveillance of germ cell tumors for relapse.  On the other hand, for patients with metastatic NSGCT, large studies of prognostic models have found the LDH level to be a significant independent predictor of survival on multivariate analysis.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="16"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_401"><Title>Staging and risk stratification</Title><Para id="_402">There are two major prognostication models for testicular cancer: staging,<Reference refidx="17"/> and for risk-stratification of men with distant and/or bulky retroperitoneal metastases, the International Germ Cell Cancer Consensus Group classification.<Reference refidx="10"/>  The prognosis of testicular germ cell tumors is determined by the following factors:</Para><OrderedList id="_403" Style="Arabic" Compact="No"><ListItem>Histology (seminoma vs. nonseminoma).</ListItem><ListItem>The extent to which the tumor has spread (testis only vs. retroperitoneal lymph node involvement vs. pulmonary or distant nodal metastasis vs. nonpulmonary visceral metastasis).</ListItem><ListItem>For nonseminomas, the degree to which serum tumor markers are elevated.<Reference refidx="10"/></ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_404">Thus, for men with disseminated seminomas, the main adverse prognostic variable is the presence of metastases to organs other than the lungs (e.g., bone, liver, or brain).

is the procedure of choice in diagnosing and treating a malignant testicular mass.<Reference refidx="19"/> 
As noted above, serum AFP, LDH, and hCG should be measured prior to orchiectomy. Transscrotal biopsy is not considered appropriate because of the risk of local
dissemination of tumor into the scrotum or its spread to inguinal lymph nodes.  A
retrospective analysis of reported series in which transscrotal approaches had
been used showed a small but statistically significant increase in local
recurrence rates compared with the recurrence rates when the inguinal approach was used (2.9% vs. 0.4%).<Reference refidx="20"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335155">Level of evidence: 3iiiDii</LOERef>]  Distant recurrence and survival rates, however,  were
indistinguishable in the two  approaches.  </Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_712"><Title>Diagnostics</Title><Para id="_412">Evaluation of the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, usually by CT scanning,  is an important aspect of
staging and treatment planning in adults with testicular cancer.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/>  Patients with a negative result have
a substantial chance of having microscopic involvement of the lymph nodes.  Nearly 20% of seminoma patients and 30% of nonseminoma patients with normal CT scans and serum tumor markers will subsequently relapse if not given additional treatment after orchiectomy.<Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/> For nonseminoma patients, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) increases the accuracy of staging but as many as 10% of men with normal imaging, normal tumor markers, and benign pathology at RPLND will still go on to relapse.<Reference refidx="26"/>  About 25% of patients with clinical stage I
nonseminomatous testicular cancer will be upstaged to pathologic stage II with
RPLND, and about 25% of clinical
stage II patients will be downstaged to pathologic stage I with RPLND.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/> In
prepubertal children, the use of serial measurements of AFP has proven sufficient for
monitoring response after initial orchiectomy.  Lymphangiography and
para-aortic lymph node dissection do not appear to be useful or necessary in
the proper staging and management of testicular cancer in prepubertal boys.<Reference refidx="29"/> (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062872#_114" url="/types/childhood-cancers/hp/unusual-cancers-childhood-pdq">Genital/Urinary Tumors</SummaryRef> section in the PDQ summary on  <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062872" url="/types/childhood-cancers/hp/unusual-cancers-childhood-pdq">Unusual Cancers of Childhood</SummaryRef> for more information.)</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_713"><Title>Follow-up and Survivorship</Title><Para id="_413">Patients who have been cured of testicular cancer have approximately a 2% cumulative risk of developing a cancer in the opposite testicle during the 15
years after initial diagnosis.<Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="31"/> Within this range, men with nonseminomatous primary tumors appear to have a lower risk of subsequent contralateral testis tumors than men with seminomas.</Para><Para id="_414">HIV-infected men are reported to be at increased risk for  developing testicular
seminomas.<Reference refidx="32"/> Depending on comorbid conditions such as active
infection, these men are generally managed similarly to non-HIV-infected
patients.</Para><Para id="_415">Because  the majority of testis cancer patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy are
curable, it is necessary  to be aware of possible long-term effects of
 the various treatment modalities, such as the following:
</Para><OrderedList id="_416" Style="Arabic" Compact="No"><ListItem><Strong>Fertility:</Strong>  Many patients have oligospermia or sperm abnormalities prior to
therapy, but semen analysis results generally become more normal after treatment.  The impact of standard chemotherapy on fertility in testis cancer patients is not well defined, although it is well documented that most men can father children after treatment, often without the use of cryopreserved semen.   In two, large studies, roughly  70%  of patients actually fathered children  after treatment for testicular cancer.<Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/> The likelihood of recovering fertility is related to the type of treatment received.  The children do not appear
to have an increased risk of congenital malformations, but the existing data are not adequate to properly investigate this issue.<Reference refidx="35"/><Reference refidx="36"/> It is recommended that men wait at least 3 months after completing chemotherapy before conceiving a child (unless using cryopreserved sperm collected before  chemotherapy was administered).<Reference refidx="36"/> <Para id="_417">Radiation therapy, used to treat pure seminomatous testicular cancers, can
cause fertility problems because of  radiation scatter to the remaining testicle
during radiation therapy to retroperitoneal lymph nodes (as evidenced in the SWOG-8711 trial, for example).<Reference refidx="37"/>  (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062859" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/sexuality-fertility-women/sexuality-hp-pdq">Sexuality and Reproductive Issues</SummaryRef> for more information on fertility.) Depending on scatter
dose, sperm counts fall after radiation therapy but may recover over the course of 1
to 2 years.  Shielding techniques can be used to decrease the radiation scatter
to the remaining normal testicle. Because chemotherapy, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, and radiation therapy can each result in infertility, men should be offered the opportunity to bank sperm before undergoing any treatment for testis cancer other than orchiectomy.</Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Secondary leukemias:</Strong>  Several reports of elevated risk of secondary acute
leukemia, primarily nonlymphocytic, have appeared.<Reference refidx="38"/><Reference refidx="39"/>  An increased risk of leukemia has been associated with platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation therapy.<Reference refidx="38"/> Etoposide-containing regimens are also associated with a
risk of secondary acute leukemias, usually in the myeloid lineage, and with a
characteristic 11q23 translocation.<Reference refidx="40"/><Reference refidx="41"/>  Etoposide-associated leukemias
typically occur sooner after therapy than alkylating agent-associated
leukemias and often show balanced chromosomal translocations on the long arm of
chromosome 11.  Standard etoposide dosages (&lt;2 g/m<Superscript>2</Superscript> cumulative dose) are associated with a relative risk of 15 to 25, but this
translates into a cumulative incidence of leukemia of less than 0.5% at 5
years.  Preliminary data suggest that cumulative doses of more than 2 g/m<Superscript>2</Superscript> of etoposide may confer higher risk.
</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Renal function:</Strong>  Minor decreases in creatinine clearance occur (about a 15%
decrease, on average) during platinum-based therapy, but these  appear to remain
stable in the long term and without significant deterioration.<Reference refidx="42"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Hearing:</Strong>  Bilateral hearing deficits occur with cisplatin-based
chemotherapy, but the  deficits generally occur at sound frequencies of 4 kHz to 8
kHz, which is outside the range of conversational tones;  therefore, hearing
aids are rarely required  if standard doses of cisplatin are administered.<Reference refidx="42"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Lung function:</Strong>  A study of pulmonary function tests in 1,049 long-term survivors of testis cancer reported a cisplatin-dose-dependent increase in the incidence of restrictive lung disease.<Reference refidx="43"/>  Whereas men receiving up to 850 mg of cisplatin had a normal risk of restrictive lung disease, men who received over 850 mg of cisplatin had a three-fold increased risk.  In absolute terms, patients who received no chemotherapy had an incidence of restrictive lung disease of less than 8%, whereas the incidence of restrictive lung disease among those receiving over 850 mg of cisplatin was nearly 18%.  However, only 9.5% of those with pulmonary function testing indicative of restrictive lung disease reported dyspnea.  Although cisplatin was more strongly associated with decreased lung function in this study, cumulative bleomycin dose was also associated with a decline in forced vital capacity and the 1-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1) but not with restrictive lung disease.</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_418">Although acute bleomycin pulmonary toxic effects may occur, they are rarely fatal at
total cumulative doses of less than 400 units.  Because life-threatening
pulmonary toxic effects can occur, the drug should be discontinued if early
signs of pulmonary toxic effects develop.  Although decreases in pulmonary
function are frequent, they are rarely symptomatic and are reversible after the
completion of chemotherapy.  Survivors of testis cancer who were treated with chemotherapy have been reported to be at increased risk of death from respiratory diseases, but it is unknown whether this finding is related to bleomycin exposure.<Reference refidx="44"/></Para><Para id="_419">Radiation therapy, often used in the management of pure seminomatous germ cell
cancers, has been linked to the development of secondary cancers, especially
solid tumors in the radiation portal, usually after a latency period of a
decade or more.<Reference refidx="45"/><Reference refidx="46"/>  These include melanoma and cancers of the stomach, bladder, colon,
rectum, pancreas, lung, pleura, prostate, kidney, connective tissue, and thyroid. 
Chemotherapy has also been associated with an elevated risk of secondary cancers.</Para><SummarySection id="_715"><Title>Other risk factors</Title><SummarySection id="_420"><Title>Cardiovascular disease in testicular cancer survivors</Title><Para id="_421">More recently, men with testis cancer who have been treated with radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy have been reported to be at increased risk of cardiovascular events.<Reference refidx="47"/><Reference refidx="48"/><Reference refidx="49"/>  Other studies have reported that chemotherapy for testis cancer is associated with an increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome and hypogonadism.<Reference refidx="50"/><Reference refidx="51"/>  Moreover, an international population-based study reported that men treated with either radiation or chemotherapy were at increased risk of death from circulatory diseases.<Reference refidx="44"/></Para><Para id="_459"> In a retrospective series of 992 patients treated for testicular cancer at the Royal Marsden Hospital between 1982 and 1992,  cardiac events were increased approximately 2.5-fold in patients treated with radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy compared with  those who underwent surveillance after a median of 10.2 years.  The actuarial risks of cardiac events were 7.2% for patients who received radiation therapy (92% of whom did not receive mediastinal radiation therapy), 3.4% for patients who received chemotherapy (primarily platinum-based), 4.1% for patients who received combined therapy, and 1.4% for patients who underwent surveillance management after 10 years of follow-up.<Reference refidx="48"/></Para><Para id="_423">   A population-based, retrospective study of 2,339 testicular cancer survivors in the Netherlands, treated between 1965 and 1995 and followed for a median of 18.4 years, found that the overall incidence of coronary heart disease (i.e., myocardial infarction and/or angina pectoris) was increased 1.17 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04–1.31) compared with  the general population.<Reference refidx="49"/>  Patients who received radiation therapy to the mediastinum had a 2.5-fold (95% CI, 1.8–3.4) increased risk of coronary heart disease, and those who also received chemotherapy had an almost 3-fold (95% CI, 1.7–4.8) increased risk.  Patients who were treated with infradiaphragmatic radiation therapy alone had no significantly increased risk of coronary heart disease.  In multivariate Cox regression analyses, the older chemotherapy regimen of cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin (PVB), used until the mid-1980s, was associated with a significant 1.9-fold (95% CI, 1.2–2.9) increased risk of cardiovascular disease (i.e., myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and heart failure combined).  The newer regimen of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) was associated with a borderline significant 1.5-fold (95% CI, 1.0–2.2) increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Similarly, an international pooled analysis of population-based databases reported that the risk of death from circulatory disease was increased in men treated with chemotherapy (standardized mortality ratio 1.58) or radiation therapy (SMR = 1.70).<Reference refidx="44"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335155">Level of evidence: 3iiiDii</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_424">Although testicular cancer is highly curable, all newly diagnosed patients are

TIN is analogous to carcinoma <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis>. In most cases, TIN is diagnosed as a result of an orchiectomy that was performed to remove an invasive germ cell tumor (pT1–T4); generally, TIN has  already been removed from the body at the time of diagnosis and requires no treatment. A more challenging situation arises if a biopsy is performed of the contralateral testis and TIN is discovered. Because of the low incidence and low mortality rates associated with contralateral germ cell tumors, such biopsies are performed rarely in the United States; therefore, TIN is almost never diagnosed in testicles that do not also have an invasive tumor. Consequently, a treatment decision about TIN in stage 0 testicular cancer  is  rarely faced in the United States. Treatment options for ITGCN include radiation therapy, surveillance, and orchiectomy.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_79"><Para id="_232"><Strong>Stage I</Strong></Para><Para id="_80">Stage I testicular cancer is limited to the testis.  Invasion of the scrotal
wall by tumor or interruption of the scrotal wall by previous surgery does not
change the stage but does increase the risk of spread to the inguinal lymph
nodes, and this must be considered in treatment and follow-up.  Invasion of the
epididymis tunica albuginea and/or the rete testis does not change the
stage.  Invasion of the tunica vaginalis or lymphovascular invasion signifies a T2 tumor, while invasion of the spermatic cord signifies a T3 tumor, and invasion of the scrotum signifies a T4.  Increases in T stage are associated with  increased risk of occult metastatic disease and recurrence.  Men with stage I disease who have persistently elevated serum tumor markers after orchiectomy are staged as IS, but stage IS nonseminomas are treated as stage III. Elevated serum tumor markers in stage I or II seminoma are of unclear significance except that a persistently elevated or rising hCG usually indicates metastatic disease.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_81"><Para id="_233"><Strong>Stage II</Strong></Para><Para id="_82">Stage II testicular cancer involves the testis and the retroperitoneal or
peri-aortic lymph nodes usually in the region of the kidney.  Retroperitoneal
involvement should be further characterized by the number of nodes involved and
the size of involved nodes.  The risk of recurrence is increased if more than five
nodes are involved or if the size of one  or more involved nodes is more than 2
cm.  Bulky stage II disease
(stage IIC) describes patients with extensive retroperitoneal nodes (&gt;5 cm), which portends a less favorable prognosis.

examination, imaging studies, and/or blood tests (i.e., patients with retroperitoneal adenopathy and highly elevated serum tumor markers are stage III).  Stage III can be further stratified based on the location of metastasis and the degree of elevation of serum tumor markers.  In the favorable group (IIIA), metastases are
limited to lymph nodes and lung, and serum tumor markers are no more than mildly elevated. Stage IIIB patients have moderately elevated tumor markers, while stage IIIC patients have highly elevated markers and/or metastases to liver, bone, brain or some organ other than the lungs.

treatment planning because seminomatous types of testicular cancer are more
sensitive to radiation therapy and chemotherapy and are less prone to distant metastases. Moreover, nonseminomas may include teratomatous elements, which tend to be resistant to chemotherapy and often require surgery for cure.  By definition, pure seminomas do not contain elements of teratoma.  Therefore, surgery plays a larger role in the management of nonseminomas than in the management of seminomas.

planning and expression of prognosis.  Bulky disease is generally defined as
tumors larger than 5 cm on a computed tomographic (CT) scan (i.e., stage IIC disease). Nonbulky disease can be further subdivided into stage IIA, meaning no lymph node mass larger than 2 cm, and stage IIB, meaning a lymph node mass between 2 cm and 5 cm.</Para><Para id="_141">Nonbulky stage II disease has a cure rate of about  90% to 95%  with radiation
alone at doses of 30 Gy to 36 Gy,<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> and most relapsing patients can be cured with chemotherapy.  Cure rates are slightly higher for patients with stage IIA disease than for those with IIB disease, but the figures are within the range given above.  Risk factors for relapse include multiple enlarged nodes.    
</Para><Para id="_442">Results for patients with stage IIC disease have been less favorable.  For example, one institution reported that 9 of 16 (56%) stage IIC patients relapsed following radiation therapy, while relapse occurred in only 1 of 23 (4%) IIC patients treated with chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="3"/>  A pooled analysis of earlier studies reported a 65% relapse-free survival (RFS) for men receiving radiation therapy for bulky stage II seminoma.<Reference refidx="5"/> Unfortunately, only sparse contemporary data are available on the use of radiation therapy to treat bulky stage II seminomas, and there are no randomized trials comparing radiation therapy with chemotherapy in this population.  Combination
chemotherapy with cisplatin is effective therapy in patients with bulky
stage II seminomas  and has become the most widely accepted treatment option.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_323">Residual radiologic abnormalities are common at the
completion of chemotherapy.  Many abnormalities gradually regress over a period
of months.  Some clinicians advocate empiric attempts to resect residual masses 3 cm or larger, while others advocate close surveillance, with intervention only if the residual mass increases in size.  Postchemotherapy radiation therapy is no longer favored, in part because of a retrospective
study of a consecutive series  of 174 seminoma patients with postchemotherapy residual
disease seen at ten treatment centers that reported that empiric radiation was not associated with
any medically significant improvement in progression-free survival after
completion of platinum-based combination chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="4"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335149">Level of evidence: 3iiDiii</LOERef>]  </Para><Para id="_460">In some series, surgical resection of specific masses has yielded a
significant number of patients with residual seminoma who require additional therapy.<Reference refidx="5"/> 
Nevertheless, other reports indicate that the size of the residual mass does not
correlate well with active residual disease, most residual masses do not grow,
and frequent marker and CT scan evaluation is a viable option even when the
residual mass is 3 cm or larger.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_324">A more recent approach has been to obtain an 18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan following chemotherapy.  A study of 56 patients reported that positron emission tomography (PET) scans correctly identified eight of ten patients with residual seminoma with no false positives among the 46 patients with benign masses.<Reference refidx="8"/>  In this study, PET scans were 100% accurate in patients with residual masses greater than 3 cm in greatest diameter whereas residual malignant masses less than 3 cm were only detected in one of three men.  This study provides support for observing men with residual FDG-PET-negative masses greater than 3 cm and for performing a biopsy or resection of any FDG-PET-positive mass.</Para><Para id="_142"><Strong>Standard treatment options for patients with nonbulky tumors:

Men with stage II disease and persistently elevated serum tumor markers are generally treated as having stage III disease and receive chemotherapy.  For men with normal markers after orchiectomy, nonseminomas are divided into stages IIA, IIB, and IIC for treatment purposes.  In general, stage IIA patients undergo RPLND to confirm the staging.  As many as 40% of clinical stage IIA patients will have benign findings at RPLND and will be restaged as having pathological stage I disease.<Reference refidx="13"/>  RPLND can thus prevent a significant number of clinical stage IIA patients from receiving unnecessary chemotherapy.  </Para><Para id="_546">In contrast, stage IIB and IIC patients are usually treated with systemic chemotherapy for disseminated disease because these patients have a higher relapse rate after RPLND.  One study reported that by limiting RPLND to patients with earlier stage II disease and normal serum tumor markers, 5-year RFS increased from 78% to 100% after RPLND, while RFS did not change significantly among stage II patients receiving chemotherapy (100% vs. 98%).<Reference refidx="14"/>  However, the question of whether to treat patients with stage II nonseminomas germ cell tumors with RPLND or chemotherapy has never been subjected to a randomized trial. </Para><Para id="_147"><Strong>Standard treatment options:

removal of residual masses should be performed.  The timing of such surgery
requires clinical judgment but would occur most often after three  or four  cycles of
combination chemotherapy and normalization or stabilization of serum markers.  The presence of persistently elevated markers is not a contraindication to resection of residual masses, but patients with rising markers at the end of chemotherapy are generally treated with salvage chemotherapy.  Despite numerous studies, no sufficiently accurate predictors of the histology of residual masses have been validated.  Therefore, the standard of care is to resect all residual masses
apparent on scans in patients who have normal or stable markers after responding to
chemotherapy.  The presence of persistent
nonseminomatous germ-cell malignant elements in the resected specimen is a poor prognostic sign and is often a trigger for additional chemotherapy. However, men with only microscopic residual cancer have a much more favorable prognosis than men with more substantial residual disease.<Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/>  Identifying the  patients who benefit from additional chemotherapy is not possible from existing data.  
</Para><Para id="_325">In some cases, chemotherapy is
initiated prior to orchiectomy because of life-threatening metastatic disease. 
When this is done, orchiectomy after initiation or completion of
chemotherapy is advisable to remove the primary tumor.  There is a
higher incidence (approximately 50%) of residual cancer in the testicle than in
remaining radiographically detectable retroperitoneal masses after platinum-based chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="31"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_TrialSearch_136_sid_7"><Title>Current Clinical Trials</Title><Para id="_TrialSearch_136_10">Check for U.S. clinical trials from NCI's list of cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with

If the diagnosis has been made by biopsy of a metastatic site (or on the basis of highly elevated serum tumor markers and radiological imaging consistent with an advanced-stage germ cell tumor) and chemotherapy has been initiated, subsequent orchiectomy is generally performed because chemotherapy may not eradicate the primary tumor. Case reports illustrate that viable tumor has been found on postchemotherapy orchiectomy despite complete response of metastatic lesions.<Reference refidx="16"/></Para><Para id="_624">Some retrospective data suggest that the experience of the treating institution

treated from 1990 to 1994 on the same study protocol at 49 institutions in the
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Medical
Research Council were analyzed.<Reference refidx="17"/>  Overall, the 2-year survival rate for the 55

Such masses are not treated unless they grow or are histopathologically shown to contain viable cancer.   In a combined retrospective consecutive series of 174 seminoma

empiric radiation was not associated with any medically significant improvement
in progression-free survival  after completion of platinum-based combination
chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="23"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335149">Level of evidence: 3iiDiii</LOERef>]  In some series, surgical
resection of specific masses has yielded a significant number of patients with residual
seminoma that require additional therapy.<Reference refidx="24"/> Larger masses are more likely to harbor viable cancer, but there is no size criteria with high sensitivity and specificity.  18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans have been shown to be helpful in identifying patients who harbor viable cancers, but the false-positive rate is substantial in some series.<Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/>  The strength of positron emission tomograph (PET) scans in residual seminoma masses is that they have a very high sensitivity and a low false-negative rate.  Thus, for men with residual masses for whom resection is being planned, a negative PET scan provides evidence that surgery is not necessary.    </Para><Para id="_470">Although larger residual masses are more likely to harbor viable seminoma, the size of the residual mass is of limited prognostic value.<Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/> Most residual masses do not grow, and regular marker and computed tomographic (CT) scan evaluation is a viable
management option for large or small masses.<Reference refidx="28"/> 
An alternative approach is to operate on larger masses, to resect them when possible, and to perform biopsies of unresectable masses.  Postchemotherapy masses are often difficult or impossible to resect because of a dense desmoplastic reaction.  Historically, such surgery has been characterized by a high rate of complications or additional procedures such as nephrectomy or arterial or venous grafting.<Reference refidx="29"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_350"><Title>Residual Masses After Chemotherapy in Men with Nonseminomas</Title><Para id="_582">Residual masses following chemotherapy in men with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors often contain viable cancer or teratoma,  and the standard of care is to resect all such masses when possible. However, there are no randomized, controlled trials evaluating this issue.  Instead, the practice is based on the fact that viable neoplasm is often found at surgery in these patients, and the presumption is that such tumors would progress if not resected.  If serum tumor markers are rising, salvage chemotherapy is usually given, but stable or slowly declining tumor markers are not a contraindication to resection of residual masses.</Para><Para id="_583">Case series of men undergoing postchemotherapy resections have reported that roughly 10% will have viable germ cell cancer, 45% will have teratoma, and 45% will have no viable tumor.<Reference refidx="30"/>  Numerous attempts have been made to identify the patients who need surgery and the patients who can be safely observed.

If it is not surgically feasible, resection is generally not performed.  Some patients  may have discordant pathologic findings (e.g., fibrosis/necrosis,      
teratoma, or carcinoma) in residual masses in the abdomen versus the            
chest. Some medical centers  perform simultaneous retroperitoneal      
and thoracic operations to remove residual masses,<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="33"/>  but most do not.   Although
the agreement among the histologies of residual masses found after chemotherapy
above the diaphragm versus those found below the diaphragm is only moderate (kappa statistic = 0.42),
 some evidence exists that if retroperitoneal resection is performed first,
results can be used to guide decisions about whether to perform a
thoracotomy.<Reference refidx="34"/></Para><Para id="_587">In a multi-institutional case series of surgery to remove
postchemotherapy residual masses in 159 patients, necrosis only was found at
thoracotomy in about 90% of patients who had necrosis only in their
retroperitoneal masses.  The figure was about 95% if the original testicular
primary tumor had contained no teratomatous elements.  Conversely, the
histology of residual masses at thoracotomy did not predict nearly as well the histology of retroperitoneal masses.<Reference refidx="34"/> Nonetheless, some centers continue to support resection of all residual masses, even if necrosis is found in the retroperitoneum.<Reference refidx="35"/></Para><Para id="_588">The presence of persistent malignant
elements in the resected specimen is considered by some clinicians to be an indication for additional
chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="36"/>  However, there are no prospective trials investigating the benefit of such treatment.  In some cases, chemotherapy is initiated before the
orchiectomy because of life-threatening metastatic disease.  When this is done,
orchiectomy after initiation or completion of chemotherapy is advisable to remove the primary tumor.  A
physiologic blood-testis barrier seems to appear, and there is a higher incidence (approximately
50%) of residual cancer in the testicle than in remaining radiographically
detectable retroperitoneal masses after platinum-based chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="16"/>  Some
investigators have suggested that in children, 90% of whom have yolk sac
tumors, radiation therapy should be given to residual masses after chemotherapy

cancer, previous treatment, site of recurrence, and individual patient
considerations.  Salvage regimens consisting of ifosfamide, cisplatin, and
either etoposide or vinblastine can induce long-term complete responses in 
about 25% of patients with disease that has persisted or recurred
following other cisplatin-based regimens.  Patients who have had an initial
complete response to first-line chemotherapy and those without extensive
disease have the most favorable outcomes.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>  This regimen is now the standard
initial salvage regimen.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>  Few, if any, patients with recurrent
nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of extragonadal origin, however,  achieve long-term
disease-free survival (DFS) using vinblastine, ifosfamide, and cisplatin if their
disease recurred after they received an initial regimen containing etoposide
and cisplatin.<Reference refidx="2"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335148">Level of evidence: 3iiDii</LOERef>]  
</Para><Para id="_689">High-dose chemotherapy with
autologous marrow transplantation has also been used in uncontrolled case series in the
setting of recurrent disease.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/> However, a randomized, controlled trial  comparing conventional doses of salvage chemotherapy with high-dose chemotherapy with autologous marrow rescue showed more toxic effects and treatment-related deaths in the high-dose arm without any improvement in response rate or overall survival.<Reference refidx="12"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335125">Level of evidence: 1iiA</LOERef>]  In some highly selected patients with chemorefractory
disease confined to a single site, surgical resection may yield long-term
DFS.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/>  One case series suggests that a maintenance regimen of daily oral
etoposide (taken 21 days out of 28 days) may benefit patients who achieve a complete
remission after salvage therapy.<Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Para id="_209">A special case of late relapse may include  patients who relapse more than 2 years
after achieving complete remission; this population represents less than 5% of
patients who are in complete remission after 2 years.  Results with
chemotherapy are poor in this patient subset, and surgical treatment appears to
be superior, if technically feasible.<Reference refidx="16"/>  Teratoma may be
amenable to surgery at relapse, and teratoma also has a better prognosis than carcinoma after late
relapse.  Teratoma is a relatively resistant histologic subtype,
so chemotherapy may not be appropriate.
</Para><Para id="_210">Clinical trials are appropriate and should be considered whenever possible,
including phase I and phase II studies for those patients who do not achieve a complete
remission with induction therapy, or for those who do not achieve a complete remission
following etoposide and cisplatin for their initial relapse,  or for patients who
have a second relapse.<Reference refidx="17"/>     </Para><SummarySection id="_TrialSearch_206_sid_9"><Title>Current Clinical Trials</Title><Para id="_TrialSearch_206_10">Check for U.S. clinical trials from NCI's list of cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with
