Brain tumors are classified according to histology, but tumor location and extent of spread are important factors that affect treatment and prognosis. Immunohistochemical analysis, cytogenetic and molecular genetic findings, and measures of mitotic activity are increasingly used in tumor diagnosis and classification. </Para><SummarySection id="_607"><Title>Disease Overview</Title><Para id="_608">  Embryonal tumors are a collection of biologically heterogeneous lesions that share the tendency to disseminate throughout  the nervous system via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathways. Although there is significant variability, histologically these tumors are grouped together because they are at least partially composed of hyperchromatic cells (blue cell tumors on standard staining) with little cytoplasm, which are densely packed and demonstrate a high degree of mitotic activity.  Other histologic and immunohistochemical features, such as the degree of apparent cellular transformation along identifiable cell lineages (ependymal, glial, etc.), can be used to separate these tumors to some degree.  However, a convention, which has been accepted by the World Health Organization (WHO), also separates these tumors based on presumed location of origin within the central nervous system (CNS). Molecular studies have substantiated the differences between tumors arising in different areas of the brain and give credence to this classification approach.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_614">The pathologic diagnosis of embryonal tumors is primarily based on histological and immunohistological microscopic features. However,  molecular genetic studies are employed increasingly to subclassify embryonal tumors.  These molecular genetic findings are now being utilized for risk stratification and treatment planning.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_609">The most recent WHO categorization of embryonal tumors is as follows:<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_610" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Medulloblastoma.</ListItem><ListItem>CNS primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET).<ItemizedList id="_558" Style="dash"><ListItem>CNS neuroblastoma.</ListItem><ListItem>CNS ganglioneuroblastoma.</ListItem><ListItem>Medulloepithelioma.</ListItem><ListItem>Ependymoblastoma.</ListItem></ItemizedList></ListItem><ListItem>Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor.

For example, more laterally positioned medulloblastomas of the cerebellum may not result in hydrocephalus, and because of their location, are more likely to result in lateralizing cerebellar dysfunction (appendicular ataxia) manifested by unilateral dysmetria, unsteadiness,  and weakness of the sixth and seventh nerves on the same side as the tumor.  Later, as the tumor grows towards the midline and blocks CSF, the more classical symptoms associated with hydrocephalus become evident.</Para><Para id="_624">Cranial nerve findings are less common, except for unilateral or bilateral sixth nerve palsies, which are usually related to hydrocephalus.<Reference refidx="20"/>  At times, medulloblastomas will present explosively with the acute onset of lethargy and unconsciousness due to hemorrhage within the tumor.</Para><Para id="_565">In infants, the presentation of medulloblastoma is more variable and may include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_625" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Nonspecific lethargy.</ListItem><ListItem>Psychomotor delays.</ListItem><ListItem>Loss of developmental milestones.</ListItem><ListItem>Feeding difficulties.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_626">On examination, there may be bulging of the anterior fontanel due to increased intracranial pressure and abnormal eye movements, including eyes that are deviated downward (the so-called <Emphasis>sun setting</Emphasis> sign) due to loss of upgaze secondary to compression of the tectum of the midbrain.</Para><SummarySection id="_669"><Title>Hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes associated with medulloblastoma</Title><Para id="_665">A small percentage of medulloblastoma cases arise in the setting of hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes.

Pineoblastomas often result in hydrocephalus due to blockage of CSF at the third ventricular level and other symptoms related to pressure on the back of the brain stem in the tectal region.  Symptoms may include a constellation of abnormalities in eye movements manifested by pupils that react poorly to light but better to accommodation, loss of upgaze, retraction or convergence nystagmus, and lid retraction (Parinaud syndrome).  As they grow, these tumors may also cause hemiparesis and ataxia.</Para><Para id="_567">Supratentorial lesions, such as CNS neuroblastomas and ganglioneuroblastomas, will result in focal neurologic deficits, such as hemiparesis and visual field loss, depending on which portion of the cerebral cortex is involved.  They may also result in seizures and obtundation.  Medulloepitheliomas and ependymoblastomas may occur anywhere in the CNS and presentation is variable.  Usually there is significant neurologic dysfunction associated with lethargy and vomiting.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_307"><Title>Diagnostic and Staging Evaluation</Title><Para id="_568">Diagnosis is usually readily made by either magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography scan.  MRI is preferable, as the anatomic relationship between the tumor and surrounding brain and tumor dissemination is better visualized.<Reference refidx="19"/>  </Para><Para id="_635">After diagnosis, evaluation of embryonal tumors is quite similar, essentially independent of the histologic subtype and the location of the tumor.  Given the tendency of these tumors to disseminate throughout  the CNS early in the course of illness, imaging evaluation of the neuraxis by means of MRI of the entire brain and spine is indicated.  Preferably this is done prior to surgery, in order to avoid postoperative artifacts, especially blood.  Such imaging can be difficult to interpret and must be performed in at least two planes, with and without the use of contrast enhancement (gadolinium).<Reference refidx="34"/></Para><Para id="_569">Following surgery, imaging of the primary tumor site is indicated to determine the extent of residual disease.  In addition, lumbar CSF analysis is performed, if deemed safe.  Neuroimaging and CSF evaluation are considered complementary, because as many as 10% of patients will have evidence of free-floating tumor cells in the CSF without clear evidence of leptomeningeal disease on MRI scan.<Reference refidx="35"/>  CSF analysis is conventionally done 10 to 21 days following surgery.  If CSF is obtained within 10 days of the operation, detection of tumor cells within the spinal fluid is possibly related to the surgical procedure.  In most staging systems, if fluid is obtained in the first few days following surgery and found to be positive, the positivity must be confirmed by a subsequent spinal tap to be considered of diagnostic significance.  In cases where obtainment of fluid by a lumbar spinal tap is deemed unsafe, ventricular fluid can be obtained; however, it may not to be as sensitive as lumbar fluid assessment.<Reference refidx="35"/>  </Para><Para id="_627">Because embryonal tumors are rarely metastatic to the bone, bone marrow, or other body sites at the time of diagnosis, studies such as bone marrow aspirates, chest x-rays, or bone scans are not indicated, unless there are symptoms or signs suggesting organ involvement.</Para><SummarySection id="_570"><Title>Additional diagnostic studies for patients with desmoplastic medulloblastoma</Title><Para id="_571">Patients with desmoplastic tumors with extensive nodularity should be carefully evaluated for stigmata of Gorlin syndrome.<Reference refidx="25"/>  One report observed that medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity (MBEN) was associated with Gorlin syndrome in 5 of 12 cases.<Reference refidx="25"/> Gorlin syndrome, also called nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, is an autosomal dominant disorder in which those affected are predisposed to the development of basal cell carcinomas later in life, especially in skin in the radiation portal.

Subtype 1 shows a WNT signaling gene expression signature and  beta-catenin nuclear staining. They are usually histologically classified as <Emphasis>classic</Emphasis> medulloblastoma tumors and rarely have a large cell/anaplastic appearance. They are infrequently metastasized at diagnosis. Genetically, these tumors have 6q loss and <GeneName>CTNNB1</GeneName> mutations and have activated WNT signaling; there may be occasional MYC overexpression. <Para id="_638">The WNT subset is primarily observed in older children, adolescents, and adults and does not show a male predominance. The subset is believed to have brain stem origin, from the embryonal rhombic lip region.

The tumors are believed to emanate from the external granular layer of the cerebellum. Prognosis for patients with SHH medulloblastoma appears to be negatively affected by other molecular genetic changes, such as chromosome 17p loss, chromosome 3q gain, chromothripsis, p53 amplification, <GeneName>TP53</GeneName> mutation, and the finding of large cell/anaplastic histology.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="26"/> The outcome for patients with SHH medulloblastoma is relatively favorable, primarily in children younger than 3 years  and  adults. This is likely because of the type of mutation present in the SHH pathway, given that patients with upstream mutations such as <GeneName>PTCH1</GeneName>, <GeneName>PTCH2</GeneName>, and <GeneName>SUFU</GeneName> have a more favorable prognosis than do patients with downstream mutations, such as <GeneName>GLI2</GeneName>.<Reference refidx="27"/> Overall outcome in adolescents and young adults with SHH medulloblastoma is not different from that seen in patients with non-WNT pathway–activated tumors, except for patients with <GeneName>TP53</GeneName> mutations and downstream SHH pathway mutations.
