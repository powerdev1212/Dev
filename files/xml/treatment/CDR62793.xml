trauma-related symptoms such as avoidant behaviors, intrusive thoughts, and
heightened arousal in survivors of cancer.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/>  These symptoms
resemble those seen in persons who have experienced traumatic events  
such as military combat, violent personal assault (e.g., rape), natural disasters,  or other threats to life and are
referred to collectively as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/> Acute stress disorder (ASD) is a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) condition with a profile similar to that of PTSD but a shorter time to onset, within 4 weeks of a traumatic event.  Thus the occurrence of post-traumatic stress (PTS) with trauma-related symptoms in patients with cancer has been under increasing study, influenced by changes in the diagnostic criteria for PTSD in the DSM,  fourth edition (DSM-IV).<Reference refidx="5"/>  The DSM, third revised edition (DSM-III-R),<Reference refidx="11"/> specifically excluded patients with medical illnesses such as cancer from PTSD.  The diagnostic criteria for PTSD in the DSM-IV, text revision (DSM-IV-TR), however, specifically include “being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness”  as one example of a traumatic event.<Reference refidx="12"/>  Thus,  people with histories of cancer can now be evaluated and considered at risk for PTS and related symptoms.</Para><Para id="_5"> Reviews note that PTS has been studied in a variety of cancers,  including melanoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer,  and mixed cancers.  Studies have varied, however, in assessment of patients for the full syndrome of PTSD (i.e., all DSM-IV criteria met) or only some of the PTSD-related symptoms (e.g., intrusive thoughts as measured by the Impact of Event Scale ).  Thus, incidence rates have varied accordingly. The incidence of the full syndrome of PTSD (meeting full DSM-IV diagnostic criteria) ranges from 3% to 4% in early-stage patients recently diagnosed to 35% in patients evaluated after treatment.  When incidence of PTSD-like symptoms (not meeting the full diagnostic criteria) is measured, the rates are higher, ranging from 20% in patients with early-stage cancer to 80% in those with recurrent cancer.</Para><Para id="_7">Factors suggesting which patients might be at increased risk for the development of PTS and PTSD have not been extensively studied;  however, one study of women with early-stage breast cancer <Reference refidx="13"/>   found an association with PTSD-like symptoms in patients with the following characteristics:</Para><ItemizedList id="_144" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Younger age.</ListItem><ListItem>Lower income.</ListItem><ListItem>Fewer years of formal education.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_145"> Another study of men and women treated with bone marrow transplant <Reference refidx="14"/> found that lower levels of social support and the use of avoidance coping  correlated significantly  to a higher number of PTSD-like symptoms.   One German study <Reference refidx="15"/> that evaluated patients with breast cancer for PTSD and ASD concluded that patients with lifetime PTSD (8.7%) were much more likely to experience cancer-related ASD or PTSD (odds ratio, 14.1).</Para><Para id="_49">Although no specific therapies for PTS symptoms in the cancer setting have been developed, treatment modalities used with other people with PTSD can be useful in alleviating distress in cancer patients and survivors.</Para><Para id="_1_4">In this summary, unless otherwise stated, evidence and practice issues as they relate to adults are discussed.

The incidence of the full syndrome of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (meeting the full Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition [DSM-IV], diagnostic criteria) ranges from 3% to 4% in early-stage patients recently diagnosed to 35% in patients evaluated after treatment.  When incidence of PTSD-like symptoms (not meeting the full diagnostic criteria) are measured, the rates are higher, ranging from 20% in patients with early-stage cancer to 80% in those with recurrent cancer.</Para><Para id="_107">The earliest research (predating DSM-IV) on PTS among cancer survivors concentrated on the prevalence and characteristics of the disorder in patients
who had been or were undergoing treatment,  adult and child cancer survivors, and/or  their 
family members.  A wide variety of cancer types
 was studied, including leukemia,<Reference refidx="2"/> breast cancer,
and head and neck cancers.<Reference refidx="3"/> Much of the earlier research dealt  with survivors of Hodgkin disease, probably because diagnoses at an early age and higher rates of survival resulted in  a larger population available for study.<Reference refidx="4"/>   These survivors were found to have a particularly high prevalence of intrusive thoughts and avoidance behaviors, even though they were many years posttreatment.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/>  Most of these studies    investigated PTSD-like symptoms, rather than the complete mental disorder  with all diagnostic criteria.</Para><Para id="_108"> The first study of cancer patients  utilizing the current DSM-IV diagnostic criteria  looked at  27 patients (most with breast cancer), all at least 3 years postdiagnosis and no longer receiving any cancer treatments.  In this study, a prevalence rate of 4% for current PTSD and 22% lifetime prevalence was found.<Reference refidx="8"/>  Those who met criteria for lifetime prevalence were
noted to have higher levels of general psychologic distress, suggesting that
individuals with a history of PTSD are at a substantial risk for continued
emotional difficulties.</Para><Para id="_109">Studies using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID) <Reference refidx="9"/>  found prevalence rates for PTSD between 3% and 10% in adult cancer patients. Most of these studies looked at  women with early-stage breast cancer, evaluated a few months to a few years after their cancer treatments.  Similarly, in a prospective study of 115  patients with all stages of breast cancer being treated in a comprehensive cancer center,  4% met the full diagnostic criteria for PTSD; 41% met the subsyndromal criteria for PTSD  (experiencing intense fear, helplessness, or horror after being diagnosed with cancer).  This set of subsyndromal criteria was a weak predictor of PTSD (12%) but an equally useful predictor of major depressive disorder,  global anxiety disorder, and past major depressive disorder, and it may better serve as a marker for elevated distress.<Reference refidx="10"/> In a few studies of patients with bone marrow transplants, slightly higher prevalence rates have been reported, ranging from 5% <Reference refidx="11"/> to 12% to 19% <Reference refidx="12"/>  to as high as 35%.<Reference refidx="13"/>    The range in prevalence appears to be  influenced by time of assessment (higher rates occurring with more  time since transplant) and the assessment method used.  Studies reporting lower rates typically used a self-report questionnaire,<Reference refidx="14"/>  whereas those reporting higher rates <Reference refidx="13"/> used the SCID and evaluated for symptoms at multiple times since diagnosis (i.e.,  lifetime prevalence). </Para><Para id="_125"> As an illustration of the distinction between these tools, a German study  evaluated patients with breast cancer (n = 127) for PTSD immediately postsurgery and 6 months after the first assessment.<Reference refidx="15"/>  The assessments included screening instruments  for acute stress disorder (ASD) and PTSD, such as the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and  the PTSD Checklist-Civilian (PCL-C). The first assessment also included a semistructured interview using the SCID.  On the basis of the SCID, 2.4% of participants met the criteria for mild-to-moderate cancer-related PTSD, and 2.4% were diagnosed with ASD.  However, the screening instruments IES-R and PCL-C identified PTSD in 18.5% of participants at the first assessment and in 11.2% to 16.3% of participants at the second assessment.  Authors of the study suggest that unlike SCID, the screening instruments IES-R and PCL-C measure diffuse  emotional distress and adjustment problems and not precise PTSD symptoms.  One of the main differences between symptom-based measures such as PCL-C and an actual SCID-based diagnosis  is the dysfunction caused by the symptoms.  The symptoms are rather common, but only a very small percentage of people who have the symptoms are disabled by them.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="12189252">Gurevich M, Devins GM, Rodin GM: Stress response syndromes and cancer: conceptual and assessment issues.

distressing event; however, this factor alone is not sufficient to explain the
disorder.  Not everyone exposed to a traumatic stressor develops the full-blown
syndrome (or subsets of symptoms) or qualifies for the diagnosis.  Attempts to
explain these differences and to predict who is vulnerable have focused on
psychologic (i.e., learning theory), biologic (especially hormonal), and social
(i.e., social support) factors.  Early studies of Vietnam War veterans
suggested a two-factor learning theory to account for  trauma-related
pathology.<Reference refidx="35"/><Reference refidx="36"/>  The same theory has also  been applied to 
development of PTSD in patients with cancer.<Reference refidx="37"/><Reference refidx="38"/><Reference refidx="39"/></Para><Para id="_185">PTSD symptoms develop as a function
of both classical conditioning and instrumental learning.  Classical conditioning accounts
for the fear responses elicited by various stimuli that are 
associated with the original traumatic event.  Neutral stimuli (e.g., smells, sounds,
and visual images) previously paired with the aversive stimuli (e.g.,
chemotherapy or painful procedures) eventually evoke anxiety, arousal, and fear
when presented alone, even after the trauma has ended.  Higher order
conditioning and stimulus generalization account for the exacerbation and
extension of symptoms to additional stimuli.  Once established, PTSD symptoms
are maintained through instrumental learning, that is, avoidant responses are
reinforced because avoidance of the stimuli prevents unpleasant feelings and
thoughts.</Para><Para id="_186">Estimates from epidemiologic studies suggest that on average, 
25% to  33% of individuals who are exposed to traumatic events, including cancer,
develop PTSD or subsyndromal PTSD.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="40"/>  Although the disorder appears to be a result of learning
processes, many factors have been suggested to explain why one person 
develops PTSD and another does not.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV), stipulated for the first time that being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness or learning that one’s child had such an illness qualifies as a stressful event.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_189">In 1994, the application of PTSD to patients with cancer began with the redefinition of the trauma criteria in the DSM-IV to include life-threatening illness.<Reference refidx="1"/> The essential feature of this disorder is the development of characteristic symptoms after exposure to an extreme traumatic stressor.<Reference refidx="2"/> These events elicit responses of intense fear, helplessness, or horror and trigger three clusters of PTSD symptoms. Symptoms from each of the following three clusters must be present for an individual to meet the full criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD:</Para><ItemizedList id="_190" Style="bullet" Compact="No">
     <ListItem>Re-experiencing the trauma (nightmares, flashbacks, and intrusive thoughts).</ListItem><ListItem>Persistent avoidance of reminders of the trauma (avoidance of situations, numbing of general responsiveness, and restricted range of affect). </ListItem><ListItem>Persistent increased arousal (sleep difficulties, hypervigilance, and irritability).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_191">These symptoms must last for at least 1 month and cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</Para><Para id="_192">Symptoms that last for at least 1 day but less than 1 month and that cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning might meet the diagnostic criteria for acute stress disorder (ASD). ASD is often a prodromal to PTSD.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_193"><Title>Post-traumatic Stress (PTS) and PTSD in the Cancer Setting</Title><Para id="_194">A timely and careful assessment of patients with cancer is critical to identify the
symptoms of cancer-related PTS, to note the deleterious
impact of the symptoms on functioning, and to plan interventions targeted at the most
distressing symptoms.
It is also critical  that the assessment distinguishes between the full DSM-IV PTSD syndrome (meets all required diagnostic criteria) and PTS-related symptoms only.</Para><Para id="_195">The most difficult aspect of PTS assessment in the cancer setting is the
determination of precisely when to evaluate the patient.  Diagnosis is complicated because
cancer is not an acute or discrete event, but is an experience marked by repeated
traumas and indeterminate length.  Thus, an individual may exhibit the symptoms
of PTS at any point from diagnosis through treatment, to treatment completion
and, possibly, to recurrence.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Patients such as Holocaust survivors, whose history of victimization
causes PTSD or its symptoms,  can have the symptoms activated by any number of stimuli
encountered during their treatment (e.g., clinical procedures such as being
inside magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scanners).  While 
such patients may have more difficulty in adjusting to cancer and cancer
treatment, their  symptomatology is likely to vary greatly according to their circumstances.  The relative predominance of specific PTS symptoms
may wax and wane throughout the cancer experience and beyond.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_196">The definition in the DSM-IV indicates that although PTSD symptoms usually begin within the
first 3 months after trauma, there may be a delay of months or even years
before symptoms appear.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="4"/>  These findings support the necessity for long-term monitoring of cancer survivors  and their family members.</Para><Para id="_197">At least one study found that individuals who have experienced a traumatic
event may exhibit early symptoms without meeting the full criteria for a
diagnosis of PTSD.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Nonetheless, the appearance of these early symptoms was
found to predict later development of full PTSD syndrome.  These results lend
further credence to the need for both repeated and long-term follow-up of
individuals exposed to the trauma of cancer.
(Refer to the  PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062891" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/anxiety-distress-hp-pdq">Adjustment to Cancer: Anxiety and Distress</SummaryRef> for further information.)</Para><Para id="_198">The difficulty in  properly diagnosing  PTS may be compounded by the
overlapping of PTS symptoms with those of other psychiatric disorders and by
the time-related aspects of normal adjustment.  For example, irritability, poor
concentration, hypervigilance, excessive fear, and disturbed sleep are also
symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder.  Other arousal and avoidance symptoms
are common to PTSD, phobias, and panic disorder, but loss of interest, sense of
a foreshortened future, avoidance of other people, and sleep impairment might
suggest both PTSD and depressive disorders.  Even normal reactions to the
diagnosis and treatment of life-threatening disease can consist of responses
such as:</Para><ItemizedList id="_199" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem> Intrusive thoughts.</ListItem><ListItem>Disassociation  and depersonalization.</ListItem><ListItem>Sleep
disturbances.</ListItem><ListItem>Heightened arousal.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_200">Therefore, clinicians and researchers
must be particularly attuned to the causes, duration, and severity of PTSD-like
symptoms when considering PTSD among several diagnoses.
 For instance, in a study of women with breast cancer, 41% reported experiencing “intense fear, helplessness, or horror” (DSM-IV PTSD diagnostic criterion A2); however, on further comprehensive diagnostic interview, only 4% met the full PTSD criteria.  Assessment must be able to distinguish between general psychological distress and symptoms of PTSD.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_201">The accurate diagnosis of PTSD also requires the use of reliable and valid
instruments.  Many studies have used the PTSD module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R–Nonpatient Edition (SCID-NP).<Reference refidx="7"/>     This is a clinician-administered, structured clinical interview that is time intensive and may not be feasible in settings without adequately trained mental health professionals.   However, one study <Reference refidx="8"/>  investigated the utility of a cost-effective screening tool, the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C).<Reference refidx="9"/>   In this study of 82 women diagnosed with breast cancer assessed 6 to 72 months after cancer treatment, use of the PCL-C resulted in a sensitivity of .60 and specificity of .99.  Other cutoff scores for the PCL-C that could be used were discussed, depending on the clinical resources available in specific cancer treatment settings.  
Most research studies have used the Impact of Event Scale, a self-report  of intrusive thoughts;<Reference refidx="10"/>  however,  it is important to note that this tool can help evaluate PTS symptoms but is not designed to be an assessment procedure for PTSD.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_155"><Title>Comorbidity</Title><Para id="_156">In attempting to diagnose PTSD, it is important to be aware that this disorder
is often marked by comorbid psychopathology.  Substance abuse, affective
disorders, and other anxiety disorders are consistently encountered in samples
of people with PTSD.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/>  It has been reported that war veterans with PTSD
exhibited substantial comorbid pathology that included major depression (32% to 72%), alcohol dependence (65%), drug dependence (40%), social phobia (50%), and
obsessive-compulsive disorder (10%).<Reference refidx="14"/>  High rates of concurrent disorders
have also been documented in other trauma victims.  For example, 40% to 42% of
disaster survivors with PTSD also qualified for a diagnosis of major depression,
and 20% to 42% met the criteria for concurrent generalized anxiety
disorder.<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/>  While this has not yet been studied in cancer patients or
survivors, the presence of co-occurring psychiatric disorders in Vietnam
War veterans and other trauma victims would indicate that cancer clinicians
should be alert  to identify and treat such related syndromes in
their patients.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_157"><Title>The Conceptual Fit of PTS and Cancer</Title><Para id="_158">Conceptual and practical problems can arise in the application of PTS to cancer patients and survivors. The basic concept of an extreme traumatic stressor has been described variously as an event involving direct personal experience that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury.<Reference refidx="2"/> This event can be protracted and continuous but is more frequently a single, time-limited event (e.g., rape, natural disaster).   In this context, for the person who has experienced a diagnosis of cancer, the exact nature of the trauma is   unclear.   Is it the actual diagnosis,  aspects of the treatment process,  information given about recurrence, negative test results, or  some other aspect of the cancer experience? Identifying a discrete stressor within the multiple crises that constitute a cancer experience is much more difficult  than it is for other traumas.  In one study of patients with breast cancer who underwent autologous bone marrow transplant,   more PTSD-like symptoms were reported at the time of initial diagnosis.<Reference refidx="16"/></Para><Para id="_159">Another concern regarding conceptual fit is related to re-experiencing  the trauma.  DSM-IV PTSD diagnostic criterion B requires persistent re-experiencing of the traumatic event, implying that the patient would first encounter a trauma and then, at a later time, re-experience it in various ways.  In a study of women with early-stage breast cancer, however, researchers found that the traumatizing aspects of the cancer experience were receiving the diagnosis and waiting for test results from node dissection.<Reference refidx="17"/>  Arguing that these “information traumas” are future oriented and  tend to cause intrusive worry about the future—not intrusive recollections of past events—the authors  questioned whether cancer fits a conceptual model of  PTSD trauma.   Re-experiencing  the trauma is often measured in terms of unwanted intrusive thoughts about the traumatic event.  The cognitive processing of a current and ongoing health threat with uncertain outcome might  differ significantly from  unwanted intrusive thoughts about a single past event.  Some researchers have argued that not all intrusive thoughts are negative or indicate re-experiencing a trauma; rather, they might represent appropriate vigilance and attention to potential symptoms that could result in appropriate help-seeking.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="18"/></Para><Para id="_160">Conversely,  a unique study assessing the physiological reactivity of patients with breast cancer to a personalized imagery script of their most stressful experiences with breast cancer found elevated physiologic responses that were comparable to those of PTSD patients who had experienced other (noncancer-related) traumas.  This finding suggests a good fit between  patients with cancer and the PTSD trauma model, as it shows comparable  symptoms of increased arousal in patients with cancer.  Also, in a factor analytic study  designed to confirm the presence of the three broad PTSD symptom clusters (re-experiencing, avoidance of reminders, and hyperarousal), researchers found some tentative support for the DSM-IV symptom clusters in a sample of breast cancer survivors.<Reference refidx="19"/></Para><Para id="_161">In a study of 74 women breast cancer survivors interviewed at 18 months postdiagnosis via the SCID, three groups were identified:  one meeting the full criteria for PTSD (n = 12), another meeting partial but not full criteria for PTSD (i.e., subsyndromal, n = 5), and a no-PTSD group (n = 47).  Further analyses investigated group differences.  Some notable factors affecting  the full-criteria PTSD group compared with the subsyndromal and no-PTSD groups include the following:<Reference refidx="20"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_162" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Significantly higher number of violent traumas (e.g., physical abuse, rape).</ListItem><ListItem>Higher number of anxiety disorders prior to a cancer diagnosis.</ListItem><ListItem>More advanced disease (75% stage III vs. 7% in the subsyndromal group and 6% in  the no-PTSD group).</ListItem><ListItem>More extensive surgeries (83% modified radical mastectomy vs. 47% in the subsyndromal group and 38% in the no-PTSD group).</ListItem><ListItem>Higher lifetime prevalence of previous PTSD (42% vs. 7% in the subsyndromal  group and 9% in the no-PTSD group).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_163">Further research will be needed to continue to investigate the important question of how well the conceptual model of  PTSD as an anxiety response to a major life trauma fits the life experience of patients with cancer.   Reviews have argued both in favor of <Reference refidx="21"/>   and against <Reference refidx="18"/> the continued use of trauma models for conceptualizing the experience of cancer.  Others have proposed alternate conceptual models.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="22"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: DSM-IV. 4th ed.
