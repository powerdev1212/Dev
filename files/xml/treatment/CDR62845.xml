Some patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef> pain stop getting pain relief from opioids during long-term <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044737">therapy</GlossaryTermRef>. This is called <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044739">tolerance</GlossaryTermRef>. Larger doses or a different opioid may be needed if your body stops <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044085">responding</GlossaryTermRef> to the same dose.
Tolerance of an opioid  is a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454765">physical dependence</GlossaryTermRef> on it. This is not the same as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044639">addiction</GlossaryTermRef> (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454766">psychological</GlossaryTermRef> dependence). Opioid doses can be safely increased by your doctor as needed for your pain, without causing addiction. </Para><Para id="_221">There are several types of opioids:</Para><ItemizedList id="_307" Style="bullet"><ListItem><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045400">Morphine</GlossaryTermRef> (the most commonly used opioid

schedule helps manage the pain and keeps it from getting worse.    The amount of time between doses depends on which opioid is being used.  The correct dose is the amount of opioid that controls your pain
with the fewest side effects.  The dose will be slowly adjusted until there is a good balance between
pain relief and side effects.  If opioid
tolerance does occur, it can be overcome by increasing the dose or changing to
another opioid.</Para><Para id="_119">Sometimes, the opioid dose needs to be decreased or the opioid is stopped.  This may be done when
you no longer have pain because of treatments such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044693">nerve blocks</GlossaryTermRef> or
 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044971">radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef>.

Some
examples are:<ItemizedList id="_142" Style="dash" Compact="No"><ListItem>Brief touch or massage, such as hand holding or briefly touching or
rubbing the patient's shoulders.</ListItem><ListItem>Soaking the patient's feet in warm water or wrapping the feet in a warm, wet

hands.  If the patient is modest or cannot move or turn easily in bed,
just the hands and feet can be massaged.</ListItem><ListItem>Use warm lotion.  A small bowl of hand lotion may be warmed in a
microwave oven or a bottle of lotion may be warmed in a sink of hot water
for about 10 minutes.
</ListItem><ListItem>Massage for relaxation is usually done with smooth, long, slow strokes.
Try different amounts of pressure along with different types of
massage, such as kneading and stroking, to find out what the patient likes.
<Para id="_143">Especially for the elderly person, a relaxing back rub may be no more than 3 minutes of slow, rhythmic stroking
(about 60 strokes per minute) on both sides of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000415914">spine</GlossaryTermRef>, from the crown of the
head to the lower back.  Keep one hand on the body at all times by starting one
hand down the back as the other hand stops at the lower back and is raised.

sporting events, old radio shows, or stories.)</ListItem></ItemizedList></ListItem><ListItem>Step 2. Mark time to the music; for example, tap out the rhythm with your finger or
nod your head.  This helps you think about  the music instead of  your
discomfort.</ListItem><ListItem>Step 3. Keep your eyes open and focus on a fixed spot or object.  If you wish to
close your eyes, picture something about the music.</ListItem><ListItem>Step 4. Listen to the music at a comfortable volume.  If the discomfort increases,
try increasing the volume; decrease the volume when the discomfort decreases.</ListItem><ListItem>Step 5. If the music is not helping enough, try adding or changing one or more of the
following: <ItemizedList id="_324" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Massage your body in rhythm to the music.</ListItem><ListItem>Try other music.</ListItem><ListItem>Mark
time to the music in more than one manner, such as tapping your foot and finger
at the same time.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_149">Many patients have found listening to music to be helpful.  It

During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
