The reported incidence in the United States is about 110 to 120 per 100,000 pregnancies.  The reported incidence of choriocarcinoma, the most aggressive form of GTD, in the United States is about 2 to 7 per 100,000 pregnancies.  The U.S. age-standardized (1960 World Population Standard) incidence rate of choriocarcinoma is about 0.18 per 100,000 women between the ages of 15 years and 49 years.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_381"><Title>Risk Factors</Title><Para id="_210">Two factors have consistently been associated with an increased risk of GTD:<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_211" Style="bullet"><ListItem> Maternal age.</ListItem><ListItem>History of hydatidiform mole (HM).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_212">  If a woman has been previously diagnosed with an HM, she carries a 1% risk of HM in subsequent pregnancies.  This increases to approximately 25% with more than one prior HM.  The risk associated with maternal age is bimodal, with increased risk both for mothers  younger than 20 years and older than 35 years (and particularly for mothers &gt;45 years).  Relative risks are in the range of 1.1 to 11 for both the younger and older age ranges compared with ages 20 to 35 years.  However, a population-based HM registry study suggests that the age-related patterns of the two major types of HM—complete and partial HM—are distinct.<Reference refidx="3"/> (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062901#_5" url="/types/gestational-trophoblastic/hp/gtd-treatment-pdq">Cellular Classification of Gestational Trophoblastic Disease</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information.)  In that study, the rate of complete HM was highest in women younger than 20 years and then decreased  monotonically with age.  However, the rates of partial HM increased for  the entire age spectrum, suggesting possible differences in etiology.   The association with paternal age is inconsistent.<Reference refidx="2"/>  A variety of exposures have been examined, with no clear associations found with tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, and oral contraceptive use.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_382"><Title>Clinical Features</Title><Para id="_213">GTDs contain paternal chromosomes and are placental, rather than maternal, in origin.  The most common presenting symptoms are vaginal bleeding and a rapidly enlarging uterus, and GTD should be considered whenever a premenopausal woman presents with these findings.  Because the vast majority of GTD types are associated with elevated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels, an hCG blood level and pelvic ultrasound are the initial steps in the diagnostic evaluation.  In addition to vaginal bleeding and uterine enlargement, other presenting symptoms or signs may include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_214" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Pelvic pain or sensation of pressure.</ListItem><ListItem>	Anemia. </ListItem><ListItem>	Hyperemesis gravidarum. </ListItem><ListItem>	Hyperthyroidism (secondary to the homology between the beta-subunits of hCG and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which causes hCG to have weak TSH-like activity). </ListItem><ListItem>	Preeclampsia early in pregnancy. </ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_3">The most common antecedent pregnancy in GTD is that of an HM. </Para><Para id="_4">Choriocarcinoma most commonly follows a molar pregnancy but can follow a
normal pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, or abortion, and it should always be
considered when a patient has continued vaginal bleeding in the postdelivery
period.  Other possible signs include neurologic symptoms (resulting from  brain metastases) in a female
within the reproductive age group and asymptomatic lesions on routine chest
x-ray.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_383"><Title>Prognostic Factors and Survivorship</Title><Para id="_215">The prognosis for cure
of patients with GTDs is good even when the disease has spread to distant
organs, especially when only the lungs are involved.  Therefore, the traditional TNM staging system has limited prognostic value.<Reference refidx="4"/>  The probability of cure
depends on the following: </Para><ItemizedList id="_216" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Histologic type (invasive mole or choriocarcinoma).</ListItem><ListItem>Extent of spread of the disease/largest  tumor size.

on these factors plus the patient’s desire for future pregnancies.  The beta-hCG is a sensitive marker to indicate the presence or absence of disease before,
during, and after treatment. Given the extremely good therapeutic outcomes of most of these tumors, an important goal is to distinguish patients who need less-intensive therapies from those who require more-intensive regimens to achieve a cure.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="22999504">Ngan HY, Kohorn EI, Cole LA, et al.: Trophoblastic disease.

Choriocarcinoma, PSTT, and ETT are often grouped under the heading gestational trophoblastic tumors.
</Para><SummarySection id="_282"><Title>HM</Title><Para id="_283">HM is defined as products of conception that show gross cyst-like swellings of the chorionic villi that are caused by an 
accumulation of fluid.  There is disintegration and loss of blood vessels in
the villous core.
</Para><SummarySection id="_284"><Title>Complete HM</Title><Para id="_285">A complete mole occurs when an ovum that has extruded its maternal nucleus is fertilized by either a single sperm, with subsequent chromosome duplication, or two sperm, resulting in either case in a diploid karyotype.  The former case always yields a mole with a karyotype of 46 XX, since at least one X chromosome is required for viability and a karyotype of 46 YY is rapidly lethal to the ovum.  The latter case may yield a karyotype of 46 XX or 46 XY. About 90% of complete HMs are 46 XX.  On ultrasound examination, complete moles rarely reveal a fetus or amniotic fluid.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_286"><Title>Partial HM</Title><Para id="_287">A partial mole occurs when the ovum retains its nucleus but is fertilized by a single sperm, with subsequent chromosome duplication, or is fertilized by two sperm; the possible resulting triploid karyotypes are 69 XXY, 69 XXX, or 69 XYY.  Therefore, in contrast to a complete mole, the partial mole chromosomes of a partial mole are only two-thirds paternal in origin.  In contrast to complete moles, partial moles usually show a fetus, which may even be viable, and amniotic fluid is visible.</Para><Para id="_288">Complete HMs have a 15% to 25% risk of developing into an invasive mole, but transformation to malignancy is much more rare (&lt;5%) in the case of partial moles.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_315"><Title>Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasias</Title><SummarySection id="_338"><Title>Invasive mole</Title><Para id="_339">Invasive moles (chorioadenoma destruens) are locally invasive, rarely
metastatic lesions characterized microscopically by trophoblastic invasion of
the myometrium with identifiable villous structures.  These may be preceded by either complete or partial molar pregnancy. They are usually diploid in karyotype, but may be aneuploid. Microscopically, these
lesions are characterized by hyperplasia of cytotrophoblastic and syncytial
elements and persistence of villous structures. They may resemble choriocarcinoma in histologic appearance.  Invasive moles have more aggressive behavior than either complete or partial HMs, and they are treated similarly to choriocarcinoma (i.e., with chemotherapy).  However, unlike choriocarcinoma, they may regress spontaneously.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_292"><Title>Choriocarcinoma</Title><Para id="_293">Choriocarcinoma is a malignant tumor of the trophoblastic epithelium. Uterine
muscle and blood vessels are invaded with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. 
Columns and sheets of trophoblastic tissue invade normal tissues and spread to
distant sites, the most common of which are lungs, brain, liver, pelvis,
vagina, spleen, intestines, and kidney.
Most choriocarcinomas have an aneuploid karyotype, and about three-quarters of them contain a Y chromosome.  Most follow an HM pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, or ectopic pregnancy; but, about one-quarter of them are preceded by a full-term pregnancy.  Nearly all GTDs that are preceded by nonmolar pregnancies are choriocarcinomas; the rare exceptions generally are PSTTs. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_294"><Title>PSTT</Title><Para id="_295">PSTT disease is the result of a very rare tumor arising from
the placental implantation site and resembles an exaggerated form of syncytial
endometritis.  Trophoblastic cells infiltrate the myometrium, and there is
vascular invasion.  Human placental lactogen is present in the tumor cells,
whereas immunoperoxidase staining for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is positive in only scattered cells,
and elevations in serum hCG are relatively low compared with the marked elevations seen in choriocarcinoma.  hCG is not a reliable marker of tumor volume.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/> PSTTs have much lower growth rates than choriocarcinoma, and presentation after a full-term pregnancy is often delayed by months or years.  They are generally resistant to chemotherapy.  Therefore, hysterectomy is the standard primary treatment if the tumor is confined to the uterus.  However, about 35% of PSTTs have distant metastases at diagnosis.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> Common sites of metastasis include the lungs, pelvis, and lymph nodes. Central nervous system, renal, and liver metastases have also been observed. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_296"><Title>ETT</Title><Para id="_300">ETT is an extremely rare gestational trophoblastic tumor.<Reference refidx="5"/> <Reference refidx="6"/>   Although originally termed <Emphasis>atypical choriocarcinoma</Emphasis>, it appears to be less aggressive than choriocarcinoma and is now regarded as a distinct entity.  Pathologically, it has a monomorphic cellular pattern of epithelioid cells and may resemble squamous cell cancer of the cervix when arising in the cervical canal.  Its clinical behavior appears to be closer to that of PSTT than to choriocarcinoma.  It has a spectrum of clinical behavior from benign to malignant.  About one-third of patients present with metastases, usually in the lungs.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="14602247">Altieri A, Franceschi S, Ferlay J, et al.: Epidemiology and aetiology of gestational trophoblastic diseases.

However, since they carry a risk of persistence or progression to malignant gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD), they must be followed carefully with weekly serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels to  normalization. Monthly follow-up for 6 months is generally recommended, although the duration of this phase of follow-up is not based on empiric study.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_228">Prompt institution of therapy for GTD and continuing follow-up at very close intervals until normal beta-hCG  titers are obtained is the cornerstone of management. When chemotherapy is instituted, the interval between courses should rarely exceed 14 to 21 days, depending on the regimen used. It is recommended that patients receive one to three courses of chemotherapy after the first normal beta-hCG titer, depending on the extent of disease. The modified World Health Organization (WHO) Prognostic Scoring System (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062901#_325" url="/types/gestational-trophoblastic/hp/gtd-treatment-pdq">Table 1</SummaryRef>) should be utilized, and combination chemotherapy should be initiated when warranted by the patient's score.

</Para><SummarySection id="_323"><Title>False-positive hCG</Title><Para id="_307">Serum hCG testing relies on detecting two antibodies on the hCG molecule.  The antibodies are polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies derived from various animals: mouse, rabbit, goat or sheep.  Humans with heterophilic (or cross-species) antibodies bind the antibodies in the assay, leading to a false-positive result.  This was a common problem with one of the commercially available assays until it was re-engineered in 2003.  Heterophilic antibodies cannot cross the glomerular filtration barrier, so the performance of a urinary hCG can eliminate this source for a positive test result.  The urine sample should be run using the same system generally reserved for serum, as opposed to over-the-counter urine-pregnancy tests, to avoid decreased sensitivity in the latter.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_324"><Title>Pituitary hCG</Title><Para id="_309">The anterior stalk of the pituitary secretes luteinizing hormone (LH), which shares an alpha subunit with hCG.

A patient whose disease progresses after primary surgical therapy is generally treated with single-agent chemotherapy unless one of the poor-prognosis factors that requires combination chemotherapy supervenes.  Relapse after failure of prior chemotherapy automatically places the patient in the
high-risk category.  These patients should be treated with
aggressive chemotherapy.
