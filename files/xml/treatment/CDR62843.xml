Between 1975 and 2010, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close follow-up because cancer therapy side effects may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  (Refer to the PDQ summary <SummaryRef href="CDR0000343584" url="/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq">Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer</SummaryRef>  for specific information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors.)</Para><Para id="_3">Primary brain tumors are a diverse group of diseases that together constitute the most common solid tumor of childhood. Immunohistochemical analysis, cytogenetic and molecular genetic findings, and measures of mitotic activity are increasingly used in tumor diagnosis and classification. Brain tumors are classified according to histology, but tumor location and extent of spread are important factors that affect treatment and prognosis.</Para><Para id="_381">Ependymomas arise from ependymal cells that line the ventricles and passageways in the brain and the center of the spinal cord. Ependymal cells produce cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These tumors are classified as supratentorial or infratentorial. In children, most ependymomas are infratentorial tumors that arise in or around the fourth ventricle. According to the WHO classification of brain tumors, ependymal tumors are classified into the following four main subtypes:</Para><ItemizedList id="_382" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Subependymoma (WHO Grade I).</ListItem><ListItem>Myxopapillary ependymoma (WHO Grade I).</ListItem><ListItem>Ependymoma (WHO Grade II).</ListItem><ListItem>Anaplastic ependymoma (WHO Grade III).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_383">The location of the tumor determines the clinical presentation.
