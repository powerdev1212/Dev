From 2004 to 2008, the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044941">median</GlossaryTermRef> age of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046450">diagnosis</GlossaryTermRef> of prostate cancer was 67, and the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046145">incidence</GlossaryTermRef> rate was 156 cases per 100,000 men per year.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_50">Many studies suggest that CAM use is common among prostate cancer patients, and the use of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044744">vitamins</GlossaryTermRef>, supplements, and specific foods is frequently reported by these patients.  For example, the Prostate CAncer Therapy Selection (PCATS) study was a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044079">prospective</GlossaryTermRef> study that investigated men’s decision-making processes about treatment following a diagnosis of local <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045885">stage</GlossaryTermRef> prostate cancer. As part of this study, patients completed surveys regarding CAM use, and more than half of the respondents reported using one or more CAM therapies, with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000729732">mind-body modalities</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044510">biologically</GlossaryTermRef> based treatments being the most commonly used.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_51">International studies have reported similar findings. A Swedish study published in 2011 found that, overall, participants with prostate cancer were more likely to have used supplements than were healthy population-based <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044149">control subjects</GlossaryTermRef>. Supplement use was even more common among patients with the healthiest dietary patterns (e.g., high consumption of fatty fish and vegetables).<Reference refidx="3"/>  In a Canadian study, CAM use was reported among 39% of recently diagnosed prostate cancer patients, and the most commonly used forms of CAM were <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463714">herbals</GlossaryTermRef>, vitamins, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045787">minerals</GlossaryTermRef>. Within those categories, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000514413">saw palmetto</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045023">vitamin E</GlossaryTermRef>, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045113">selenium</GlossaryTermRef> were the most popular. The two most popular reasons for choosing CAM  were to boost the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356">immune system</GlossaryTermRef> and to prevent <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045861">recurrence</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="4"/>  According to another Canadian study, approximately 30% of survey respondents with prostate cancer reported using CAM treatments. In that study,  vitamin E, saw palmetto, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044909">lycopene</GlossaryTermRef> were most commonly used.<Reference refidx="5"/>     A British study published in 2008 indicated that 25% of prostate cancer patients used CAM, with the most frequently reported interventions being low-fat <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044660">diets</GlossaryTermRef>, vitamins, and lycopene. The majority of CAM users in this study cited improving <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef> and boosting the immune system as the main reasons they used CAM.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_52">Vitamin and supplement use has also been documented in men at risk of developing prostate cancer. One study examined vitamin and supplement use in men with a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000302456">family history</GlossaryTermRef> of prostate cancer. At the time of the survey, almost 60% of the men were using vitamins or supplements. One third of the men were using vitamins and supplements that were specifically marketed for prostate health or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045487">chemoprevention</GlossaryTermRef> (e.g., selenium, green tea, and saw palmetto).<Reference refidx="7"/> A 2004 study examined herbal and vitamin supplement use in men who attended a prostate cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046171">screening</GlossaryTermRef> clinic. Men who attended the screening clinic completed questionnaires about supplement use. Of the respondents, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000390238">analysis</GlossaryTermRef> revealed that a reported 70% used multivitamins, and 21% used herbal supplements.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_53">A <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000691484">meta-analysis</GlossaryTermRef> published in 2008 reviewed studies that reported vitamin and mineral supplement use among cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000450125">survivors</GlossaryTermRef>. The results showed that, among prostate cancer survivors, vitamin or mineral use ranged from 26% to 35%.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_54">Although many prostate cancer patients use CAM treatments, they do not all disclose their CAM use to treating physicians. According to results from the PCATS study, 43% of patients discussed their CAM use with a healthcare professional.<Reference refidx="2"/>  In two separate studies, 58% of respondents told their doctors about their CAM usage.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_55">How do prostate cancer patients decide whether to use CAM or not? A qualitative study published in 2005 described results from interviews with prostate cancer patients who were CAM users or nonusers. The study identified differences in thinking patterns between the two groups and suggested that no specific theme led patients to CAM, rather a combination of ideas directed them. For example, the perception of CAM being harmless was associated with the belief that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449752">conventional medicine</GlossaryTermRef> resulted in many negative <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046580">side effects</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="10"/>  Results of a 2003 qualitative study suggest that decision making by prostate cancer patients about CAM treatments depends on both fixed (e.g., medical history) and flexible (e.g., a need to feel in control) decision factors.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_577">Many of the medical and scientific terms used in this summary are hypertext linked (at first use in each section) to the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/">NCI Dictionary                   of Cancer Terms</ExternalRef>, which is oriented toward nonexperts.

Calcium is required for vascular contraction and vasodilation, muscle function, nerve transmission, intracellular signaling, and hormonal secretion, although less than 1% of total body calcium is needed to support these critical metabolic functions.<Reference refidx="1"/> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044088">Serum</GlossaryTermRef> calcium is very tightly regulated and does not fluctuate with changes in dietary intake; the body uses bone <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissue</GlossaryTermRef> as a reservoir for, and source of calcium to maintain constant concentrations of calcium in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000270735">blood</GlossaryTermRef>, muscle, and intercellular <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044669">fluids</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="1"/> </Para><Para id="_534">The major sources of calcium in the U.S. population are food and dietary supplements.<Reference refidx="2"/> According to recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey  data, U.S. adults obtain 38% of their dietary calcium from milk and milk products, such as yogurt and cheese.<Reference refidx="3"/> Nondairy sources include vegetables, such as Chinese cabbage, kale, and broccoli. Spinach provides calcium, but its <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044225">bioavailability</GlossaryTermRef> is poor. Most grains do not have high amounts of calcium unless they are fortified; however, they contribute calcium to the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044660">diet</GlossaryTermRef> because they contain small amounts of calcium, and people consume them frequently. Foods fortified with calcium include many fruit juices and drinks, tofu, and cereals.  In the United States, dietary supplements, including calcium supplements, are commonly used to prevent <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045641">chronic</GlossaryTermRef> diseases, including <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="1"/>  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000285973">Mean</GlossaryTermRef> dietary calcium intakes for males aged 1 year and older ranged from 871 to 1,266 mg/day depending on life stage group (i.e., infant, adolescent, or adult).

Ch'a is the Mandarin word for “tea.” In the dialect spoken in the southern Chinese province of Fujian, the word for “tea” was pronounced “tay.” This term was borrowed by European traders who bought tea at the southern Chinese ports, and it evolved into tea (English), thé (French), and Tee (German). “Tea” is also used to describe <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045738">infusions</GlossaryTermRef> of medicinal <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463714">herbs</GlossaryTermRef>, such as sage and calamint.<Reference refidx="3"/> In this PDQ information summary, “tea” refers to the leaves of the <Emphasis>C. sinensis</Emphasis> plant or the beverage brewed from those leaves.</Para><Para id="_180">Some observational and interventional studies suggest that green tea may have a protective effect against cardiovascular disease,<Reference refidx="4"/> and there is evidence that green tea may protect against various forms of cancer.<Reference refidx="5"/> Many of the health benefits associated with tea have been attributed to polyphenols.

For example, in one study, prostate cancer cells treated with EGCG (concentrations, 0–80 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000659790">μM</GlossaryTermRef>) demonstrated suppressed cell proliferation and decreased levels of PSA <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046092">protein</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000662001">mRNA</GlossaryTermRef> in the presence or absence of androgen.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_188">In a 2011 study, human prostate cancer cells were treated initially with EGCG (concentrations,  1.5–7.5 μM) and then with radiation.

To further examine the effect of EGCG on the ERK 1/2 pathway, cells were treated with EGCG (0–50 μM) and a mitogen-activated protein <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000641114">kinase</GlossaryTermRef> (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000600473">MEK</GlossaryTermRef>) inhibitor or phosphoinositide-3 kinase (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000530323">PI3K</GlossaryTermRef>) inhibitor. Inhibition of MEK did not prevent ERK 1/2 upregulation, although the increase in ERK 1/2 after EGCG treatment was partially inhibited with the PI3K inhibitor. These findings suggest that EGCG may prevent prostate cancer cell proliferation by increasing the activity of ERK 1/2 via a MEK-independent, PI3K-dependent mechanism.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_190">According to a 2010 study, EGCG treatment (20–120 μM) resulted in changes in expression levels of 40 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045693">genes</GlossaryTermRef> in prostate cancer cells, including a fourfold downregulation of inhibitor of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045671">DNA</GlossaryTermRef> binding 2 (ID2; a protein involved in cell proliferation and survival). In addition, forced expression of ID2 in cells treated with 80 μM EGCG resulted in reduced apoptosis, suggesting that EGCG may cause cell death via an ID2-related mechanism.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_191">Advances in nanotechnology—“nanochemoprevention”—may result in more effective <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000478733">administration</GlossaryTermRef> of EGCG to men at risk of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer cells were treated with EGCG-loaded (100 μM EGCG) nanoparticles or free EGCG. Although both treatments decreased cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000653131">nanoparticle</GlossaryTermRef> treatment had a greater effect at a lower <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000683342">concentration</GlossaryTermRef> than did free EGCG.

Increased <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000655031">methylation</GlossaryTermRef> leads to silencing of the gene. A set of experiments investigated the effects of green tea polyphenols on GSTP1 expression. Treatment of different types of prostate cancer cells with green tea polyphenols (1–10 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000306521">μg</GlossaryTermRef>/<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000655103">mL</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000350240">Polyphenon E</GlossaryTermRef>) resulted in re-expression of GSTP1 by reversing hypermethylation and by reducing expression of methyl-CpG binding <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460145">domain</GlossaryTermRef> (MBD) proteins, which bind to methylated DNA. These results indicate that green tea polyphenols may have chemopreventive effects via actions on gene-silencing processes.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para><Para id="_193">The results of a 2011 study suggested that green tea polyphenols may exert anticancer effects by inhibiting <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000318814">histone</GlossaryTermRef> deacetylases (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000586370">HDAC</GlossaryTermRef>). Class I HDACs are often overexpressed in various cancers, including prostate cancer.

Studies in humans have indicated that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000270735">blood</GlossaryTermRef> levels of EGCG are 0.1 to 0.6 µM after consumption of two to three cups of green tea and that drinking seven to nine cups of green tea results in EGCG blood levels still lower than 1 μM.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/> A 1 μM solution of EGCG would contain 0.458 μg of EGCG per mL.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_195"><Title>Animal  studies</Title><Para id="_196"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043996">Animal models</GlossaryTermRef> have been used in numerous studies investigating the effects of green tea on prostate cancer. In one study, TRAMP mice were given access to water or green tea catechin-treated water (0.3% green tea catechin solution; this exposure mimics  human consumption of 6 cups of green tea daily). After 24 weeks, water-fed TRAMP mice had developed prostate cancer whereas mice treated with green tea catechins showed only PIN <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046324">lesions</GlossaryTermRef>, suggesting that green tea catechins may help delay the development of prostate  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumors</GlossaryTermRef>. Furthermore, the results showed that mice treated with green tea catechins had lower prostate <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissue</GlossaryTermRef> levels of MCM7 (a protein that is important in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000597136">DNA replication</GlossaryTermRef> and that is up-regulated during cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044078">progression</GlossaryTermRef>) than mice treated with water, suggesting that green tea may delay prostate cancer progression by inhibiting MCM7 expression.<Reference refidx="17"/> In another study, castrated mice were <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044678">injected</GlossaryTermRef> with prostate cancer cells and then treated daily with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046339">intraperitoneal</GlossaryTermRef> injections of 1 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044213">mg</GlossaryTermRef> EGCG or vehicle. Treatment with EGCG resulted in reductions in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000467873">tumor volume</GlossaryTermRef> and decreases in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044088">serum</GlossaryTermRef> PSA levels compared to vehicle treatment. These results provide a rationale for the exploration of EGCG treatment in patients with advanced prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_197">In a 2011 study, EGCG was shown to be an androgen antagonist; when added to prostate cancer cells, EGCG physically interacted with the androgen receptor’s ligand-binding domain. In addition, mice <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000285636">implanted</GlossaryTermRef> with tumor cells and treated with EGCG (intraperitoneal injections of 1 mg EGCG, 3/week) exhibited less androgen receptor <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000557359">protein expression</GlossaryTermRef> than did mice that were treated with vehicle. These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of green tea may be a result of EGCG’s inhibitory actions on the androgen receptor, and, because androgen receptor signaling is generally intact in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000686077">hormone-refractory</GlossaryTermRef> and hormone-sensitive prostate cancer,  green tea has the potential to be useful in both forms of the disease.<Reference refidx="18"/></Para><Para id="_198">The age at which green tea consumption begins may determine how effective it is in  prostate cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000439419">prevention</GlossaryTermRef>. In a 2009 study, TRAMP mice were started on a green tea polyphenol intervention (0.1% green tea polyphenols in drinking water) at various ages (meant to represent different <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045885">stages</GlossaryTermRef> of prostate cancer development).<Reference refidx="19"/> The results showed that, although all of the green tea–fed mice exhibited longer tumor-free survival than did water-fed control mice, there was an advantage for the mice that were fed with green tea the longest. These findings suggest that green tea may be most beneficial in men <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046450">diagnosed</GlossaryTermRef> with early prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions, men who are at high risk of developing prostate cancer, or men who are undergoing <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045942">watchful waiting</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="19"/> In one study, EGCG treatment (0.06% EGCG in drinking water; this exposure mimics human consumption of 6 cups of green tea daily) was initiated in TRAMP mice at age 12 or 28 weeks. EGCG treatment suppressed HGPIN in mice treated at age 12 weeks; however, EGCG did not prevent prostate cancer development in mice that began treatment at age 28 weeks.<Reference refidx="20"/> In a third study, TRAMP and wild-type mice were administered green tea polyphenols in drinking water (0.05% green tea polyphenols in drinking water) starting at 4 weeks or 25 weeks after weaning. Consumption of GTP did not affect prostate pathology, but there were <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045921">systemic</GlossaryTermRef> effects.

These findings suggest that age and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044056">metabolic</GlossaryTermRef> capacity may influence the chemopreventive effects of green tea polyphenols.<Reference refidx="21"/> Using the TRAMP mice model,<Reference refidx="22"/>  one study  demonstrated that oral infusion of GTP extract at a human-achievable dose (equivalent to 6 cups of green tea per day) significantly delayed primary tumor incidence and tumor burden, as assessed sequentially by magnetic resonance imaging,   decreased prostate weight (64% of baseline) and genitourinary weight (72%), inhibited serum <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000653119">insulin-like growth factor</GlossaryTermRef>-1 (IGF-I), restored insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) levels, and produced marked reduction in the protein expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen  in the GTP-fed TRAMP mice, compared with water-fed TRAMP mice. Furthermore, GTP consumption caused significant apoptosis, which possibly resulted in reduced dissemination of cancer cells, thereby causing inhibition of development, progression, and metastasis to distant organ sites.</Para><Para id="_257">These disparate observations in preclinical trials may be attributed to the pharmacokinetic properties of the individual catechin (i.e., EGCG vs. whole green tea polyphenols). Compared with green tea polyphenols, EGCG has relatively low oral bioavailability, possibly because of slow absorption and high metabolic clearance by the liver.<Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/>   Other potential confounders may include dosage, method of infusion, duration of intervention, and timing of castration, all of which may influence the markers of progression and the antioxidant property of EGCG.

An <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000390238">analysis</GlossaryTermRef> of prostate tissue obtained from the green tea drinkers revealed that both methylated and nonmethylated forms of EGCG are found in the prostate following a short-term treatment with green tea, with 48% of EGCG in the methylated form. Methylated forms of EGCG are not as effective as EGCG in inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, suggesting that methylation status of EGCG may affect the chemopreventive properties of green tea.

In four phase I, single-dose and multidose studies that targeted healthy volunteers who took a botanical drug substance containing a mixture of catechins,  Polyphenon E containing  a dose range of 200 to 1,200 mg EGCG was well tolerated.<Reference refidx="44"/><Reference refidx="45"/><Reference refidx="46"/><Reference refidx="47"/>  Adverse effects  have generally been mild, with no serious adverse events reported. Adverse effects reported with a possible relationship to the study drug included asthenia, headache, abdominal pain, chest pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, eructation, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, vasodilation, and rash. No grade 3 or higher events were reported with a possible relationship to the study drug. Grade 2 events reported with a possible relationship to the study drug included asthenia, headache, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, nausea, and rash. The most frequent events in completed studies that at times were considered drug-related included headache, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, dizziness, and asthenia.<Reference refidx="44"/>  Gastrointestinal adverse effects were usually mild, seen most often in the fasting condition and at the highest dose level. Onset of gastrointestinal events typically occurred within 2 to 3 hours of dosing and resolved within 2 hours. Headaches and fatigue were not dose-related and may have been related to abstinence from caffeine or other procedure-related stresses.</Para><Para id="_560">In recent years, oral consumption of varying doses and compositions of green tea extracts (GTEs) has been associated with several instances of hepatotoxicity.<Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="48"/><Reference refidx="49"/><Reference refidx="50"/>  Most affected patients were women, and many were consuming GTEs for the purpose of weight loss. Although hepatotoxicity in most cases resolved within 4 months of stopping GTE, there have been cases of positive rechallenge and liver failure requiring liver transplantation. One   report described a case of acute liver failure that required transplantation in a woman who consumed green tea extract capsules.<Reference refidx="49"/> The capsules contained Polyphenon 70A and  120 mg green tea extract. Because no other causal relationship could be identified, the treating physicians concluded that the fulminant liver failure experienced by this patient was most likely related to the consumption of over-the-counter GTE weight-loss supplements. In addition, the sale of an ethanolic GTE sold as a weight-reduction aid was suspended  in 2003 after reports associated hepatotoxicity (four cases in Spain and nine cases in France) with its use.<Reference refidx="50"/> Time to onset of hepatotoxicity following ingestion of GTEs ranged from several days to several months. Increased oral bioavailability occurs when GTEs are administered on an empty stomach after an overnight fast. Increased toxicity, including hepatotoxicity, is observed when Polyphenon E or EGCG is administered to fasted dogs.<Reference refidx="27"/> Therefore, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Division of Drug Oncology Products has recommended that Polyphenon E be taken with food by subjects participating in clinical studies.

Plasma lycopene levels rose and appeared to plateau by 3 months for all doses.

Treating cells with EGCG, kaempferol, and punicic acid further resulted in apoptosis, with punicic acid (the primary constituent of pomegranate seeds) being the strongest inducer of apoptosis. Additionally, findings from this study suggest that punicic acid may activate apoptosis by a caspase-dependent pathway.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_91">Pomegranate extracts have also been shown to inhibit the proliferation of human prostate cancer cells <Emphasis>in vitro</Emphasis>.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/>   In one study, three  prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, LNCaP-AR, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000390267">DU-145</GlossaryTermRef>) were treated with pomegranate polyphenols [punicalagin (PA) or ellagic acid (EA)], a pomegranate extract (POMx, which contains EA and PA), or pomegranate juice (PJ, which contains PA, EA, and anthocyanins) in concentrations ranging from 3.125 to 50 µg/mL (standardized to PA content).

However, PJ and POMx were stronger inhibitors of cell growth than were PA and EA. In this study, the effects of PA, EA, POMx, and PJ on the expression of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045592">androgen</GlossaryTermRef>-synthesizing enzyme <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045693">genes</GlossaryTermRef> and the androgen <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044958">receptor</GlossaryTermRef> were also measured. Although statistically significant decreases in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000537335">gene expression</GlossaryTermRef> occurred in LNCaP cells following treatment with POMx and in DU-145 cells following treatment with EA and POMx, significant decreases in gene expression and androgen receptor occurred in LNCaP-AR cells following all of the treatments.<Reference refidx="10"/>   In a second study, treating PC3 cells (human prostate cancer cells with a high <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044058">metastatic</GlossaryTermRef> potential) with POMx (10-100 µg/mL) resulted in cell growth inhibition and apoptosis, both in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment of CWR22Rv1 cells (prostate cancer cells that express the androgen receptor and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000643082">secrete</GlossaryTermRef> PSA) with POMx (10-100 µg/mL concentrations of pomegranate fruit extract) led to the inhibition of cell growth, a dose-dependent decrease in androgen receptor <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000557359">protein expression</GlossaryTermRef>, and dose-dependent reductions in PSA protein levels.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para><Para id="_92">The enzyme cytochrome P450 (CYP1B1) has been implicated in cancer development and progression. As a result, CYP1B1 inhibitors may be effective anti-carcinogenic targets. In a study reported in 2009, the effects of pomegranate metabolites on CYP1B1 activation and expression in CWR22Rv1 prostate cancer cells were examined. In this study, urolithins A and B inhibited CYP1B1 expression and activity.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para><Para id="_93">In addition, the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system has been implicated in prostate cancer. A   study reported in 2010 examined the effects of a POMx on the IGF system. Treating LAPC4 prostate cancer cells with POMx (10 µg/mL concentration of pomegranate extract prepared from skin and arils minus seeds) resulted in cell growth inhibition and apoptosis, but treating the cells with both reagents led to larger effects on growth inhibition and apoptosis. However, these substances may have induced apoptosis by different mechanisms.

In addition, CWR22Rv1 cells treated with POMx (1 and 10 µg/mL) exhibited a dose-dependent reduction in IGF1 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000662001">mRNA</GlossaryTermRef> levels, but treatment with IGFBP-3 or IGF-1 did not alter levels of IGF1; these results suggest that one way POMx decreases prostate cancer cell survival is by inhibiting IGF1 expression.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_94">In a  study reported in 2011, human <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045713">hormone</GlossaryTermRef>-independent prostate cancer cells (DU145 and PC3 cell lines) were treated with 1% or 5% PJ for times ranging from 12 to 72 hours. The results showed that treatment with PJ increased adhesion and decreased the migration of prostate cancer cells. Molecular analyses revealed that PJ increased the expression of cell-adhesion related genes and inhibited the expression of genes involved in cytoskeletal function and cellular migration. These findings suggest that PJ may be beneficial in slowing down or preventing cancer cell metastasis.<Reference refidx="15"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_95"><Title>Animal studies</Title><Para id="_96">The effects of pomegranate on prostate cancer have been examined using a number of rodent models of the disease.

A link between isoflavones and cancer was discovered in 1987 when it was shown that genistein inhibited a protein tyrosine kinase that is often <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045812">overexpressed</GlossaryTermRef> in cancer cells.<Reference refidx="7"/>  Subsequently, genistein was found to inhibit multiple protein tyrosine kinases relevant to cancer cell proliferation.<Reference refidx="8"/>   In addition, numerous studies have shown that prostate cancer incidence is very low in Asian countries, where diets tend to be high in soy.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_110"><Title>Preclinical/Animal Studies</Title><SummarySection id="_173"><Title><Emphasis>In vitro</Emphasis> studies</Title><SummarySection id="_112"><Title>Individual isoflavones</Title><Para id="_113">A number of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044512">laboratory studies</GlossaryTermRef> have examined ways in which soy components affect prostate cancer cells. In one study, human prostate cancer cells and normal prostate <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045682">epithelial</GlossaryTermRef> cells were treated with either an ethanol vehicle (carrier) or isoflavones. Treatment with genistein decreased COX-2 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000662001">mRNA</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046092">protein</GlossaryTermRef> levels in cancer cells and normal epithelial cells more than did treatment with the vehicle. In addition, cells treated with genistein exhibited reduced <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000643082">secretion</GlossaryTermRef> of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and reduced mRNA levels of the prostaglandin <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044958">receptors</GlossaryTermRef> EP4 and FP, suggesting that genistein may exert <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045487">chemopreventive</GlossaryTermRef> effects by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, which promote <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044042">inflammation</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="10"/>  In another study, human prostate cancer cells were treated with genistein or daidzein.

However, during the 72 hours of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045734">incubation</GlossaryTermRef>, only genistein provoked effects on the dynamic <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460203">phenotype</GlossaryTermRef> and decreased invasiveness in PC-3 cells. These results imply that invasive activity is at least partially dependent on <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046294">membrane</GlossaryTermRef> fluidity and that genistein may exert its antimetastatic effects by changing the mechanical properties of prostate cancer cells. No such effects were observed for daidzein at the same dose.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_114"><Title>Combinations of isoflavones</Title><Para id="_115">Some experiments have been conducted comparing effects of individual isoflavones with isoflavone combinations on prostate cancer cells. In one such study, human prostate cancer cells were treated with a soy <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000407760">extract</GlossaryTermRef> (containing genistin, daidzin, and glycitin), genistein, or daidzein. The soy <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000407760">extract</GlossaryTermRef> induced <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000597111">cell cycle</GlossaryTermRef> arrest and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046524">apoptosis</GlossaryTermRef> in prostate cancer cells to a greater degree  than did treatment with the individual isoflavones. Genistein and daidzein activated apoptosis in noncancerous <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046509">benign prostatic hyperplasia</GlossaryTermRef> (BPH) cells, but the soy extract had no effect on those cells. These findings suggest that products  containing a combination of active <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000422394">compounds</GlossaryTermRef> (e.g., "whole foods") may be more effective in preventing cancer than individual compounds.<Reference refidx="13"/>  Similarly, in another study, prostate cancer cells were treated with genistein, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044148">biochanin A</GlossaryTermRef>, quercetin, doublets of those compounds (e.g., genistein + quercetin), or with all three compounds. All of the treatments resulted in decreased cell proliferation, but the greatest reductions occurred using the combination of genistein, biochanin A, and quercetin. The triple combination treatment induced more apoptosis in prostate cancer cells than did individual or doublet compound treatments. These results indicate that combining phytoestrogens may increase the effectiveness of the individual compounds.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para><Para id="_116">At least one study has examined the combined effect of soy isoflavones and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046049">curcumin</GlossaryTermRef>.  Human prostate cancer cells were treated with isoflavones, curcumin, or a combination of the two. Curcumin and isoflavones in combination were more effective in lowering PSA levels and expression of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045592">androgen</GlossaryTermRef> receptor than were curcumin or the isoflavones individually.<Reference refidx="15"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_117"><Title>Animal studies</Title><Para id="_118"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043996">Animal models</GlossaryTermRef> of prostate cancer have been used in studies investigating the effects of soy and isoflavones on the disease. Wild-type and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000691466">transgenic</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046216">adenocarcinoma</GlossaryTermRef> of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice were fed control diets or diets containing genistein (250 mg genistein/kg chow). The TRAMP mice fed with genistein exhibited reduced cell proliferation in the prostate compared with TRAMP mice fed a control diet. The genistein-supplemented diet also reduced levels of ERK-1 and ERK-2 (proteins important in stimulating cell proliferation) as well as the growth factor receptors EGFR and IGF-1R in TRAMP mice, suggesting that down regulation of these proteins may be one mechanism by which genistein exerts chemopreventive effects.<Reference refidx="16"/>  In one study, following the appearance of spontaneous <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044345">prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046324">lesions</GlossaryTermRef>, TRAMP mice were fed control diets or diets supplemented with genistein (250 or 1,000 mg genistein/kg chow). Mice fed low-dose genistein exhibited more cancer cell metastasis and greater osteopontin expression than mice fed the control or the high-dose genistein diet. These results indicate that timing and dose of genistein treatment may affect prostate cancer outcomes and that genistein may exert biphasic control over prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="17"/>  In a  study reported in 2008, athymic mice were implanted with human prostate cancer cells and fed a control or genistein-supplemented diet (100 or 250 mg genistein/kg chow). Mice that were fed genistein exhibited less cancer  cell metastasis, but no change in primary tumor volume, than did mice fed a control diet. Furthermore, other data suggested that genistein  inhibits metastasis by impairing cancer cell detachment.<Reference refidx="18"/>  In contrast, in a study reported in 2011, there were more metastases in secondary <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000257523">organs</GlossaryTermRef> in genistein-treated mice than in vehicle-treated mice.  In this latter study,  mice were implanted with human prostate cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044095">xenografts</GlossaryTermRef> and treated daily with genistein dissolved in peanut oil (80 mg genistein/kg body weight/day or 400 mg genistein/kg body weight/day) or peanut oil vehicle by gavage.   In addition, there was a reduction in tumor cell apoptosis in the genistein-treated mice compared with the vehicle-treated mice. These findings suggest that genistein may stimulate metastasis in an animal model of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000478743">advanced</GlossaryTermRef> prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="19"/></Para><Para id="_119"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044971">Radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef> is commonly used in prostate cancer, but, despite this treatment,   disease <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045861">recurrence</GlossaryTermRef> is common. Therefore, combining radiation with additional therapies may provide longer-lasting results.  In one study, human prostate cancer cells were treated with soy isoflavones and/or radiation. Cells that were treated with both isoflavones and radiation exhibited greater decreases in cell survival and greater expression of proapoptotic <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045065">molecules</GlossaryTermRef> than cells treated with  isoflavones or radiation only. Nude mice were implanted with prostate cancer cells and treated by gavage with genistein (21.5 mg/kg body weight/day), mixed isoflavones (50 mg/kg body weight/day; contained 43% genistein, 21% daidzein, and 2% glycitein)  and/or radiation. Mixed isoflavones were more effective than genistein in inhibiting prostate tumor growth, and combining isoflavones with radiation resulted in the largest inhibition of tumor growth. In addition, mice given soy isoflavones in combination with radiation did not exhibit <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045762">lymph node</GlossaryTermRef> metastasis, which was seen previously in other experiments combining genistein with radiation. These preclinical findings suggest that mixed isoflavones may increase the efficacy of radiation therapy for prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="20"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_120"><Title>Human Studies</Title><Para id="_121">Numerous clinical studies have been conducted examining the impact of soy use on indicators of the effectiveness of prostate cancer prevention or treatment approaches.

The results revealed that Zyflamend, at a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000683342">concentration</GlossaryTermRef> of 0.9 μL/mL, inhibited  expression of both COX-1 and COX-2. At a concentration of 0.45 μL/mL, the degree of COX-2 inhibition was observed, but the level of COX-1 inhibition was reduced by 50%. At a concentration of 0.1 μL/mL, Zyflamend effectively  inhibited growth of prostate cancer cells and increased the level of caspase-3, a proapoptotic enzyme. However, a separate experiment indicated that the prostate cancer cells used in the study (LNCaP cells, which  are androgen sensitive) did not express high levels of COX-2, suggesting that Zyflamend’s effects on prostate cancer cells may result from a COX-independent mechanism.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_499">The lipoxygenase isozymes 5-LOX and 12-LOX are also proteins associated with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044042">inflammation</GlossaryTermRef> and tumor growth. In a 2007 study, the effects of  Zyflamend on 5-LOX and 12-LOX expression were investigated. The findings indicated that 0.25 μL/mL to 2 μL/mL of Zyflamend produced decreases in  5-LOX and 12-LOX expression in PC3 prostate cancer cells (cells that have high <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044058">metastatic</GlossaryTermRef> potential). The supplement also inhibited <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046479">cell proliferation</GlossaryTermRef> and induced <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046524">apoptosis</GlossaryTermRef>. In addition, Zyflamend treatment resulted in a decrease in Rb <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000641137">phosphorylation</GlossaryTermRef> (Rb proteins control <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000597111">cell-cycle</GlossaryTermRef>-related genes). These results indicate that Zyflamend may inhibit prostate cancer cell growth through a variety of mechanisms.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_500">In a 2011 study, human prostate cancer cells were treated with Zyflamend (200 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000306521">µg</GlossaryTermRef>/mL). After 48 hours of treatment, a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044167">statistically significant</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000654999">reduction</GlossaryTermRef> in cell growth was observed for Zyflamend-treated cells, compared with control cells (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .005). In another experiment, prostate cancer cells were treated with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000653119">insulin-like growth factor</GlossaryTermRef>-1 (IGF-1; 0–100 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000285977">ng</GlossaryTermRef>/mL) alone or in combination with Zyflamend (200 µg/mL). Cells treated with IGF-1 alone exhibited statistically significant, dose-dependent increases in cell proliferation, whereas  cells treated with both IGF-1 and Zyflamend showed significant decreases in cell proliferation. Zyflamend was also shown to decrease cellular levels of the IGF-1 receptor and the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells.<Reference refidx="7"/> A 2014 investigation by this team found that Zyflamend inhibits the expression of class I and class II histone deacetylases (HDAC) and upregulated their downstream target p21 suppressor gene.<Reference refidx="8"/> The extracts of the individual components of the 10 botanicals in Zyflamend were also evaluated in an effort to identify which compounds contributed most to the inhibition of HDAC expression. Chinese goldthread and baikal skullcap appeared to be the most likely major contributors to the overall Zyflamend effect on HDAC expression.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_501"><Title>Animal studies</Title><Para id="_502">Additional evidence that Zyflamend promotes apoptosis in cancer cells was obtained in laboratory and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454774">animal studies</GlossaryTermRef> reported in 2012.<Reference refidx="9"/>  Treatment of human <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046685">colorectal</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045963">carcinoma</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044016">cell lines</GlossaryTermRef> <Emphasis>in vitro</Emphasis> with Zyflamend was shown to  significantly down regulate expression of antiapoptotic proteins, up regulate expression of Bax (a proapoptotic <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046092">protein</GlossaryTermRef>), and  increase expression of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000641151">death receptor 5</GlossaryTermRef> (DR5), a receptor important in apoptosis. Moreover, when nude mice with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044521">pancreatic cancer</GlossaryTermRef> cell implants were randomly assigned to receive Zyflamend or a control treatment for 4 weeks, tumor cells from the Zyflamend-treated mice showed significant reductions in antiapoptotic proteins and significantly increased expression of DR5, compared with tumor cells from control-treated animals.</Para><Para id="_503">In a 2011 study, mice were also implanted with pancreatic cancer cells and then treated with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045347">gemcitabine</GlossaryTermRef> and/or Zyflamend.
