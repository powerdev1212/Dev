Knowledge of cancer genetics is rapidly improving our understanding of cancer biology, helping to identify at-risk individuals, furthering the ability to characterize malignancies, establishing treatment tailored to the molecular fingerprint of the disease, and leading to the development of new therapeutic modalities.  As a consequence, this expanding knowledge base has implications for all aspects of cancer management, including prevention, screening, and treatment.  </Para><Para id="_3">Genetic information provides a means of identifying people who have an increased risk of cancer.  Sources of genetic information include biologic samples of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045671">DNA</GlossaryTermRef>, information derived from a person’s <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000302456">family history</GlossaryTermRef> of disease, findings from physical examinations, and medical records. DNA-based information can be gathered, stored, and analyzed at any time during an individual’s life span, from before conception to after death.  Family history may identify people with a modest to moderately increased risk of cancer or may serve as the first step in the identification of an inherited cancer predisposition that confers a very high lifetime risk of cancer.  For an increasing number of diseases, DNA-based testing can be used to identify a specific <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046063">mutation</GlossaryTermRef> as the cause of inherited risk and to determine whether family members have inherited the disease-related mutation.</Para><Para id="_2584">The proportion of individuals carrying a mutation who will manifest the
disease is referred to as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339344">penetrance</GlossaryTermRef>.  In general, common genetic variants that are associated with cancer susceptibility have a lower penetrance than rare genetic variants. This is depicted in <SummaryRef href="CDR0000517309#_2583" url="/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/overview-pdq">Figure 1</SummaryRef>. For adult-onset diseases, penetrance is
usually described by the individual carrier's age and sex.  For example, the
penetrance for breast cancer in female <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> mutation carriers is often quoted by age 50 years and by age 70 years. Of the numerous methods for estimating penetrance, none are without potential biases, and determining an individual mutation carrier's risk of cancer involves some level of imprecision. <MediaLink ref="CDR0000746226" type="image/jpeg" alt="Graph shows relative risk on the x-axis and allele frequency on the y-axis.

Mutations can have harmful, beneficial, neutral, or uncertain effects on health and may be inherited as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339338">autosomal dominant</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339339">autosomal recessive</GlossaryTermRef>, or X-linked traits.  Mutations that cause serious disability early in life are usually rare because of their adverse effect on life expectancy and reproduction.  However, if the mutation is autosomal recessive—that is, if the health effect of the mutation is caused only when two copies (one from each parent) of the mutated gene are inherited—mutation <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460132">carriers</GlossaryTermRef> (healthy people carrying one copy of the altered gene) may be relatively common in the general population.  "Common" in this context refers, by convention, to a prevalence of 1% or more.  Mutations that cause health effects in middle and older age, including several mutations known to cause a predisposition to cancer, may also be relatively common.  Many cancer-predisposing traits are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, that is, the cancer susceptibility occurs when only one copy of the altered gene is inherited. For autosomal dominant conditions, the term “carrier” is often used in a less formal manner to denote people who have inherited the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460153">genetic predisposition</GlossaryTermRef> conferred by the mutation.  Refer to individual PDQ summaries focused on the genetics of specific cancers for detailed information on known cancer-susceptibility syndromes. </Para><Para id="_5">Increasingly, the public is turning to the Internet for information related both to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460148">familial</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000256553">genetic susceptibility</GlossaryTermRef> to cancer and to genetic <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460214">risk assessment</GlossaryTermRef> and testing.  Direct-to-consumer marketing of genetic testing for hereditary breast and colon cancer is also taking place in some communities.  This wider availability of information related to inherited cancer risk may raise concerns among persons previously unaware of the implications inherent in their family histories and may lead some of these individuals to consult their primary care physicians for management advice and recommendations.  In many instances, the evaluation and advice will be relatively straightforward for physicians with a basic knowledge of familial cancer. In a subset of patients, the evaluation may be more complex, calling for referral to genetics professionals for further evaluation and counseling.</Para><Para id="_6">Correctly recognizing and identifying individuals and families at increased risk of developing cancer is one of countless important roles for primary care and other health care providers.  Once identified, these individuals can then be appropriately referred for <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044961">genetic counseling</GlossaryTermRef>, risk assessment, consideration of genetic testing, and development of a management plan.  When medical and family histories reveal cardinal clues to the presence of an underlying familial or genetic cancer susceptibility disorder (see list below),<Reference refidx="1"/> further evaluation may be warranted.

Information about familial cancer risk may also inform a person’s ability to plan for the future (lifestyle and health care decisions, family planning, or other decisions). Genetic information may also provide a direct health benefit by demonstrating the lack of an inherited cancer susceptibility.  For example, if a family is known to carry a cancer-predisposing mutation in a particular gene, a family member may experience reduced worry and lower health care costs if his or her genetic test indicates that he or she does not carry the family’s disease-related mutation. Conversely, information about familial cancer risk may have psychological effects or social costs (e.g., worry, guilt, or increased health care costs). Family dynamics also may be affected.  For instance, the involvement of one or more family members may be required for genetic testing to be <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460156">informative</GlossaryTermRef>, and parents may feel guilt about passing inherited risk on to their children.  </Para><Para id="_84">Knowledge about a cancer-predisposing mutation can be informative not only for the individual tested but also for other family members.  Family members who previously had not considered the implications of their family history for their own health may be led to do so, and some will undergo genetic testing, resulting in more definitive information on whether they are at increased genetic risk. Some relatives may learn their mutation status without being directly tested, for example, when a biological parent of a child who is a known mutation carrier is identified as an obligate carrier.  Founder effects may result in the recognition that specific ethnic groups have a higher prevalence of certain mutations, knowledge that can be either clinically useful (permitting more rational genetic testing strategies) or potentially stigmatizing. Testing may reveal the presence of nonpaternity in a family.  There is the theoretical possibility that genetic information may be misused, and concerns about the potential for insurance and/or 
employment discrimination may arise.  
Genetic information may also affect medical and lifestyle decisions.  </Para><Para id="_85">Refer to

Cancer genetic counseling often involves a multidisciplinary team of health professionals that may include a genetic counselor, an advanced practice genetics nurse, or a medical geneticist; a mental health professional; and various medical experts such as an oncologist, surgeon, or internist.  The process of counseling may require a number of visits to address medical, genetic testing, and psychosocial issues.  Even when cancer risk counseling is initiated by an individual, inherited cancer risk has implications for the entire family.  Because genetic risk affects an unknown number of biological relatives, contact with these relatives is often essential to collect accurate family and medical histories.  Cancer genetic counseling may involve several family members, some of whom will have had cancer and others who have not.</Para><Para id="_36">The impact of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460214">risk assessment</GlossaryTermRef> and predisposition genetic testing is improved health outcomes.  The information derived from risk assessment and/or genetic testing allows the health care provider to tailor an individual approach to health promotion and optimize long-term health outcomes through the identification of at-risk individuals before cancer develops.  The health care provider can thus intervene earlier either to reduce the risk or diagnose a cancer at an earlier stage, when the chances for effective treatment are greatest.  The information may be used to modify the management approach to an initial cancer, clarify the risks of other cancers, or predict the response of an existing cancer to specific forms of treatment, all of which may alter treatment recommendations and long-term follow-up.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="16761103">Resta R, Biesecker BB, Bennett RL, et al.: A new definition of Genetic Counseling: National Society of Genetic Counselors' Task Force report.

Several institutions and companies offer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000768570">tumor sequencing</GlossaryTermRef>, and some are developing precision medicine programs that sequence tumor genomes to identify driver genetic alterations that are targetable for therapeutic benefit to patients.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>  Many of these tumor-based approaches use <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000561402">germline DNA</GlossaryTermRef>  sequences as a reference to discriminate between DNA changes only within the tumor and those that are potentially inherited.  In the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044961">genetic counseling</GlossaryTermRef> and cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460214">risk assessment</GlossaryTermRef>–setting, the use of gene panel testing to evaluate inherited cancer risk is becoming more common and may become routine in the near future, with institutions and companies offering gene panel testing to detect alterations in a host of cancer risk–associated <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045693">genes</GlossaryTermRef>.  </Para><Para id="_2626">These advances in gene sequencing technologies also identify variants in genes related to the primary indication for ordering genetic sequence testing, along with findings not related to the disorder being tested.  The latter genetic findings, termed incidental or secondary findings, are currently a source of significant clinical, ethical, legal, and counseling debate.  This section was created to provide information about genomic sequencing technologies in the context of clinical sequencing and highlights additional areas of clinical uncertainty for which further research and approaches are needed.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_2597"><Title>Background</Title><Para id="_2627">DNA sequencing technologies have undergone rapid evolution, particularly since 2005 when massively parallel sequencing, or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000763024">next-generation sequencing</GlossaryTermRef> (NGS), was introduced.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_2628">Automated <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000763028">Sanger sequencing</GlossaryTermRef> is considered the first generation of sequencing technology.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Sanger cancer gene sequencing uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genetic regions of interest followed by sequencing of PCR products using fluorescently labeled terminators, capillary electrophoresis separation of products, and laser signal detection of nucleotide sequence.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/>  While this is an accurate sequencing  technology, the main limitations of Sanger sequencing  include low <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000763031">throughput</GlossaryTermRef>, a limited ability to sequence more than a few genes at a time, and the inability to detect structural rearrangements.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_2629">NGS refers to high throughput DNA sequencing technologies that are capable of processing multiple DNA sequences in parallel.<Reference refidx="7"/>  Although platforms differ in template generation and sequence interrogation, the overall approach to NGS technologies involves shearing and immobilizing DNA template molecules onto a solid surface, which allows separation of molecules for simultaneous sequencing reactions (millions to billions) to be performed in a parallel fashion.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="8"/> Thus, the major advantages of NGS technologies include the ability to sequence thousands of genes at one time, a lower cost, and the ability to detect multiple types of genomic alterations such as insertions, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460141">deletions</GlossaryTermRef>, copy number alterations, and rearrangements.<Reference refidx="6"/>   Limitations include the possibility that specific gene regions may be missed, turnaround time can be lengthy (although it is decreasing), and informatics support to handle massive amounts of genetic data has lagged behind the sequencing capability.  A well-recognized bottleneck to utilizing NGS data is the lack of advanced computational infrastructure to preserve, process, and analyze the vast amount of genetic data.  The magnitude of the variants obtained from NGS is exponential; bioinformatics approaches need to evaluate genetic variants for predicted functional consequence in disease biology.  There is also a need for user-friendly bioinformatics pipelines to analyze and integrate genetic data to influence the scientific and medical community.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_2599">The following terms are defined to better understand the clinical application of NGS testing and implications of results reported.</Para><ItemizedList id="_2600" Style="bullet" Compact="No">

In oncology, the two dominant applications are: 1) the assessment of somatic alterations in tumors to inform prognosis and/or targeted therapeutics; and 2) the assessment of the germline to identify cancer risk <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339337">alleles</GlossaryTermRef>. </Para><SummarySection id="_2616"><Title>Somatic testing</Title><Para id="_2617">There are multiple approaches to tumor testing for somatic alterations. With targeted gene panel testing, a number of different genes can be assessed simultaneously. These targeted panels can differ substantially in the genes that are included, and they can be tailored to individual tumor types. Targeted gene panels limit the data to be analyzed and include only known genes, which makes the interpretation more straightforward than in whole exome or whole genome techniques. In addition, greater depth of coverage is possible with targeted panels, compared with WES or WGS. Depth of coverage refers to the number of times a nucleotide has been sequenced; a greater depth of coverage has fewer sequencing errors.  Deep coverage also aids in differentiating sequencing errors from <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000458046">single nucleotide polymorphisms</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para><Para id="_2618">WES and WGS are far more extensive techniques and aim to uncover mutations in known genes and in genes not suspected a priori.   The discovery of a mutation that is unexpected for a particular  tumor type can lead to the use of a directed therapeutic, which could improve patient outcome. WES generates sequence data of the coding regions of the genome (representing approximately 1% of the human genome), rather than the entire genome (WGS).  Consequently, WES is less expensive than WGS. </Para><Para id="_2619">Noncoding variants can be identified using WGS but cannot be identified using WES. The use of WGS is limited by cost and the vast bioinformatics needed for interpretation. Although the costs of sequencing have dropped precipitously, the analysis remains formidable.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_2620">Although the goal of WES and WGS is to improve patient care by detecting actionable genetic mutations (mutations that can be targeted therapeutically), a number of issues warrant consideration.  This testing may detect <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000556486">deleterious mutations</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000556495">variants of uncertain significance</GlossaryTermRef>, or no detectable abnormalities. In addition, deleterious mutations can be found in genes that are thought to be clearly related to tumorigenesis but can also be detected in genes with unclear relevance (particularly with WES and WGS approaches). Variants of uncertain significance have unclear implications as they may, or may not, disrupt the function of the protein. The definition of actionable can vary, but often this term is used when an aberration, if found, would lead to recommendations against certain treatments (such as mutations in <GeneName>ras</GeneName>) for which a clinical trial is available, or for which there is a known targeted drug. Although there are case reports of success with this approach, it is unlikely to be straightforward.  Studies are ongoing. </Para><Para id="_2621">Some commercial and single-institution assays test only the tumor. Clearly deleterious mutations found in important genes in the tumor can be somatic but could also be from the germline. In situations in which somatic analysis is paired with a germline analysis, it is known whether the alteration is inherited; when somatic analysis only is performed, it is not known. Reported allelic frequencies of the mutation in the somatic analysis can provide clues, but they are not always reported by laboratories and do not give a definitive answer. As many medical professionals do not have a deep understanding of genetics, guidance as to when to proceed to germline testing would be valuable.</Para><Para id="_2653">Ongoing clinical trials, such as the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/noteworthy-trials/match">NCI Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice Program</ExternalRef>, are examining the value of somatic sequencing to find actionable targets.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_2622"><Title>Germline testing</Title><Para id="_2623">The goal of germline testing is to identify mutations associated with an  inherited risk of cancer and to guide cancer risk–management decisions. Also, germline testing can aid in some management decisions at the time of diagnosis (e.g., decisions about colectomy in Lynch syndrome–related colon cancer and contralateral mastectomy in <GeneName>BRCA1/2</GeneName> mutation carriers). In addition, there are emerging data that germline status may help determine systemic therapy (e.g., the use of cisplatin or PARP inhibitors in <GeneName>BRCA1/2</GeneName>-related cancer). </Para><Para id="_2624">To date, most germline genetic testing has been performed in a targeted manner, looking for the gene(s) associated with a clinical picture (e.g., <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer; or the mismatch repair [MMR] genes in Lynch syndrome). However, multiple targeted gene panels now available commercially or within an institution contain different sets of genes. Some are targeted to all cancers, others to specific cancers (e.g.,  breast, colon, or prostate cancers). The genes on the panels include high penetrance genes related to the specific tumor (such as  <GeneName>BRCA1/2</GeneName> on a breast cancer panel); high penetrance genes related to a different type of cancer but with a more moderate risk for the tumor of reference (such as <GeneName>CDH1</GeneName> or <GeneName>MSH6</GeneName> on a breast cancer panel); and moderate penetrance genes for which clinical utility is uncertain (such as <GeneName>NBN </GeneName>on a breast cancer panel). Because multiple genes are included on these panels, it is anticipated that many, and perhaps most, individuals undergoing testing using these panels will be found to have at least one variant of unknown significance. As it is not possible to do standard pretest counseling models for a panel of 20 genes, new counseling models are needed. Ethical issues of whether patients can opt out of specific results (such as <GeneName>TP53</GeneName> or <GeneName>CDH1</GeneName> in breast cancer) and how this would be done in clinical practice are unresolved. </Para><Para id="_2625">WES for inherited cancer susceptibility is also commercially available.

At the purely technical level, improvements in the sequencing technique have allowed for sequencing across the entire genome, not merely the exome.  As the costs decrease, exomic and genomic sequencing of tumor and normal tissue can be expected to become more routine.</Para><Para id="_2605">With routine use of WGS, major challenges in interpretation emerge.  Foremost is the matter of determining which sequence variations in known cancer predisposition genes are pathologic, which are harmless, and which variations require further evaluation as to  their significance.  This is not a new challenge. Various groups are developing processes for the interpretation and curation of a growing database of variants and their significance. For example, the International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumors has developed such a process for the MMR genes in concert with the Human Variome Project and International Mismatch Repair Consortium.  </Para><Para id="_2606">These processes may serve as a framework for the emerging challenge of interpreting the significance of sequence variations in genes of uncertain or unknown function in regulation of neoplastic progression or other diseases.  Larger cancer predisposition panels have been developed by commercial laboratories, with their own process for interpretation.  To the extent that increasingly larger panels include genes of unknown significance, governance of the interpretation process requires that academic institutions offering their own panels or using external proprietary panels develop a deliberative process for managing the quality assurance for test performance (including Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments [CLIA], where appropriate) and interpretation.</Para><Para id="_2607">ACMG has issued the following updated guidelines for achieving accountability in interpreting and reporting incidental variants:<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="14"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_2608" Style="bullet" Compact="No">

The nature of discussions between oncologists and patients would be altered to include the multiple facets involved with germline testing and potential results.  Pre- and post-test discussions would also potentially require involvement of genetic counselors and geneticists, who are a limited resource in oncology practices. Recent expert comment stated that more data are needed about the benefits of return of incidental germline findings to cancer patients undergoing tumor sequencing, citing a need for recommendations by experts in the oncology and genetics communities.<Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Para id="_2609">It is still very early in the development processes for oversight at the institutional level.
