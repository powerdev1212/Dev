It is used by patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef> mainly as  a form of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046609">supportive care</GlossaryTermRef> that may improve <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef> and  reduce <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000450122">stress</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000430405">anxiety</GlossaryTermRef>. Aromatherapy  may be combined with other <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044951">complementary</GlossaryTermRef> treatments like <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454761">massage therapy</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046724">acupuncture</GlossaryTermRef>, as well as with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044930">standard treatments</GlossaryTermRef>, for <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000269453">symptom management</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para><Para id="_20">Essential oils (also known as volatile oils) are the basic materials of aromatherapy. They are made from <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462679">fragrant</GlossaryTermRef> essences found in  many plants.  These essences are made  in special plant <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046476">cells</GlossaryTermRef>, often under the surface of leaves, bark, or peel, using energy from the sun and elements from the air, soil, and water. If the  plant is crushed, the essence and its unique fragrance are released. </Para><Para id="_28">When  essences are extracted from plants in natural ways, they become    essential oils. They may be distilled  with  steam and/or  water, or mechanically pressed.   Oils that are made with chemical processes are not considered true essential oils. </Para><Para id="_2">There are many essential oils used in aromatherapy, including those from <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462682">Roman chamomile</GlossaryTermRef>,  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462680">geranium</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462684">lavender</GlossaryTermRef>,  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462961">tea tree</GlossaryTermRef>,     <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000537557">lemon</GlossaryTermRef>,  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462670">cedarwood</GlossaryTermRef>, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462666">bergamot</GlossaryTermRef>.  Each type of essential oil has a different chemical composition  that affects how it smells, how it is  absorbed, and how it  is used by the body. Even the oils from varieties of plants within the same species may have chemical compositions different from each other. The same applies to plants that are grown or harvested in different ways or  locations.  </Para><Para id="_6">Essential oils are very concentrated.   For example, it  takes about 220 lbs of lavender flowers to make about 1 pound of essential oil. Essential oils are very volatile, evaporating quickly when they are exposed to open air.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_46"><Question>What is the history of the discovery and use of aromatherapy as a
            complementary and alternative treatment for cancer?
</Question><Answer><Para id="_29">Fragrant plants have been used in healing practices for thousands of years across many cultures, including ancient China, India, and Egypt.   Ways to extract  essential oils from plants  were first discovered during the Middle Ages.  </Para>  <Para id="_30">The history of modern aromatherapy began in the early 20th century, when French chemist Rene Gattefosse coined the term "aromatherapy" and studied the effects of essential oils on many kinds of diseases. In the 1980s and 1990s, aromatherapy was rediscovered in Western countries as interest in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044964">complementary and alternative medicine</GlossaryTermRef> (CAM)  began to grow. </Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_47"><Question>What is the theory behind the claim that aromatherapy is useful in treating cancer?</Question><Answer><Para id="_4">Aromatherapy is rarely  suggested as a treatment for cancer, but rather as a form of supportive care to manage <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045022">symptoms</GlossaryTermRef> of cancer or    <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046580">side effects</GlossaryTermRef> of cancer treatment.  There are different theories about how aromatherapy and essential oils work. A leading theory is that smell <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044958">receptors</GlossaryTermRef> in the nose may respond to the smells of essential oils by sending chemical messages along <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000373935">nerve</GlossaryTermRef> pathways to the brain's <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462685">limbic system</GlossaryTermRef>, which affects moods and emotions.  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046361">Imaging</GlossaryTermRef> studies in humans help show the effects of smells on the limbic system and its emotional pathways.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_48"><Question>How is aromatherapy  administered?</Question><Answer><Para id="_17">Aromatherapy is used in various ways. Examples  include:</Para><ItemizedList id="_18" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Indirect <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044600">inhalation</GlossaryTermRef> (patient breathes in essential oils by using a room diffuser or placing drops  nearby).</ListItem><ListItem>Direct inhalation (patient breathes in essential oils by using an individual <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000439402">inhaler</GlossaryTermRef> with drops floated on top of hot water) to treat a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000641960">sinus</GlossaryTermRef> headache.</ListItem><ListItem><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462663">Aromatherapy massage</GlossaryTermRef> (massaging essential oils, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462674">diluted</GlossaryTermRef> in a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462669">carrier oil</GlossaryTermRef>,  into the skin).</ListItem><ListItem>Applying  essential oils to the skin by combining them with bath salts,  lotions, or dressings.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_19">Aromatherapy is rarely taken  by mouth. </Para><Para id="_7">There are some essential oils commonly chosen to treat  specific  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000651193">conditions</GlossaryTermRef>. However, the types of oils used and the ways they are combined may  vary, depending on the experience and training of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000537555">aromatherapist</GlossaryTermRef>. This lack of standard methods has led to some conflicting research on the effects of aromatherapy.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_49"><Question>Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies  been conducted using    
	aromatherapy?
</Question><Answer><Para id="_9"> Many studies of essential oils have found that they have <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462660">antibacterial</GlossaryTermRef> effects when  applied to the skin. Some essential oils have <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046088">antiviral</GlossaryTermRef> activity against the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000644314">herpes simplex virus</GlossaryTermRef>. Others have <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046085">antifungal</GlossaryTermRef> activity against certain <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044308">vaginal</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046024">oropharyngeal</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044571">fungal</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045364">infections</GlossaryTermRef>. In addition,  studies in rats have shown that different essential oils can be calming or energizing. When rats were exposed to certain fragrances under <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000450122">stressful</GlossaryTermRef> conditions, their behavior and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045722">immune responses</GlossaryTermRef> were improved.    </Para><Para id="_5"> One study showed that after essential oils were inhaled, markers of the fragrance <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000422394">compounds</GlossaryTermRef> were found in the bloodstream, suggesting that aromatherapy affects the body directly like a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000348921">drug</GlossaryTermRef>,  in addition to indirectly through the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046481">central nervous system</GlossaryTermRef>.       </Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_50"><Question>Have any  clinical trials (research studies with people) of aromatherapy been conducted?</Question><Answer><Para id="_21"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045961">Clinical  trials</GlossaryTermRef> of aromatherapy have mainly studied its use in the treatment of stress, anxiety, and other health-related conditions in seriously ill patients. Several  clinical trials of aromatherapy in patients with cancer have been published with mixed results.</Para><Para id="_8">A few early studies have shown that aromatherapy may improve <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef> in patients with cancer.   Some patients receiving aromatherapy  have  reported improvement in symptoms such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000390302">nausea</GlossaryTermRef> or pain, and have lower <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462668">blood pressure</GlossaryTermRef>, pulse, and respiratory rates. Studies of aromatherapy massage have had mixed results, with some studies reporting improvement in mood, anxiety, pain, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000407757">constipation</GlossaryTermRef> and other studies reporting no effect.</Para><Para id="_58">A study of inhaled bergamot in children and adolescents receiving <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046695">stem cell transplants</GlossaryTermRef> reported an increase in anxiety and nausea  and no effect on pain. Parents receiving the aromatherapy and parents receiving the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046688">placebo</GlossaryTermRef> both showed less anxiety after their children’s transplants. In a study of adult patients receiving stem cell transplants, tasting or sniffing sliced oranges was more effective at reducing nausea, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000476298">retching</GlossaryTermRef>, and coughing  than inhaling an orange essential oil.</Para><Para id="_33">A small study of tea tree oil as a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045927">topical</GlossaryTermRef> treatment to clear <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045967">antibiotic</GlossaryTermRef>-resistant MRSA <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044123">bacteria</GlossaryTermRef> from the skin of hospital patients found that it was as effective as the standard treatment.

Some essential oils have been approved  as ingredients in  food and are classified as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454785">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</GlossaryTermRef>, within specific limits. Swallowing large amounts of essential oils is not recommended. </Para><Para id="_14"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000443292">Allergic reactions</GlossaryTermRef> and  skin irritation may  occur in   aromatherapists or in patients, especially when essential oils are in contact with the skin for long periods of time.

Professionals often combine aromatherapy training with another field in which they are licensed, for example, massage therapy, registered nursing, acupuncture, or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000537556">naturopathy</GlossaryTermRef>. Some aromatherapy courses for <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000650566">healthcare providers</GlossaryTermRef> offer medical credit hours and include conducting    research and measuring results.</Para><Para id="_55"> The National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy (<ExternalRef xref="http://www.naha.org/">www.naha.org</ExternalRef>) and the Alliance of International Aromatherapists  (<ExternalRef xref="http://www.alliance-aromatherapists.org/">www.alliance-aromatherapists.org</ExternalRef>)    are two organizations that have national educational standards for aromatherapists.

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_2"><Title>General CAM Information</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_3">Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also referred to as integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_4">Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_5">Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. </Para></SummarySection>

The National Cancer Institute  and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_8">Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH)  in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.</Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_9"><ExternalRef xref="http://cam.cancer.gov/cam/best_case_intro.html">The NCI Best Case Series Program</ExternalRef>   which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.</Para></SummarySection>
