cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team
of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during
childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the primary care physician, an orthopedic surgeon experienced in bone
tumors, a pathologist, radiation oncologists, pediatric oncologists,
rehabilitation specialists, pediatric nurse specialists, social workers, and
others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and
rehabilitation that will achieve optimal survival and quality of life.   
(Refer to the PDQ summaries on <ExternalRef xref="http://cancer.gov/cancerinfo/pdq/supportivecare/">Supportive and Palliative Care</ExternalRef> for specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer.) </Para><Para id="_72">Guidelines for pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of
pediatric patients with cancer have been outlined by the American Academy of
Pediatrics.<Reference refidx="2"/>  At these pediatric cancer centers, clinical trials are
available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and
adolescents, and the opportunity to participate in these trials is offered to
most patients/families.  Clinical trials for children and adolescents with
cancer are generally designed to compare potentially better therapy with
therapy that is currently accepted as standard.  Most of the progress
made in identifying curative therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved
through clinical trials.  Information about ongoing clinical trials is
available from the <ExternalRef xref="http://cancer.gov/clinicaltrials">NCI  website</ExternalRef>.</Para><Para id="_87">Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2010, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.<Reference refidx="1"/> For osteosarcoma, the 5-year survival rate increased over the same time from 40% to 76% in children younger than 15 years and from 56% to approximately 66% in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close follow-up because cancer therapy side effects may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000343584" url="/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq">Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer</SummaryRef> for specific information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors.)</Para><Para id="_4">Osteosarcoma occurs predominantly in adolescents and young
adults.  Review of data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results  program of the National Cancer Institute resulted in an estimate of 4.4 cases per 1 million new cases of osteosarcoma each year in people aged  0 to 24 years.<Reference refidx="3"/> The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that there will be 110 million people in this age range in 2010, resulting in an incidence of roughly 450 cases per year in children and young adults younger than 25 years. Osteosarcoma accounts for approximately 5% of childhood tumors.  In
children and adolescents, more than 50% of these tumors arise from the long bones around the
knee. Osteosarcoma can rarely be observed in soft tissue or visceral organs. There appears to be no difference in presenting symptoms, tumor location, and outcome for younger patients (&lt;12 years) compared with adolescents.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/> Two trials conducted in the 1980s were designed to determine whether chemotherapy altered the natural history of osteosarcoma after surgical removal of the primary tumor.  The outcome of patients in these trials who were treated with
surgical removal of the primary tumor recapitulated the historical
experience before 1970; more than half of these patients developed metastases
within 6 months of diagnosis, and overall,  approximately 90% developed recurrent
disease within 2 years of diagnosis.<Reference refidx="6"/>    Overall survival for patients
treated with surgery alone was statistically inferior.<Reference refidx="7"/>  The natural history
of osteosarcoma has not changed over time, and fewer than 20% of patients with
localized resectable primary tumors treated  with surgery alone can be expected
to survive free of relapse.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="8"/>; <Reference refidx="9"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335125">Level of evidence: 1iiA</LOERef>]</Para><SummarySection id="_363"><Title>Prognostic Factors</Title><Para id="_364">Pretreatment factors that influence outcome include the following:<Reference refidx="10"/> </Para><ItemizedList id="_445" Style="bullet"><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062698#_365" url="/types/bone/hp/osteosarcoma-treatment-pdq">Primary tumor site</SummaryRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062698#_368" url="/types/bone/hp/osteosarcoma-treatment-pdq">Size of the primary tumor</SummaryRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062698#_370" url="/types/bone/hp/osteosarcoma-treatment-pdq">Presence of clinically detectable metastatic disease</SummaryRef>.  </ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_446">After administration of preoperative chemotherapy, factors that influence outcome include the following: </Para><ItemizedList id="_447" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Surgical resectability.</ListItem><ListItem>Degree of tumor necrosis.  </ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_448">In general, prognostic factors in osteosarcoma have not been helpful in identifying patients who might benefit from treatment intensification or who might require less therapy while maintaining an excellent outcome.</Para><SummarySection id="_365"><Title>Primary tumor site</Title><Para id="_344">The site of the primary tumor is a significant prognostic factor for patients with localized disease. Among extremity tumors, distal sites have a more favorable prognosis than do proximal sites.

As many as 20% of patients will have radiographically detectable metastases at diagnosis, with the lung being the most common site.<Reference refidx="27"/> The prognosis for patients with metastatic disease appears to be determined largely by the site(s), the number of metastases, and the surgical resectability of the metastatic disease.<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_351" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem><Strong>Site of metastases:</Strong> Prognosis appears more favorable for patients with fewer pulmonary nodules and for those with unilateral rather than bilateral pulmonary metastases;<Reference refidx="28"/>   not all patients with suspected pulmonary metastases at diagnosis have osteosarcoma confirmed at the time of lung resection.

Skip metastasis in a bone other than the primary bone should be considered systemic metastasis. Historically,  metastasis across a joint was referred to as a skip lesion. Skip lesions across a joint might be considered hematogenous spread and have a worse prognosis.<Reference refidx="31"/> <Para id="_352">Patients with multifocal osteosarcoma (defined as multiple bone lesions without a clear primary tumor) have   an extremely poor prognosis.<Reference refidx="32"/></Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Surgical resectability of metastases:</Strong> Patients who have complete surgical ablation of the primary and metastatic tumor (when confined to the lung) after chemotherapy may attain long-term survival, although overall event-free survival remains about 20% to 30% for patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis.<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/>  </ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_372"><Title>Adequacy of tumor resection</Title><Para id="_373">Resectability of the tumor is a critical prognostic feature because osteosarcoma is relatively resistant to radiation therapy.

The availability of the entire tumor allows the pathologist to examine more tissue, and evaluate soft tissue and lymphovascular invasion, which can often clarify the nature of the lesion.  If the lesion proves to have high-grade elements, systemic chemotherapy is indicated, just as it would be for any high-grade osteosarcoma.  The Pediatric Oncology Group performed a study in which high-grade osteosarcoma patients were randomly assigned to either immediate definitive surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy or an initial period of chemotherapy followed by definitive surgery.<Reference refidx="3"/>  The outcome was the same for both groups.
