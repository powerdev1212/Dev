cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team
of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during
childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the primary care physician, pediatric surgical subspecialists, pediatric radiation
oncologist, pediatric hematologist/oncologist, rehabilitation specialist,
pediatric nurse specialists, social workers, and others to ensure that
children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation that will
achieve optimal survival and quality of life.   Refer to the PDQ <ExternalRef xref="http://cancer.gov/cancerinfo/pdq/supportivecare">Supportive and Palliative Care</ExternalRef> summaries for specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer.</Para><Para id="_137">Guidelines for pediatric cancer
centers and their role in the treatment of pediatric patients with cancer have
been outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics.<Reference refidx="2"/>  At these pediatric
cancer centers, clinical trials are available for most types of cancer
that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity to participate in
these trials is offered to most patients/families.  Clinical trials for
children and adolescents with cancer are generally designed to compare
potentially better therapy with therapy that is currently accepted as standard. 
Most of the progress made in identifying curative therapies for
childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.  Information about
ongoing clinical trials is available from the <ExternalRef xref="http://cancer.gov/clinicaltrials">NCI  Web site</ExternalRef>.</Para><Para id="_174">Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2010, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close follow-up because cancer therapy side effects may persist or develop months or years after treatment.

Generally, it is better to image the lesion before any interventions. Plain films  can be used  to rule out bone involvement and detect calcifications that may be seen in soft tissue tumors such as extraskeletal osteosarcoma or synovial sarcoma. Chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) of chest are essential to assess the presence of metastases. CT can be used to image  intra-abdominal tumors, such as liposarcoma, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used for extremity lesions.</Para><Para id="_642">Nonrhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue tumors are fairly readily distinguished pathologically
from rhabdomyosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma; however, classification of childhood nonrhabdomyosarcomatous STS type is often difficult. Core-needle biopsy, incisional biopsy, or excisional biopsy can be used to diagnose a nonrhabdomyosarcomatous STS. Fine-needle biopsy is usually not recommended because it is difficult to determine the accurate histologic diagnosis and grade of the tumor in this heterogeneous group of tumors. If possible, the surgeon who will perform the definitive resection needs to be involved in the biopsy decision. Poorly placed incisions or needle placement may adversely affect the performance of the primary resection.  A core-needle biopsy or small incisional biopsy that obtains adequate tumor tissue is crucial to allow for  conventional
histology, immunocytochemical analysis, and other studies such as light and electron microscopy, cytogenetics, fluorescence <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> hybridization,
and molecular pathology,<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/> given the diagnostic importance of translocations. Needle biopsy techniques must obtain an adequate tissue sample and usually require obtaining multiple cores of tissue. Image guidance using ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI may be necessary to ensure a representative biopsy.<Reference refidx="24"/> Incisional biopsies are acceptable but should not compromise subsequent wide local excision. Excisional biopsy of the lesion is only appropriate for small superficial lesions (&lt;3 cm in size).<Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/> Transverse extremity incisions should be avoided to reduce skin loss, as should extensive surgical procedures before definitive diagnosis.  For these reasons, open biopsy or multiple core-needle biopsies are strongly encouraged
so that adequate tumor tissue can be obtained to allow for crucial
studies to be performed and to avoid limiting future treatment options. Core-needle biopsy for a deep-seated tumor can lead to formation of a hematoma, which affects subsequent resection and/or radiation; in these cases, incisional biopsy is the preferred procedure.</Para><Para id="_813">In children with unplanned resection of nonrhabdomyosarcomatous STSs, primary re-excision is frequently recommended because many patients will have tumor present in the re-excision specimen.<Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/> A single-institution analysis of adolescents and adults compared patients with unplanned excision of STS to stage-matched controls. In this retrospective analysis, unplanned initial excision of STS resulted in increased risk for local recurrence, metastasis, and death, and this increase was greatest for high-grade tumors.<Reference refidx="29"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335144">Level of evidence: 3iiA</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_544">Many nonrhabdomyosarcomatous STSs are
characterized by chromosomal abnormalities.  Some of these chromosomal
translocations lead to a fusion of two disparate genes.  The resulting fusion
transcript can be readily detected by using polymerase chain reaction-based
techniques, thus facilitating the diagnosis of those neoplasms that have
translocations.  Some of the most frequent aberrations seen in
nonrhabdomyosarcomatous soft tissue tumors are listed in Table 2. </Para><Table id="_280">

behavior.  Therefore, several histologic parameters, including degree of
cellularity, cellular pleomorphism, mitotic activity, degree of necrosis, and
invasive growth, are evaluated in the grading process.  This process
is used to improve the correlation between histologic findings and clinical
outcome.<Reference refidx="5"/>  In children, grading of STSs is compromised by
the good prognosis of certain tumors, such as infantile fibrosarcoma and hemangiopericytoma, which have a good prognosis in children younger than 4 years, and also angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, which may recur locally if incompletely excised, but usually do not metastasize.</Para><Para id="_650">Testing a grading system within the pediatric population is
difficult because of the rarity of these neoplasms.  In March 1986, the Pediatric
Oncology Group (POG) conducted a prospective study on pediatric STSs other than rhabdomyosarcoma and devised the grading system that is
shown below.  Analysis of outcome for patients with localized STSs other than rhabdomyosarcoma demonstrated that patients with grade 3
tumors fared significantly worse than those with grade 1 or grade 2

This will vary according to patient variables, including age and gender, and tumor variables, including histopathology, site, size, and grade.  Radiation therapy considerations include the same patient and tumor variables, surgical margin status, and expectations for radiation-induced morbidities such as impaired bone or muscle development, organ damage, or second malignancy. Radiation therapy can be given preoperatively or postoperatively, and the radiation field size and dose will again be based on patient and tumor variables and the operability of the tumor.</Para><Para id="_401">In general, radiation is indicated for patients with inadequate surgical margins and for larger, high-grade tumors.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/>  This is particularly important in high-grade tumors with

Preoperative radiation therapy has been associated with an increased  rate of wound complications in adults, primarily in lower extremity tumors, but the degree of this is questionable.<Reference refidx="22"/> Conversely, preoperative radiation therapy may lead to less fibrosis than with postoperative approaches, perhaps due to the smaller treatment volume and dose.<Reference refidx="23"/> Brachytherapy and

The use of postoperative radiation therapy for patients who presented after primary resection was dependent on the tumor size, grade, and margin status.</Para><Para id="_781">Retroperitoneal sarcomas are a special issue since radiosensitivity of the bowel to injury makes postoperative radiation therapy less desirable.  Reasons for this include the postoperative adhesions and bowel immobility that increase the risk of damage from any given radiation dose.   This is in contrast to the preoperative approach in which the tumor often displaces bowel outside of the radiation field, and any exposed bowel is more mobile, which decreases exposure to specific bowel segments.</Para><Para id="_782">Radiation volume and dose depend on all patient, tumor, and surgical variables as noted above.  Considerations include patient age and growth potential, the ability to avoid critical organs, epiphyseal plates, and lymphatics (but not the neurovascular bundles that are relatively radiation tolerant), and the functional/cosmetic outcome.  Radiation margins are typically 2 cm to 4 cm longitudinally, and encompassing fascial planes axially.  Radiation doses are typically 45 Gy to 50 Gy preoperatively, with consideration for postoperative boost of 10 Gy to 20 Gy if resection margins are microscopically or grossly positive, or planned brachytherapy if the resection is predicted to be subtotal. However, data documenting the efficacy of a postoperative boost are lacking.<Reference refidx="27"/> The postoperative radiation dose is 55 Gy to 60 Gy, or rarely, higher in the situation where unresectable gross residual disease exists.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_402"><Title>Chemotherapy</Title><Para id="_403">The role of adjuvant (postoperative) chemotherapy remains controversial.<Reference refidx="28"/> A meta-analysis of updated data from  adult STS patients from all available randomized trials concluded that recurrence-free survival was better with adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with high-grade tumors larger than 5 cm.<Reference refidx="29"/> The
largest prospective pediatric trial failed to  demonstrate any benefit   with adjuvant
 vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin.<Reference refidx="17"/> In a European trial, adults with completely resected STS were randomly assigned to observation or adjuvant chemotherapy with ifosfamide and doxorubicin. Adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with improved event-free survival or overall survival. It is difficult to extrapolate this trial to pediatric patients because the trial included (1) a wide variety of histologies; (2) a relatively low dose of ifosfamide; (3) patients assigned to chemotherapy had definitive radiation delayed until completion of chemotherapy; and (4) almost one-half of the patients in the trial had intermediate-grade tumors.

For example, the biology of the neoplasm in pediatric patients may differ

Myxoid liposarcoma is typically low grade.  Pleomorphic liposarcoma is typically high grade and much more likely to develop metastasis.  Metastasis to lymph nodes is very uncommon, and the great majority of metastases are pulmonary.  Tumors arising in the periphery are more likely to be low grade and myxoid.  Tumors arising centrally are more likely to be high grade, pleomorphic, and present with metastasis or recur with metastasis.</Para><SummarySection id="_756"><Title>Treatment</Title><Para id="_757">Surgery is the most important treatment for liposarcoma.  After surgical resection of myxoid liposarcoma, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) are roughly 90%.  Local recurrences have been seen and are controlled with a second resection of the tumor.  Higher grade or central tumors are associated with a significantly higher risk of death.  In a retrospective review, 5-year survival for central tumors was 42%.  In the international review, seven of ten patients with pleomorphic myxoid liposarcoma died because of their disease.<Reference refidx="3"/>  If initial surgery is incomplete, re-excision should be performed to achieve a wide margin of resection.  There are reports of the use of chemotherapy to decrease the size of liposarcoma before surgery to facilitate complete resection, particularly in central tumors.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>  The role of adjuvant chemotherapy for liposarcoma is poorly defined.  There does not appear to be a need for any adjuvant therapy for completely resected myxoid liposarcoma.
