In a series analyzing 40 cases of pituitary apoplexy, the presenting signs and symptoms included headache (63%), vomiting (50%), visual field defects (61%), ocular paresis (40%), mental deterioration (13%), hyponatremia (13%), and syncope (5%); in only four cases pituitary tumor was diagnosed prior to presentation.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_283">The development of pituitary adenomas may also occur as a component of three familial cancer syndromes:<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_284" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 (MEN 1).</ListItem><ListItem>Carney complex (e.g., cardiac myxomas, spotty skin pigmentation, and tumors of the adrenal gland and anterior pituitary). </ListItem><ListItem>Isolated familial acromegaly.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_177">A number of other lesions should be considered in the differential diagnosis of sellar masses.

Sellar masses may also result from tumors that are metastatic to the pituitary.  This typically occurs as a part of a generalized metastatic spread and is usually associated with five     or more additional metastatic sites, especially osseous; breast and lung cancer are the most common primary neoplasms metastasizing to the pituitary.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="9861546">Asa SL, Ezzat S: The cytogenesis and pathogenesis of pituitary adenomas.

Tumors are divided into microadenomas (i.e., the greatest diameter is  &lt;10 mm) and macroadenomas (i.e., the greatest diameter is  ≥I0 mm).<Reference refidx="3"/>  Most pituitary adenomas are microadenomas. Historically, the most widely used radioanatomical classification was based primarily on a neuroradiological examination including skull x-rays, pneumoencephalography, polytomography, and carotid angiography <Reference refidx="4"/> and subsequently validated by the application of more accurate computed tomography (CT)  and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).<Para id="_334">An MRI scan is now considered the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of pituitary disorders because of  its multiplanar capability and good soft tissue contrast enhancement.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Sagittal T1-weighted images, clearly displaying the anterior and posterior lobes and the stalk on the same plane, and coronal images, displaying the relation between the pituitary and cavernous sinuses, are optimal for identifying a pituitary adenoma. A 3-mm thin slice typically is used to obtain optimal resolution.<Reference refidx="5"/>  A computed tomography (CT) scan may also be a useful diagnostic tool with coronal scans providing the optimal view;<Reference refidx="6"/>  however, CT scans appear to be less sensitive than MRI scans in this application.<Reference refidx="7"/>  For each imaging technique, a focal hypointensity within the pituitary gland is considered abnormal and suggestive of an adenoma.  An MRI scan is also the best diagnostic imaging choice for pituitary carcinomas; metastases may be found in the cerebral lobes, cerebellum, spinal cord, leptomeninges, and subarachnoid space.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_335">This radioanatomical classification places adenomas into 1 of 4 grades (I–IV).<Reference refidx="9"/> (Refer to the  <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062915#_3" url="/types/pituitary/hp/pituitary-treatment-pdq">Stage Information For Pituitary Tumors</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information.)

the disease, and anatomical structures affected by the tumor extension.  The
majority of patients present with suprasellar extension and visual field
deficits.  In addition, many have hormone deficits prior to treatment. The initial treatment of patients with gonadotroph adenomas is usually by transsphenoidal surgery, particularly if the adenoma presents with neurological symptoms, because the effect of radiation therapy occurs too slowly, and no reliable medical therapy exists.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_255">Surgical management is typically considered the first choice of treatment for patients with endocrine inactive pituitary adenomas because of  its effectiveness in ameliorating symptoms of chiasmal compression and headache.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Radical removal of the tumor, however, is difficult to obtain because of the frequent invasiveness into the cavernous sinus.  Seventy percent to 80% of patients experience normalization or improvement of visual field defects, and almost 100% of patients with headache as a presenting symptom experience relief.  Regrowth of the tumor after radiologically confirmed gross total removal appears to be uncommon.  In a series of 32 patients, only 2 (6.2%) with gross total tumor removal and no postoperative radiation therapy showed radiological recurrence of
the tumor at a mean follow-up of 5.5 years.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_256">Radiation therapy has been administered routinely in the postoperative period and after clear radiological evidence of residual or recurrent tumor has been demonstrated.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>  Drug therapy appears to be of limited value.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/></Para><SummarySection id="_TrialSearch_252_sid_9"><Title>Current Clinical Trials</Title><Para id="_TrialSearch_252_10">Check for U.S. clinical trials from NCI's list of cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with
