The way  people cope is usually linked  to  their personality traits (such as whether they usually  expect the best or  worst, or are shy or  outgoing).</Para><Para id="_234">Coping methods include the use of thoughts and behaviors  in special situations. For example, changing a daily  routine or work schedule to manage the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046580">side effects</GlossaryTermRef> of cancer treatment is a coping method.  Using coping methods can help a patient deal with certain problems,  emotional distress, and cancer in his or her daily life.  </Para><Para id="_235">Patients who adjust well are usually very involved in coping with cancer.

Patients may feel worried and afraid when they have unexplained <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045022">symptoms</GlossaryTermRef> or are having tests done to find out if they have cancer.  </Para><Para id="_78">A diagnosis of cancer can cause expected and normal emotional distress.  Some patients may not believe it and ask, "Are you sure you have the right test results?"  They may feel numb or in shock, or as if "This can't be happening to me". Many patients wonder, "Could I die from this?"  </Para><Para id="_256">Many patients feel they are not able to think clearly and may not understand or remember important information that the doctor gives them about the diagnosis and treatment options.  Patients should have a way to go over this information later.

Questions that patients may ask during treatment include, "Will I survive this?"; "Will they be able to remove all the cancer?"; or "What side effects will I have?"    Finding ways to cope with  problems caused by cancer such as feeling tired, getting to and from treatment, and changes in work schedule  is helpful.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_98"><KeyPoint id="_99">Finishing treatment</KeyPoint><Para id="_100">Finishing cancer treatment can cause mixed feelings.  It may be a time of celebration and relief that treatment has ended. But it may also be a time of worry that the cancer could come back.    Many patients are glad that treatment has ended but feel increased anxiety as  they see their doctors less often.  Other concerns include returning to work and family life and being very worried about any change in their health.  </Para><Para id="_186">During remission, patients may become stressed before <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044671">follow-up</GlossaryTermRef> medical appointments because they  worry that the cancer has come back. Waiting for test results can be very  stressful.</Para><Para id="_102">Patients who are able to express both positive and negative emotions are more likely to adjust well.

The treatment plan then changes from one that is meant to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000318813">cure</GlossaryTermRef> the cancer to one that gives comfort and relieves symptoms. This may cause great anxiety for the patient.   The patient may feel shock and be unable to believe it at first. This may be  followed by a period of distress such as depression, trouble  focusing, and being unable to stop thinking about death.  Signs of normal adjustment include:</Para><ItemizedList id="_187" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Times of sadness and crying.</ListItem><ListItem>Feelings of anger at God or other higher power.</ListItem><ListItem>Times of pulling away from others and wanting to be alone.</ListItem><ListItem>Thoughts of giving up.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_188">Patients slowly adjust to the return of cancer. They stop expecting to be cured of cancer and begin a different kind of healing. This healing is a process of becoming whole again by changing one's life in many ways when faced with the possibility of  death.  It is very important that  patients keep up hope while they adjust to the return of cancer. Some patients keep up hope through their <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000441265">spirituality</GlossaryTermRef> or religious beliefs.

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
