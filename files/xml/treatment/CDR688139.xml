    <Question>What is the history of the medical use of <ScientificName>Cannabis</ScientificName>?</Question>
    <Answer>
     <Para id="_8"> The use of <ScientificName>Cannabis</ScientificName>  for medicinal purposes dates back at least 3,000 years. It came into use in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454743">Western medicine</GlossaryTermRef> in the 19th century and was said to  relieve pain, inflammation, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463733">spasms</GlossaryTermRef>, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000694456">convulsions</GlossaryTermRef>.  </Para><Para id="_52">In 1937, the U.S. Treasury began taxing  <ScientificName>Cannabis</ScientificName> under the Marijuana Tax Act at one dollar per <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000330174">ounce</GlossaryTermRef> for medicinal use and one hundred dollars per ounce for recreational use. The American Medical Association (AMA) opposed this regulation of  <ScientificName>Cannabis</ScientificName> and did not want studies of its potential medicinal benefits to be limited. In 1942, <ScientificName>Cannabis</ScientificName> was removed from the U.S. <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000285980">Pharmacopoeia</GlossaryTermRef>  because of continuing concerns about its safety. In 1951, Congress passed the Boggs Act, which included <ScientificName>Cannabis</ScientificName> with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044691">narcotic</GlossaryTermRef> drugs for the first time. </Para><Para id="_53">Under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, marijuana  was classified as a Schedule I drug. Other Schedule I drugs include <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000641798">heroin</GlossaryTermRef>, LSD, mescaline, methaqualone, and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB).</Para><Para id="_30">Although <ScientificName>Cannabis</ScientificName> was not believed to have any  medicinal use, the U.S. government distributed it to  patients on a case-by-case basis under the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046526">Compassionate Use</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000762975">Investigational New Drug</GlossaryTermRef> (IND) program between 1978 and 1992.  </Para>
    <Para id="_32"> In the past 20 years, researchers have studied how cannabinoids act on  the brain and other parts of the body.

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_2"><Title>General CAM Information</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_3">Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also referred to as integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_4">Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_5">Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. </Para></SummarySection> 
  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_6"><Title>Evaluation of CAM Approaches</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_7">It is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute  and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_8">Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH)  in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.</Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_9"><ExternalRef xref="http://cam.cancer.gov/cam/best_case_intro.html">The NCI Best Case Series Program</ExternalRef>   which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.</Para></SummarySection>
