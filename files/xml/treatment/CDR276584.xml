Weight loss has been identified as an indicator of poor prognosis in cancer patients.<Reference refidx="2"/>  It has been shown that at the time of diagnosis, 80% of patients with upper gastrointestinal cancer and 60% of patients with lung cancer have already experienced a significant weight loss,<Reference refidx="3"/> generally defined as at least a 10% loss of body weight in 6 months' time.<Reference refidx="4"/>  Good nutrition practices can help cancer patients maintain weight and the body's nutrition stores, offering relief from nutrition impact symptoms and improving quality of life.<Reference refidx="5"/>    Poor nutrition practices, which can lead to undernutrition, can contribute to the incidence and severity of treatment side effects and increase the risk of infection, thereby reducing chances for survival.<Reference refidx="6"/> Nutrition impact symptoms are those symptoms that impede oral intake.  They include, but are not limited to, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, stomatitis, mucositis, dysphagia, alterations in taste and smell, pain, depression, and anxiety.<Reference refidx="7"/>     Early recognition and detection of risk  for malnutrition through nutrition screening followed by comprehensive assessments is increasingly recognized as imperative in the development of standards of quality of care in oncology practices.<Reference refidx="2"/> Undesirable weight gain may be an effect of chemotherapy treatment  for  early-stage cancers,  possibly resulting from decreases in resting metabolism.<Reference refidx="8"/> Consequently, the eating practices of individuals diagnosed with cancer should be assessed throughout the continuum of care to reflect the changing goals of nutritional therapy.</Para><Para id="_7">Nutritional status is often jeopardized by the natural progression of neoplastic disease. (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000276584#_4" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/appetite-loss/nutrition-hp-pdq">Tumor-Induced Effects on Nutritional Status</SummaryRef> section.)  Alterations in nutritional status begin at diagnosis, when psychosocial issues may also adversely affect dietary intake, and proceed through treatment and recovery.  Protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) is the most common secondary diagnosis in individuals diagnosed with cancer, stemming from the inadequate intake of carbohydrate, protein, and fat to meet metabolic requirements and/or the reduced absorption of macronutrients.  PCM in cancer results from multiple factors most often associated with anorexia, cachexia, and the early satiety sensation frequently experienced by individuals with cancer.  These factors range from altered tastes to a physical inability to ingest or digest food, leading to reduced nutrient intake.  Cancer-induced abnormalities in the metabolism of the major nutrients also increase the incidence of PCM.  Such abnormalities may include glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, increased lipolysis, and increased whole-body protein turnover. If left untreated, PCM can lead to progressive wasting, weakness, and debilitation as protein synthesis is reduced and lean body mass is lost, possibly leading to death.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_9">Anorexia, the loss of appetite or desire to eat, is typically present in 15% to 25% of all cancer patients at diagnosis and may also occur as a side effect of treatments.  Anorexia is an almost universal side effect in individuals with widely metastatic disease <Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/>  because of physiologic alterations in metabolism during carcinogenesis. (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000276584#_4" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/appetite-loss/nutrition-hp-pdq">Tumor-Induced Effects on Nutritional Status</SummaryRef> section.)  Anorexia can be exacerbated by chemotherapy and radiation therapy side effects such as taste and smell changes, nausea, and vomiting.  Surgical procedures, including esophagectomy and gastrectomy, may produce early satiety, a premature feeling of fullness.<Reference refidx="4"/>  Depression, loss of personal interests or hope, and anxious thoughts may be enough to bring about anorexia and result in PCM.<Reference refidx="3"/> Evidence-based recommendations have been published describing various approaches to the problems of cancer-related fatigue, anorexia, depression, and dyspnea.<Reference refidx="12"/> Other systemic or local effects of cancer or its treatment that may affect nutritional status include hypermetabolism, sepsis, malabsorption, and obstructions.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_10">Anorexia can hasten the course of cachexia,<Reference refidx="3"/> a progressive wasting syndrome evidenced by weakness and a marked and progressive loss of body weight, fat, and muscle.  Cachexia is estimated to be the immediate cause of death in 20% to 40% of cancer patients; it can develop in individuals who appear to be eating adequate calories and protein but have primary cachexia whereby tumor-related factors prevent maintenance of fat and muscle. Particularly at risk are patients with diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.</Para><Para id="_11">The etiology of cancer cachexia is not entirely understood.  Cachexia can manifest in individuals with metastatic cancer as well as in individuals with localized disease.  Several theories suggest that cachexia is caused by a complex mix of variables, including tumor-produced factors and metabolic abnormalities.<Reference refidx="11"/>      The basal metabolic rate in cachectic individuals is not adaptive, that is, it may be increased, decreased, or normal.<Reference refidx="13"/>   Some individuals do respond to nutrition therapy, but most will not see a complete reversal of the syndrome, even with aggressive therapy.<Reference refidx="6"/> Thus, the most prudent and 
advantageous approach to cachexia is the prevention of its initiation through nutrition monitoring and nutrition intervention.<Reference refidx="14"/>  </Para><Para id="_12">Reference citations in some PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care information summaries may include links to external Web sites that are operated by individuals or organizations for the purpose of marketing or advocating the use of specific treatments or products.

Also known as cachexia, this condition is one  of advanced protein-calorie malnutrition and is characterized by involuntary weight loss, muscle wasting, and decreased quality of life.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>  Tumor-induced weight loss occurs frequently in patients with solid tumors of the lung, pancreas, and upper gastrointestinal tract and less often in patients with breast cancer or lower gastrointestinal cancer.  Although anorexia may also be present,  the energy deficit alone does not explain the pathogenesis of cachexia. Several factors have been proposed.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Mediators including cytokines, neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, and tumor-derived factors are postulated to contribute to this syndrome.<Reference refidx="4"/>  Products of host tissues, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, interferon-γ, and leukemia inhibitor factor, as well as tumor products that have a direct catabolic effect on host tissues, such as lipid-mobilizing factor and proteolysis-inducing factor (not established as definite in humans), have all been identified as mediators of this complex syndrome.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Altered metabolism of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates is evident in cancer patients with cachexia.  Tumors may induce impaired glucose uptake and glucose oxidation, leading to an increased glycolysis.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Weight loss can occur from a decrease in energy intake, an increase in energy expenditure, or a combination of the two.  Although anorexia is a common symptom of  cancer patients, studies have shown that increased caloric intake either by the oral route or by supplementation with total parenteral nutrition has failed to counteract the wasting process.  This supports the theory that the aberrant metabolic rate is the direct response by the tumor and the immune system to disrupt the pathways that regulate the homeostatic loop of body-weight regulation.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_13">Current studies suggest that the basal metabolic rate serves as a possible prognostic indicator of survival.  As cancer progresses, the basal metabolic rate declines and cachexia occurs, reducing long-term survival.<Reference refidx="6"/>   Although alterations in overall basal metabolic rates have not been observed by some,<Reference refidx="7"/> increased basal metabolic rates have been reported in pediatric,<Reference refidx="8"/> breast,<Reference refidx="9"/> lung,<Reference refidx="8"/> malnourished,<Reference refidx="10"/> and other <Reference refidx="11"/> cancer patient populations; however, the discrepancy may be related to the stage of cancer progression.<Reference refidx="12"/> Nutritional support therapies aimed at preserving lean muscle mass and subcutaneous adipose stores despite this altered metabolic rate may ultimately improve patients' quality of life and impact overall survival.</Para><Para id="_14">Although an individual’s nutritional status may be compromised initially by the diagnosis of cancer, thorough nutritional screening procedures and the timely implementation of nutritional therapies may markedly improve the patient’s outcome. Symptoms and side effects may sometimes  be managed by a combination of dietary and pharmacologic interventions.</Para><Para id="_353">Several approaches to the treatment of cancer cachexia have been reported, and a variety of agents have been studied for their effects on appetite and weight.  The decision to use pharmacological treatment to improve a patient’s appetite should be based on the patient’s desires, current medical condition, and life expectancy.   <SummaryRef href="CDR0000276584#_411" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/appetite-loss/nutrition-hp-pdq">Table 1</SummaryRef> lists several medications that have been proposed to treat the symptoms of cancer cachexia.<Reference refidx="13"/> However, the management of cachexia remains a complex challenge, and integrated multimodal treatment targeting the different factors involved has been proposed.  In a  phase III study, patients were randomly assigned to receive megestrol acetate, eicosapentaenoic acid, L-carnitine, thalidomide, or megestrol acetate plus L-carnitine and thalidomide.  Interim analysis of 125 patients suggested the most effective treatment would be a combination regimen.  The optimal combination is the goal of ongoing research.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para><Table id="_411"><Title>Table 1.

Not everyone begins therapy with anorexia, weight loss, and other symptoms of nutritional problems.  For patients who have such symptoms, however, anticancer therapies can complicate the treatment and expected recovery.  Many individuals also present with preexisting comorbid diseases and illnesses that further complicate their treatment.  Surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation can have a direct (or mechanical) and/or an indirect (or metabolic) negative effect on nutritional status.  The success of the anticancer therapy will be influenced by a patient’s ability to tolerate therapy, which will, in turn, be affected by nutritional status preceding treatment.  The treating clinician should assess baseline nutritional status (see  the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000276584#_50" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/appetite-loss/nutrition-hp-pdq">Nutrition Screening and Assessment</SummaryRef> section) and be aware of the possible implications of the various therapies.

Clinicians should anticipate additional complicating factors such as the side effects of combined modality therapy (chemotherapy and radiation therapy),<Reference refidx="4"/> as well as the increased nutritional requirements for withstanding these therapies. Because head and neck cancer patients are often malnourished at diagnosis and will undergo therapies that may directly affect their ability to eat, many of these individuals have enteral feeding tubes placed prophylactically before undergoing surgery.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_24"><Title>Gastrointestinal cancers</Title><Para id="_25">Surgery may take a tremendous toll on the body, but it has reduced mortality and morbidity from gastrointestinal cancers.<Reference refidx="2"/>    Anticancer therapy for aerodigestive cancers (e.g., esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, liver, gallbladder, bile duct, and small and large intestine) can result in gastric paresis, alterations in digestion, malabsorption of nutrients, hyperglycemia, elevated lipid levels, hepatic encephalopathy, fluid and electrolyte imbalance, anastomotic and chyle leaks, dumping syndrome, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies.<Reference refidx="2"/> The use of enteral nutritional support is common in the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers. The feeding tube may be placed in the stomach (gastrostomy) or down into the jejunum (jejunostomy).<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="5"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_26"><Title>Additional complications and side effects from surgical oncology</Title><Para id="_27">Many individuals experience fatigue, pain, and loss of appetite and are unable to consume their regular diet as the result of surgery.<Reference refidx="2"/>    Prompt nutritional therapy can help relieve or reduce these problems. Avoiding carbonated or known gas-producing foods will help, as will altering the fiber content in the diet to encourage bowel regularity.  A well-balanced diet that contains the recommended amounts of essential nutrients and calories will help promote good wound healing.  Finally, proper nutrition and adequate rest may help prevent or treat fatigue.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_28"><Title>Chemotherapy</Title><Para id="_29">In 2000, more than 90 different chemotherapy agents were approved for use. These agents are divided into several functional categories.  Chemotherapy agents can be used in combination or as single agents, depending on the disease type and health condition of the individual.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_30">Unlike surgery and radiation therapy, cancer chemotherapy is a systemic treatment (not a localized treatment) that affects the whole body (not just a specific part).<Reference refidx="7"/>   Consequently, there are potentially more side effects with chemotherapy than with surgery and radiation therapy. The most commonly experienced nutrition-related side effects are anorexia, taste changes, early satiety, nausea, vomiting, mucositis/esophagitis, diarrhea, and constipation (see the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000276584#_117" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/appetite-loss/nutrition-hp-pdq">Nutritional Suggestions for Symptom Management</SummaryRef> section).  Because side effects of chemotherapy, as well as the cancer itself, can greatly affect nutritional status, healthcare providers need to anticipate possible problems and educate the patient about them <Reference refidx="7"/>  in an effort to prevent malnutrition and weight loss (see the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000276584#_50" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/appetite-loss/nutrition-hp-pdq">Nutrition Screening and Assessment</SummaryRef> section).  Malnutrition and weight loss can affect a patient’s ability to regain health and acceptable blood counts between chemotherapy cycles; this can directly affect the patient's ability to stay on treatment schedules, which is important in achieving a successful outcome.</Para><Para id="_31">Nutritional support or high-calorie/high-protein liquid supplements may be used in an effort to maintain adequate calorie and nutrient intake. Special formulas are available for people with secondary medical conditions such as hyperglycemia or compromised renal function. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_32"><Title>Radiation Therapy</Title><Para id="_33">Nutritional support during radiation therapy is vital.  The effect of radiation therapy on healthy tissue in the treatment field can produce changes in normal physiologic function that may ultimately diminish a patient’s nutritional status by interfering with ingestion, digestion, or absorption of nutrients. Medications such as pilocarpine (Salagen) may be useful in treating the xerostomia (dry mouth) that accompanies radiation therapy.  This medicine may reduce the need for artificial saliva agents or other oral comfort agents such as hard candy or sugarless gum.</Para><Para id="_34">The side effects of radiation therapy depend on the area irradiated, total dose, fractionation, duration, and volume irradiated.  Most side effects are acute, begin around the second or third week of treatment, and diminish 2 or 3 weeks after radiation therapy is completed.  Some side effects can be chronic and continue or occur after treatment has been completed.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_35">Individuals receiving radiation therapy to any part of the gastrointestinal tract are more susceptible to nutrition-related side effects.<Reference refidx="9"/>  Patients most at risk for developing nutrition-related side effects are those whose cancers involve the aerodigestive tract, including the head and neck, lungs, esophagus, cervix, uterus, colon, rectum, and pancreas.  Patients who are receiving radiation therapy to the head and neck region may present to radiation therapy with preexisting malnutrition secondary to an inability to ingest foods because of the disease itself or because of surgery to treat the disease.  Many of these patients have a history of high alcohol intake, which also places them at a higher nutritional risk.  These individuals are generally at the greatest risk for developing significant nutrition problems and severe weight loss.<Reference refidx="10"/> In a placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized study of 57 patients receiving radiation therapy for head/neck and lung cancer, megestrol acetate (MA) was administered at a dose of 800 mg per day.  Patients who received MA demonstrated significant advantages in weight maintenance and some aspects of quality of life.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_36">Nutrition intervention is based on symptom management.  Patients who maintain good nutrition are more likely to tolerate the side effects of treatment.  Adequate calories and protein can help maintain patient strength and prevent body tissues from further catabolism.  Individuals who do not consume adequate calories and protein use stored nutrients as an energy source, which leads to protein wasting and further weight loss.</Para><Para id="_37">Some of the more common nutrition-related side effects caused by irradiation to the head and neck include taste alterations or aversions, odynophagia (pain produced by swallowing), xerostomia, thick saliva, mucositis,  dysphagia, and stricture of the upper esophagus.<Reference refidx="4"/>   Thoracic irradiation may be associated with esophagitis, dysphagia, or esophageal reflux.  Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, enteritis, and malabsorption of nutrients are possible side effects of pelvic or abdominal radiation.<Reference refidx="12"/>  (See the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000276584#_117" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/appetite-loss/nutrition-hp-pdq">Nutritional Suggestions for Symptom Management</SummaryRef> section.) A prospective, randomized study of patients with colorectal cancer receiving radiation therapy demonstrated that concurrent individualized dietary counseling can  improve patients' nutritional intake, status, and quality of life.  These improvements, in turn, may reduce radiation-induced morbidity.<Reference refidx="13"/> Patients receiving high-dose radiation or bone marrow transplant should consult with a dietician.</Para><Para id="_38">Suggestions for appropriate dietary modifications based on nutrition-related symptoms are widely available for patient and healthcare professional use.  For a full listing of dietary suggestions see the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000276584#_4" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/appetite-loss/nutrition-hp-pdq">Tumor-Induced Effects on Nutritional Status</SummaryRef> section.  A list of appropriate references is also included below.</Para><Para id="_39">Many patients who are undergoing radiation therapy will benefit from nutritional supplements between meals.<Reference refidx="14"/>  Aggressive nutritional support is indicated when oral intake alone fails to maintain an individual’s weight.  Tube feedings are used more frequently than parenteral nutrition, primarily to preserve gastrointestinal function.  Tube feedings are usually well tolerated, pose less risk to the patient than parenteral feedings, and are more cost effective.  Numerous studies demonstrate the benefit of enteral feedings initiated at the onset of treatment, specifically treatment to head and neck regions, before significant weight loss has occurred.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/></Para><Para id="_40">Many nutrition-related side effects result from radiation therapy.  Quality of life and nutritional intake can be improved by managing these side effects through appropriate medical nutritional therapy and dietary modifications.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_41"><Title>Immunotherapy</Title><Para id="_42">Monoclonal antibodies, which are used to block cancer-cell receptors for growth-stimulating factors, may cause a cascade of symptoms; however, the symptoms most likely to impact nutritional status are fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.<Reference refidx="18"/>   Interferon (a nonspecific immunotherapy) has had the noted nutrition-related side effects of anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.<Reference refidx="18"/>    Interleukin-2, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the single-agent treatment of metastatic renal cell cancer, can also cause symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/>   Response to interleukin-2 treatment varies; some patients gain weight, and some require nutritional support.<Reference refidx="19"/>   However, most patients taking interleukin gain weight.    Finally, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, a very common therapy used to increase the production of white blood cells, may also cause fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.<Reference refidx="18"/></Para><Para id="_43">If ignored, these symptoms can cause gradual or drastic weight loss (depending on the severity of the symptoms), which may lead to malnutrition.  Malnutrition can complicate the expected healing and recovery process (see the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000276584#_117" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/appetite-loss/nutrition-hp-pdq">Nutritional Suggestions for Symptom Management</SummaryRef> section).</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_44"><Title>Hemopoietic and Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation </Title><Para id="_45">Hemopoietic and stem cell transplant patients have special nutritional requirements.<Reference refidx="20"/>    Before their transplant, patients receive high-dose chemotherapy and may also be treated with total-body irradiation (TBI).<Reference refidx="21"/>   These treatments, in addition to medications used during transplantation, frequently result in nutritional side effects, which may affect patients' ability to consume an adequate diet.  The goal of nutritional support should be the maintenance of nutritional status and protein stores.  In addition, transplant patients are at very high risk for neutropenia, an abnormally small number of neutrophils in the blood, that makes them susceptible to multiple infections.<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/></Para><Para id="_46">To reduce the risk of infections related to stem cell transplantation, most healthcare setting guidelines recommend only cooked and processed foods and restrict raw vegetables and fresh fruits that could cause a food-related infection.  Specific dietary restrictions and their duration depend on the type of transplant and the cancer site.  In addition to specific dietary restrictions, food safety guidelines should be reviewed and stressed with all transplant patients.</Para><Para id="_47">The chemotherapy regimen and complications associated with the transplant may result in numerous problems that adversely affect nutritional intake and status.<Reference refidx="24"/>   During the transplant process, patients may experience nutrition-related side effects such as taste changes, oral dryness, thick saliva, mouth and throat sores, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, lack of appetite/weight loss, and weight gain.  Often during the first few weeks posttransplant, patients are fed intravenously to ensure that they receive sufficient calories, protein, vitamins, minerals, and fluids.<Reference refidx="25"/></Para><Para id="_48">Many patients experience mouth and throat sores 2 to 4 weeks after transplantation.  Mucositis is the general term that refers to the erythema, swelling, and ulceration of the intraoral soft-tissue structures and the oral and esophageal mucosa in response to the cytotoxic effect of radiation therapy and high-dose chemotherapy.  Mouth and throat sores can make eating and swallowing difficult.  TBI may also cause dryness of the mouth, temporarily alter the taste of food, and/or cause thick saliva to form in the mouth and throat.  Nausea and vomiting are common problems experienced by transplant patients.  Nausea and vomiting may be caused by TBI, chemotherapy, and some medications.  TBI, chemotherapy, infection, depression, and fatigue can cause a decrease in appetite and weight loss.  Lack of appetite may continue to be a problem long after discharge from the hospital.  Patients may also experience gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea and constipation that could be caused by TBI, chemotherapy, gastrointestinal graft-versus-host disease, infection, and some medications.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">American Cancer Society: A Guide to Cancer Surgery.

Caution should be exercised when considering alternative or unproven nutritional therapies during all phases of cancer treatment and supportive palliation, as these diets may prove harmful.  Patient nutritional status plays an integral role in determining not only risk of developing cancer but also risk of therapy-related toxicity and medical outcomes.  Whether the goal of cancer treatment is cure or palliation, early detection of nutritional problems and prompt intervention are essential. </Para><Para id="_52">The original principles of nutrition care for people diagnosed with cancer were developed  in 1979 <Reference refidx="1"/> and are still very relevant today.  Proactive nutritional care can prevent or reduce the complications typically associated with the treatment of cancer.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_53">Many nutritional problems stem from local effects of the tumor.  Tumors in the gastrointestinal tract, for example, can cause obstruction, nausea, vomiting, impaired digestion, and/or malabsorption.  In addition to the effects of the tumor, marked alterations in normal metabolism of carbohydrates, protein, and/or fats can occur.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_54">The nutritional prognostic indicators most recognized as being predictive of poor outcome include weight loss, wasting, and malnutrition.

Examples of these tools include the Prognostic Nutrition Index,<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/> delayed hypersensitivity skin testing, institution-specific guidelines, and anthropometrics.  Each of these tools can help identify persons at nutritional risk; unfortunately, the values obtained using such tools can be altered by the hydration status and the immune compromise frequently found in individuals diagnosed with cancer. In addition, each of these objective measures can carry a cost in terms of laboratory or practitioner time.    One author has provided a useful overview of assessment procedures for advanced cancer patients.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_58">Another example of a screening and assessment procedure is the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA).

Enteral nutrition is indicated when the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is functional but oral intake is insufficient to meet nutritional requirements.  Common situations in which enteral nutrition may be needed include malignancies of the head and neck regions, esophagus, and stomach.  When the GI tract is dysfunctional, total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or enteral nutrition may be indicated; however, the widespread use of TPN is controversial because little evidence of improved survival has been demonstrated in patients with advanced cancer.<Reference refidx="21"/> Parenteral nutrition has been shown to be beneficial in only a small group of patients—specifically, postoperative patients who are being aggressively treated and who have demonstrated a positive response rate.  One study <Reference refidx="22"/> reported that patients with  GI cancer benefited from perioperative support with TPN, with one-third fewer complications and decreased mortality.</Para><SummarySection id="_362"><Title>Oral nourishment</Title><Para id="_371">Optimal nutrition can improve the clinical course, outcome, and quality of life of patients undergoing treatment for cancer.<Reference refidx="23"/>   Virtually every cancer patient could benefit from consultation with a  registered dietitian or physician to formulate a plan for nutrition and to begin meal planning.  Oral nutrition, or eating by mouth, is the preferred method of feeding and should be used whenever possible.  Appetite stimulants may be used to enhance the enjoyment of foods and to facilitate weight gain in the presence of significant anorexia.<Reference refidx="24"/></Para><Para id="_372">Recommendations during treatment may focus on eating foods that are high in energy, protein, and micronutrients to help maintain nutritional status.  This may be especially true for individuals with early satiety, anorexia, and alteration in taste, xerostomia, mucositis, nausea, or diarrhea.  Under most of these circumstances, eating frequently and including high-energy and high-protein snacks may help overall intake.<Reference refidx="25"/></Para><Para id="_374">At-risk individuals who may benefit from nutritional support might have one or more of the following characteristics:<Reference refidx="26"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_375" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Low body weight, as defined by less than 80% of ideal weight or recently experienced unintentional weight loss of more than 10% of usual weight.</ListItem><ListItem>Malabsorption of nutrients due to disease, short bowel syndrome, or anticancer therapy.</ListItem><ListItem>Fistulas or draining abscesses.</ListItem><ListItem>Inability to eat or drink for more than 5 days.</ListItem><ListItem>Moderate or high nutritional risk status as determined by screening or an assessment tool.</ListItem><ListItem>The ability to demonstrate competencies for discharge planning on nutritional support (both individual and caregiver).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_376">Although the many benefits of achieving good nutritional status via nutritional support can clearly be detailed, the disadvantages or questionable benefits of nutritional support must also be considered. The debate regarding the effect of nutritional support on tumor growth has not been settled;<Reference refidx="27"/> though quality of life is usually improved with better nutritional status, the actual impact of nutritional support on longevity has yet to be definitively determined.<Reference refidx="27"/></Para><Para id="_377">Once the degree of malnutrition has been assessed, the decision to offer nutritional support and which form of support to utilize must be determined by the healthcare professional and other parties involved. Enteral and parenteral nutritional support offers viable options to reduce the risk of debilitating malnutrition and interruptions in anticancer therapy that may influence outcome.  Each form of nutritional support has advantages and disadvantages.  It is critical to thoroughly evaluate the diagnosis, prognosis, degree of malnutrition, function of the gut, and ease of delivery before embarking on the plan of nutritional support.  Caution must also be exercised to avoid refeeding syndrome, the metabolic complication that is caused by rapid repletion of potassium, phosphorous, and magnesium in a severely malnourished or cachectic patient.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para><Para id="_378">The following sections highlight the benefits, contraindications, methods of administration, formulas, and home care issues for both enteral and parenteral nutrition.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_77"><Title>Enteral nutrition</Title><Para id="_78">The benefits of enteral nutrition, or tube feeding, are that it continues to use the gut, has fewer complications such as infection and organ malfunction, is often easier to administer, and is cheaper than parenteral nutrition.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/> In addition, nutrients are metabolized and utilized more efficiently by the body.</Para><Para id="_79">Specific disease and condition-related indications for use consist of a diagnosis of a cancer of the alimentary canal (in particular, head and neck, esophageal, gastric, or pancreatic cancers) and severe complications/side effects from chemotherapy and/or radiation that are seriously jeopardizing the treatment plan of an individual already suffering from malnutrition.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para><Para id="_80">Contraindications for enteral nutritional support include a malfunctioning gastrointestinal tract, malabsorptive conditions, mechanical obstructions, severe bleeding, severe diarrhea, intractable vomiting, gastrointestinal fistulas in locations difficult to bypass with an enteral tube, inflammatory bowel processes such as prolonged ileus and severe enterocolitis, and/or an overall health prognosis not consistent with aggressive nutrition therapy.<Reference refidx="26"/> Thrombocytopenia and general pancytopenic conditions following anticancer treatments may also prevent placement of an enteral tube.</Para><Para id="_81"><Strong>Prospective Assessment</Strong></Para><Para id="_82">Several effective methods for the delivery of enteral nutritional support or tube feedings exist. An approximation of how long nutritional support will be needed is critical, however, to determine the most appropriate delivery route.  Nasogastric, nasoduodenal, or nasojejunal methods are best for short-term support (&lt;2 weeks).<Reference refidx="29"/>   The endpoint of delivery—the stomach, the duodenum, or jejunum—is determined by the risk of aspiration, with nasojejunal feeds recommended for individuals with aspiration risk.  If the person with cancer is at very high risk for aspiration, enteral nutritional support may be contraindicated and parenteral nutrition should be considered.  Also, immune-compromised individuals with mucositis, esophagitis, and/or herpetic, fungal, or candidiasis lesions in the mouth or throat may not be able to tolerate the presence of a nasogastrointestinal tube.</Para><Para id="_83">Tubes are constructed from silicone or polyurethane and can vary in length from 30 to 43 inches, with the shorter tubes used for nasogastric feedings.  The diameters range from  5F to 16F catheters.  Tubes may have weighted tips to help passage through the gut.</Para><Para id="_84">Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes (PEGs) and percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy tubes (PEJs) are generally used for long-term enteral feedings (&gt;2 weeks).<Reference refidx="29"/>   The placement further down in the gastrointestinal tract has a number of advantages: the diameter of the tube is larger (15F-24F catheters), which allows easier and faster passage of formulas and medications; the risk for aspiration is lower because of the decreased chance of migration of the tube up into the esophagus; the risk for sinusitis or nasoesophageal erosion is lower; and this route is more convenient and aesthetically pleasing to the individual because of the ability to conceal the tube.<Reference refidx="29"/>   People anticipating long-term support may also consider a skin-level button gastrostomy or jejunostomy. </Para><Para id="_85">Assessment of need and ease of delivery are best done early.

It is important to drink even if not thirsty, as the thirst sensation is not a good indicator of fluid needs.</ListItem><ListItem>Add food to the diet that contains a significant portion of fluid, such as soup, flavored ice pops, flavored ices, and gelatins.</ListItem><ListItem>	Limit consumption of caffeine-containing products, including colas and other caffeinated sodas, coffee, and tea (both hot and cold); these foods may not be as nourishing as noncaffeinated beverages.</ListItem><ListItem>	Drink most liquids after and/or  between meals to increase overall consumption of both liquids and solids.</ListItem><ListItem>Use antiemetics for relief from nausea and vomiting; antiemetic use can be very helpful and may prevent hospital admissions from dehydration.  The classes of available antiemetics include anticholinergics, phenothiazines, antihistamines, butyrophenones, benzamides, and serotonin receptor antagonists.  Of note, all of these antiemetics have side effects that many individuals would consider less problematic than nausea and vomiting.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_160"><Title>Constipation</Title><Para id="_161">Constipation is defined as fewer than three bowel movements per week.<Reference refidx="54"/>   It is a very common problem among individuals with cancer and may result from lack of adequate fluids or dehydration, lack of fiber in the diet, physical inactivity or immobility, anticancer therapies such as chemotherapy, and medications used in the treatment of side effects of anticancer therapy such as antiemetics and opioids.<Reference refidx="54"/><Reference refidx="55"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]  In addition, commonly used pharmacologic agents such as minerals (calcium, iron), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and antihypertensives can cause constipation.<Reference refidx="54"/></Para><Para id="_162">An effective bowel regimen should be in place before the problem of constipation occurs.

The goal of palliative care is to give relief of symptoms that are bothersome to the patient.  Although some of the symptoms listed above can be effectively treated, anorexia, though common, is a symptom that is often not noted as problematic for most terminally ill patients but is distressing to most family members; this distress may vary according to cultural factors.  Several studies have demonstrated that terminally ill patients lack hunger, and of those who did experience hunger, the symptom was relieved with small amounts of oral intake.<Reference refidx="5"/> </Para><Para id="_230">Decreased intake, especially of solid foods, is common as death becomes imminent.  Individuals usually prefer and tolerate soft-moist foods and refreshing liquids (full and clear liquids).  Those who have increased difficulty swallowing have less incidence of aspiration with thick liquids than with thin liquids.</Para><Para id="_231">Dietary restriction is not usually necessary, as intake of prohibited foods (e.g., sweets in the diabetic patient) is insufficient to be of concern.<Reference refidx="6"/>   As always, food should continue to be treated and viewed as a source of enjoyment and pleasure. Eating should not just be about calories, protein, and other macronutrient and micronutrient needs.</Para><Para id="_232">Diet restrictions are sometimes appropriate, however.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/>   For example, people with pancreatic cancer, gynecologic cancer, abdominal carcinomatosis, pelvic masses, or retroperitoneal lymph node masses may have bowel obstruction less frequently when adhering to a prophylactic soft diet (i.e., no raw fruits and vegetables, no nuts, no skins, no seeds).

For patients who still have good quality of life but also have mechanical or physiologic barriers to achieving adequate nourishment and hydration orally (e.g., head and neck cancer), prolonged survival may be achieved with the use of enteral or parenteral nutrition.<Reference refidx="5"/> In a qualitative study, 13 patients and 11 family members perceived some benefits with home parenteral nutrition.<Reference refidx="8"/> The most salient positive feature of home parenteral nutrition was a sense of relief and security that nutritional needs were met.  In this study, patients were also able to take oral nutrition, and the administration of total parenteral nutrition was often described as a complement to the patients' oral intake.  This contradicts the traditional indication for TPN, i.e., that its use be reserved for times when nourishment via the gastrointestinal tract is not possible.  Patients in this study also had regular visits by home health care providers, which could have had a positive impact on their physical, social, and psychological well-being.  </Para><Para id="_379">Although most patients with advanced cancer will not benefit from artificial nutrition, for someone who still has good quality of life but also has mechanical or physiologic barriers to achieving adequate nourishment and hydration orally (e.g., head and neck cancer), prolonged survival can be achieved with the use of enteral or parenteral nutrition.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_235">All people with cancer and their caregivers have the right to make informed decisions.

Survivors who engage in at-risk lifestyle behaviors are likely to accelerate the progression of some late effects. Given the increased vulnerability to disease among survivors of cancer, this group uniquely represents a high-risk population for whom intervention strategies can be optimally applied and tested. Interventions that educate survivors about modifying risky lifestyle behaviors and that promote self-efficacy may be effective strategies for lowering the risk of late effects.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_483"><Title>Intervention trials among survivors of cancer</Title><Para id="_484">The growing population of survivors has fueled awareness about the unique needs for effective lifestyle intervention programs specifically designed for survivors of cancer. As highlighted by the literature, most survivors of cancer are not following cancer prevention guidelines. A number of trials have aimed to modify lifestyle behaviors, with the goal of minimizing the risk of developing late effects or decreasing the odds of recurrence. A summary of select intervention studies is presented below.</Para><SummarySection id="_485"><Title>Breast cancer</Title><Para id="_486">The association between increased fat intake and increased breast cancer recurrence coupled with an increase in the survivor population among breast cancer patients led to the development of two National Cancer Institute–funded trials evaluating dietary patterns and the effects of dietary intake of fat on breast cancer recurrence.</Para><Para id="_487">The Women’s Intervention Nutrition Study (WINS) (N = 2,437) was the first large-scale trial that explored the effects of dietary intervention on survival, relapse, or recurrence in women with breast cancer.<Reference refidx="18"/> The primary outcome measure of this trial was the effect of a low-fat diet on relapse-free survival among women who were within 1 year of diagnosis with breast cancer. In this study, subjects were counseled to reduce fat intake to 15% of total energy intake while maintaining a nutritionally balanced diet. Exercise was not a component of the intervention.</Para><Para id="_488">WINS participants maintained a favorable response rate at year 1: 86% for the intervention group and 91% for the control group. However, at year 5 the response rate decreased to 39% for the intervention group and 44% for the control group. A significant reduction in weight loss was observed at months 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60, compared to baseline (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .0001).<Reference refidx="18"/></Para><Para id="_489">The study did not find that adoption of a low-fat diet had an effect on overall survival, relapse, or recurrence. An exploratory analysis revealed a beneficial effect among women with estrogen receptor–negative breast cancer. In this group, adherence to a low-fat diet increased relapse-free survival in the intervention group, compared with controls (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt;  .034).<Reference refidx="18"/> WINS was limited by its sole reliance on self-reported data and by most patients being white and having advanced degrees, thereby limiting the generalizability of the study.</Para><Para id="_490">The Women's Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) Study (N = 3,088) explored the effect of a dietary intervention promoting daily consumption of five vegetable servings plus 16 oz of vegetable juice, three fruit servings, and 30 g of fiber, with fat comprising 15% to 20% of energy intake.<Reference refidx="19"/> The primary outcome measures were cancer recurrence or new primary breast cancer and death from any cause.</Para><Para id="_491">The intervention arm included a series of telephone counseling sessions combined with 12 cooking classes held during the first year of the study, along with monthly newsletters tailored to the individuals. The control arm received education about the “5-A-Day” diet, attended an average of one of four cooking classes in the first year, and received 24 newsletters tailored to them. Objective data were also collected in this study. Plasma concentration of nutrients was obtained at 12, 48, and 72 months. Participants were monitored for 7 years, with response rates at 77.9% in the intervention arm and 86.2% in the control arm at 72 months.<Reference refidx="19"/></Para><Para id="_523">Participants in the intervention arm of the WHEL Study significantly increased their vegetable consumption, from 3.9 servings per day at baseline to 5.8 servings per day at 72 months. Fruit intake went from 3.5 to 3.4 servings per day.  The control arm reported decreased intake of fruits, from 3.4 to 2.6 servings per day, and of vegetables, from 3.8 to 3.6 servings per day. No significant effect on dietary fat intake as a percentage of total calories or fiber was observed in the intervention group.<Reference refidx="19"/> In concordance with WINS, no effect on overall survival or cancer recurrence was observed. A nested case-control analysis revealed that women who were hot flash negative at recruitment experienced a significantly decreased risk of cancer recurrence (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .002).<Reference refidx="20"/></Para><Para id="_524">While both WINS and the WHEL Study found that nutrition education can produce sustained dietary change among survivors of cancer, neither trial found significant effects on primary study outcomes. It is important to recognize that these studies evaluated slightly different questions.<Reference refidx="21"/> WINS focused more on the effects of a low-fat diet based on data correlating breast cancer with fat and circulating estrogen levels, while the WHEL Study evaluated a comprehensive diet change that included fruits, vegetables, decreased fat, and increased fiber.</Para><Para id="_525">These studies demonstrate that distance medicine–based nutrition education is effective at instituting change. However, the clinical benefit of these studies remains to be seen.

It is unknown whether the nutrition education interventions would be effective in ethnically diverse populations, low-income households, or individuals with low levels of education.</Para><Para id="_528">Only one study has explored the effects of a diet-plus-spirituality education intervention in a nonwhite population of survivors of breast cancer.<Reference refidx="22"/> The investigators hypothesized that the addition of a spiritual component would provide further support to dietary change. Participants were obese (BMI 30–45) African American women aged 18 to 70 years who had been diagnosed with breast cancer in the 10 years before recruitment. Individualized dietary counseling was provided by a registered dietician for 18 months. Counseling sessions were provided in person at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months, with interim telephone counseling. Participants also received coupons for free attendance at Weight Watchers meetings between visits to the registered dietician.<Reference refidx="22"/></Para><Para id="_529">Participant dietary and exercise goals included the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_531" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Decrease fat to 20% to 25% of calories.</ListItem><ListItem>Maintain protein at 20% of calories.</ListItem><ListItem>Choose whole grains for at least half of their daily grain intake.</ListItem><ListItem>Eat at least six to eight servings of fruits and vegetables daily.</ListItem><ListItem>Exercise for at least 30 minutes per day, at least 5 days per week.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_532">Spiritual counseling focused on issues relevant to weight loss and was conducted by telephone weekly for 3 months, biweekly for 3 months, and then monthly.

At month 6, 24 
subjects were randomly assigned to receive dietician-led counseling with or without spiritual counseling. Of the 24 women, 11 subjects in each arm completed the study.</Para><Para id="_533">No significant differences in weight loss were observed between the two groups.

The intervention group met weekly for 6 weeks, biweekly for 1 month, and then monthly thereafter.</Para><Para id="_494">The study's primary endpoint was weight change. Secondary endpoints were leisure activity and nutrition analysis, as measured by 3-day food records. Overall attrition to the study was 16%: 10% in the usual care group, compared with 22% in the intervention group. At 12 months, the intervention group had lost 3.5 kg, compared with a 1.4-kg gain in the usual care group (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .018).

However, although diet may not prevent breast cancer recurrence, the data do not refute the importance of a healthy diet for minimizing the development of nutrition-related late effects such as obesity, heart disease, and metabolic syndrome. When counseling survivors of breast cancer, nutrition educators should highlight the global benefits and importance of a healthy diet.
