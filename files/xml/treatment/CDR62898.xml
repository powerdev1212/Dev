The three major prognostic factors are
site (anal canal vs. perianal skin), size (primary tumors &lt;2
cm in size have better prognoses), and nodal status.
</Para><Para id="_3">Anal cancer is an uncommon malignancy and  accounts for only a small percentage
(4%) of all cancers of the lower alimentary tract.  Clinical trials such as  EST-7283R, for example, have
evaluated the roles of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery in the
treatment of this disease.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>  Information about ongoing clinical trials is

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_302"><Title>Risk Factors</Title><Para id="_4">Overall, the risk of anal cancer is rising with data suggesting that
persons engaging in certain sexual practices, such as receptive anal intercourse, or persons with a high lifetime number of sexual partners are at an  increased risk of anal cancer.  These practices may have led to an increase in the number of individuals at risk for infection with human papillomavirus (HPV); HPV infection is strongly associated with anal cancer development and may be a necessary step in its carcinogenesis.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/>

Chemotherapy with fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin concurrent with  lower-dose radiation therapy as utilized in the RTOG-8314 trial, for example,  has a 5-year
survival rate in excess of 70% with low levels of acute and chronic morbidity,

The optimal dose of radiation with concurrent chemotherapy to optimize local

A 9.1% increase in nonanal cancer deaths was seen in the first 5 years following chemoradiation, which was not seen after 10 years.<Reference refidx="14"/> </Para><Para id="_304">The choice of chemotherapy during concurrent chemoradiation has been the subject of several trials.  Analysis of an intergroup trial that
compared radiation therapy plus 5-FU  and MMC with radiation therapy
