cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team
of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during
childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following health care professionals and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
that will achieve optimal survival and quality of life:</Para><ItemizedList id="_595" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Primary care physicians.</ListItem><ListItem>Pediatric surgical subspecialists.</ListItem><ListItem>Radiation oncologists. </ListItem><ListItem>Pediatric medical oncologists/hematologists.</ListItem><ListItem>Rehabilitation specialists.</ListItem><ListItem>Pediatric nurse specialists.</ListItem><ListItem>Social workers.</ListItem><ListItem>Child life professionals.</ListItem><ListItem>Psychologists.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_936">(Refer to the PDQ <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/supportive-care">Supportive and Palliative Care</ExternalRef> summaries for specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer.)</Para><Para id="_224">Guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children with
cancer have been outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics.<Reference refidx="2"/>  At these
pediatric cancer centers, clinical trials are available for most of the
types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity to
participate in these trials is offered to most patients/families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents with cancer are generally designed to
compare therapy that is accepted as the best currently available therapy (standard therapy) with potentially better therapy.  Most of the progress made in identifying curative therapies
for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.  Information
about ongoing clinical trials is available from the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials">NCI
  website</ExternalRef>.
