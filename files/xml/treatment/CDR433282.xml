vaccine) of mothers infected with hepatitis B virus was associated with a reduction in the average annual incidence of HCC from 0.70 per 100,000 children between 1981 and 1986 to 0.57 and 0.36 for the time periods  of  1986 to      1990 and 1990 to 1994, respectively (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .01).<Reference refidx="1"/> Although there was no direct control group, the decline in incidence of HCC over time would unlikely be explained by other causes.

Although each disease can cause similar symptoms, the diseases have different modes of transmission and can affect the liver differently. </Para><Para id="_69">Hepatitis A appears only as an acute or newly occurring infection and does not become chronic. People with hepatitis A usually improve without treatment.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_70">Hepatitis B and hepatitis C can also begin as acute infections, but in some people, the virus remains in the body, resulting in chronic disease and long-term liver problems. There are vaccines to prevent hepatitis A and B; however, there is not a vaccine for hepatitis C. If a person has had one type of viral hepatitis in the past, it is still possible to get the other types.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_73">After the hepatitis A and hepatitis B viruses were discovered, neither agent was found responsible for many cases of transfusion-related hepatitis—hence the designation  non-A, non-B (NANB) hepatitis. Initial follow-up of these cases showed that approximately 50% of patients developed chronic hepatitis, based on persistence of serum enzymes for at least 6 months. Approximately 15 years later, after  HCV had been identified as the cause of NANB hepatitis, chronic hepatitis was found to develop more frequently as indicated by persistent viral infection in more than 80% of infected adults but in only about 50% of infected children or young women.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><SummarySection id="_55"><Title>Hepatitis A</Title><Para id="_56">Hepatitis A is caused by eating food and drinking water infected with  a virus called HAV.

Hepatitis C results from infection with HCV,   which is spread primarily through contact with the blood of an infected person. Hepatitis C can be either acute or chronic.<Reference refidx="10"/> Most people who have hepatitis C develop a chronic infection; this may lead to a scarring of the liver, called cirrhosis. Blood banks test all donated blood for both hepatitis B and hepatitis C, which greatly reduces the risk of getting the virus from blood transfusions or blood products.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_61"><Title>Hepatitis D</Title><Para id="_62">Hepatitis D is caused by the virus HDV. A person can only get hepatitis D if they are already infected with hepatitis B. It is spread through contact with infected blood, dirty needles,  and unprotected sex with a person infected with HDV.

In the United States, chronic hepatitis B and CHC account for about 30% to 40% of HCC. Long-term iron depletion in  CHC  patients has been studied as a modality for lowering the risk of progression to HCC.<Reference refidx="27"/>    Iron depletion improves serum alanine aminotransferase levels and hepatic oxidative DNA damage. In a cohort study of biopsy-proven CHC patients with moderate or severe liver fibrosis, patients were divided into two groups. Patients in group A (n = 35) underwent weekly phlebotomy (200 g) until they reached a state of mild iron deficiency, followed by monthly maintenance phlebotomy for 44 to    144 months (median, 107 months), and      were advised to consume a low-iron diet (5–7 mg iron/day).<Reference refidx="27"/>  Group B (n = 40) comprised CHC patients who declined to receive iron depletion therapy.  Both groups included patients who failed to respond to previous interferon (IFN) therapy or had conditions for which IFN was contraindicated.                     Hepatocarcinogenesis rates in groups A and B were 5.7% and 17.5% at the end of the fifth year and 8.6% and 39% in the tenth year, respectively.<Reference refidx="27"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_13"><Title>Cirrhosis and other factors</Title><Para id="_14">Cirrhosis is a risk factor for HCC, irrespective of the etiology of the cirrhosis.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/> The annual risk of developing HCC among persons with cirrhosis is between 1% and 6%.<Reference refidx="23"/>         Other risk factors include hemochromatosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, glycogen storage disease, porphyria cutanea tarda, tyrosinemia, and Wilson disease,<Reference refidx="2"/> but rarely biliary cirrhosis.<Reference refidx="28"/> Aflatoxins, which are mycotoxins formed by certain <ScientificName>Aspergillus</ScientificName> species, are a frequent contaminant of improperly stored grains and nuts. In parts of Africa, the high incidence of HCC in humans may be related to ingestion of foods contaminated with aflatoxins. This association, however, is blurred by the frequent coexistence of hepatitis B infection in those population groups. Heavy aflatoxin exposure is associated with inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, but epidemiological evidence of a causal association is limited.<Reference refidx="29"/> The likely etiology of HCC is summarized in <SummaryRef href="CDR0000433282#_17" url="/types/liver/hp/liver-prevention-pdq">Table 3</SummaryRef>.<Reference refidx="30"/></Para><Table id="_17"><Title>Table 3.
