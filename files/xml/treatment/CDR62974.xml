the use of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044190">cartilage</GlossaryTermRef> as a treatment
for people with  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef>.  The summary includes a brief history of cartilage research, the
results of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044195">clinical studies</GlossaryTermRef>, and
possible <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046580">side effects</GlossaryTermRef> of cartilage use.</Para><Para id="_3">This summary contains the following key information:</Para><ItemizedList id="_4" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Bovine (cow) cartilage and shark cartilage have been studied as
treatments for people with cancer and other medical conditions for more than 30
years.</ListItem>
         <ListItem>Numerous cartilage products are sold commercially in the United States
as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000373932">dietary supplements</GlossaryTermRef>.</ListItem>
         <ListItem>Three principal mechanisms of action have been proposed to explain the
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000446109">antitumor</GlossaryTermRef> potential of cartilage: (1) it kills cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046476">cells</GlossaryTermRef> directly; (2) it
stimulates the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356">immune system</GlossaryTermRef>; and (3) it blocks the formation of new <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045020">blood vessels</GlossaryTermRef>
(<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046529">angiogenesis</GlossaryTermRef>), which <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumors</GlossaryTermRef> need
for unrestricted growth.</ListItem>
         <ListItem>At least three different inhibitors of angiogenesis have been identified
in bovine cartilage, and two <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046739">angiogenesis inhibitors</GlossaryTermRef>
have been purified from shark cartilage.</ListItem>
         <ListItem>Few human studies  of cartilage as a treatment for people with cancer have been reported to date, and the results
are inconclusive.</ListItem>
         <ListItem>Additional <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045961">clinical trials</GlossaryTermRef>
of cartilage as a treatment for people with cancer are now being conducted.</ListItem>

the interest in cartilage as a treatment for people with cancer arose from the mistaken
belief that sharks, whose <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044221">skeletons</GlossaryTermRef> are
made primarily of cartilage, are not affected by this disease.<Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/>  Although reports of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045772">malignant</GlossaryTermRef> 
tumors in sharks are rare, a variety of cancers have been detected in these
animals.<Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/>  Nonetheless, several substances that have
antitumor activity have been identified in cartilage.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/><Reference refidx="35"/><Reference refidx="36"/><Reference refidx="37"/><Reference refidx="38"/><Reference refidx="39"/><Reference refidx="40"/><Reference refidx="41"/><Reference refidx="42"/><Reference refidx="43"/><Reference refidx="44"/><Reference refidx="45"/><Reference refidx="46"/><Reference refidx="47"/><Reference refidx="48"/><Reference refidx="49"/>  More than half a dozen <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044195">clinical studies</GlossaryTermRef> of cartilage as a

known as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044191">chondrocytes</GlossaryTermRef>) produce one
or more substances that inhibit blood vessel formation.<Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="35"/><Reference refidx="36"/><Reference refidx="48"/>  The formation of new blood vessels or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046529">angiogenesis</GlossaryTermRef> is
necessary for <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumors</GlossaryTermRef> to grow larger than a few <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044215">millimeters</GlossaryTermRef> in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044224">diameter</GlossaryTermRef> (i.e., larger than approximately
100,000 to 1,000,000 cells) because tumors, like normal tissues, must obtain
most of their oxygen and nutrients from blood.<Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/><Reference refidx="41"/><Reference refidx="51"/><Reference refidx="52"/><Reference refidx="53"/><Reference refidx="54"/>  A
developing tumor, therefore, cannot continue to grow unless it establishes
connections to the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044194">circulatory
system</GlossaryTermRef> of its host.  It has been reported that tumors can initiate the
process of angiogenesis when they contain as few as 100 cells.<Reference refidx="53"/>  Inhibition
of angiogenesis at this early <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045885">stage</GlossaryTermRef> may,
in some instances, lead to complete tumor <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046039">regression</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="53"/>  The possibility that
cartilage could be a source of one or more types of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046739">angiogenesis inhibitors</GlossaryTermRef>
for the treatment of cancer has prompted much research.</Para><Para id="_8">The major structural components of cartilage include several types of the 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046092">protein</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044196">collagen</GlossaryTermRef> and several types of
 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044206">glycosaminoglycans</GlossaryTermRef>, which are 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044162">polysaccharides</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="39"/><Reference refidx="48"/><Reference refidx="54"/><Reference refidx="55"/>          <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044192">Chondroitin sulfate</GlossaryTermRef> is the
major glycosaminoglycan in cartilage.<Reference refidx="39"/><Reference refidx="54"/>  Although there is no
evidence that the collagens in cartilage, or their breakdown products, can
inhibit angiogenesis, there is evidence that shark cartilage contains at least
one angiogenesis inhibitor that has a glycosaminoglycan component (refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062974#_23" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/cartilage-pdq">Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information).<Reference refidx="46"/>  Other data indicate that
most of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044186">antiangiogenic</GlossaryTermRef> 
activity in cartilage is not associated with the major structural components.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="48"/></Para><Para id="_9">Some glycosaminoglycans in cartilage reportedly have <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044187">anti-inflammatory</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356">immune-system</GlossaryTermRef>-stimulating properties,<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="56"/><Reference refidx="57"/> and it has been
suggested that either they or some of their breakdown products are toxic to
tumor cells.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="24"/>  Thus, the antitumor potential of cartilage
may involve more than one mechanism of action.</Para><Para id="_10">Cartilage products are sold commercially in the United States as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000373932">dietary
supplements</GlossaryTermRef>.  More than 40 different brand names of shark cartilage alone are
available to consumers.<Reference refidx="17"/>  In the United States, dietary
supplements are regulated as foods, not drugs.  Therefore, premarket
evaluation and approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are not
required unless specific disease prevention or treatment claims are made. 
Because manufacturers of cartilage products are not required to show evidence
of anticancer or other biologic effects, it is unclear whether
any of these products have <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043985">therapeutic</GlossaryTermRef> potential.  In addition,
individual products may vary considerably from lot to lot because standard
manufacturing processes do not exist, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044189">binding agents</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044205">fillers</GlossaryTermRef> may be added during
production.<Reference refidx="17"/>     The FDA has not approved the use of cartilage as a treatment for people with cancer or any other medical condition. The FDA is notifying consumers of a refund program for purchasers of Lane Labs-USA, Inc.'s shark cartilage product, BeneFin. Consumers are eligible for a partial refund of the purchase price and any shipping and handling costs if this  product was purchased between September 22, 1999 and July 12, 2004.</Para><Para id="_11">To conduct clinical drug research in the United States, researchers must
file an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044763">Investigational</GlossaryTermRef> New Drug (IND) application with the FDA.  To date, IND
status has been granted to at least four groups of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044685">investigators</GlossaryTermRef>,  one of which was the MDA-ID-99303 trial, that is now closed, to study
cartilage as a treatment for people with cancer.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="58"/>  Because the
IND application process is confidential and because the existence of an IND
can be disclosed only by the applicants, it is not known whether other
applications have been made.</Para><Para id="_12">In <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454774">animal studies</GlossaryTermRef>, cartilage products have been administered in a variety
of ways.  In some studies, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044068">oral</GlossaryTermRef>
administration of either liquid or powdered forms has been
used.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="39"/><Reference refidx="40"/><Reference refidx="43"/><Reference refidx="44"/><Reference refidx="59"/> <Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="47"/>  In other studies, cartilage
products have been given by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044678">injection</GlossaryTermRef> (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046682">intravenous</GlossaryTermRef> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046339">intraperitoneal</GlossaryTermRef>), applied <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045927">topically</GlossaryTermRef>, or placed in slow-release

studies,<Reference refidx="5"/> the name of the cartilage product was not identified; however, in
the third study,<Reference refidx="6"/> the commercially available product BeneFin was used.  Ten
patients in each study completed at least 8 weeks of treatment and therefore  were considered evaluable for response.  No complete responses or
partial responses were observed in any of the studies.  Two evaluable patients
in the breast cancer study were reported to have stable disease that lasted 8
weeks or more; two evaluable patients in the brain tumor study had stable
disease that lasted 20 weeks or more; and three evaluable patients in the
