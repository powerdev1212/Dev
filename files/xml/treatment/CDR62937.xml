more recently, ureteroscopy and biopsy.

endoscopic access to the ureter and renal pelvis.  This may permit greater

</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><Para id="_46">Each of these classifications has been subclassified into categories of
unicentricity or multicentricity. The latter category indicates a more pervasive tumor
diathesis and generally a less favorable prognosis.
</Para><Para id="_47">Although the classifications listed above have prognostic significance, they
can only be determined at the time of nephroureterectomy, which is the
treatment of choice for patients with this disease.  Because of the high
incidence of tumor recurrence within the intramural ureter among patients who
have had incomplete excision of this area, nephroureterectomy should include
the entire ureter and a margin of periureteral orifice mucosa (i.e., bladder cuff).
</Para><Para id="_48">A TNM system for staging has been established and has demonstrated accurate
predictions of survival.  The TNM staging system may be a better predictor of
prognosis than tumor grade, though both are strongly predictive of survival. 
Median survival for patients with tumors confined to the subepithelial
connective tissue was 91.1 months compared to 12.9 months for patients with
tumors invading the muscularis and beyond in one  report.  Flow cytometry analysis
identifies low-stage, low-grade tumors at high risk of recurrence by virtue of
their aneuploid histograms.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/>

of asynchronous development of contralateral upper tract tumors, and the
increased risk of tumor recurrence in the ipsilateral ureter distal to the
original pelvic tumor are the rationale for total nephroureterectomy with
bladder cuff for most patients with renal pelvic transitional cell cancers and
ureteral cancers.
</Para><Para id="_51">Contemplation of anything less than total excision must take into account the
potential risk for tumor recurrence anywhere in the upper tract unit.  In other
than unifocal, low-grade, low-stage renal pelvic tumors, the probable extensive
involvement of both contiguous and noncontiguous sites would appear to make
segmental excision an unnecessary option with a potentially serious risk. 
However, an operative possibility includes segmental excision of a particular
lesion.  If the extent of a tumor can be determined by intraoperative
assessment, and frozen section histologic diagnosis confirms low-grade,
unifocal tumor of limited size, then segmental excision is possible.  However,
this approach should be reserved for highly selected patients.  This includes
those patients who have a solitary kidney or those with decreased renal
function and who require maximal preservation of renal tissue.  The likelihood
of tumor recurrence in this setting, and of extension of disease outside the
renal pelvis once the pelvis has been violated, is a serious risk that must be
heavily weighed in offering a patient this therapeutic option.
</Para><Para id="_52">Ureteral transitional cell cancer may more readily offer the possibility of
segmental excision if the absence of proximal disease can be documented.  In
this setting, attention is focused on the ease of reconstruction of the ureter
and restoration of ureterovesical continuity.  This is most feasible if the
cancer is in the distal ureter.  If partial ureterectomy is possible and
proximal disease has been excluded, then segmental excision and ureteral
reimplantation can be performed.
</Para><Para id="_53">Systematic regional lymph node dissection in conjunction with
nephroureterectomy or segmental excision has not been found to enhance the
effectiveness of surgery if tumors are of high grade or high stage, since in
these instances the overall results are so poor.  Correspondingly, lymph node
involvement is uncommon in low-stage disease, and lymphadenectomy is therefore
unlikely to remove additional tumor.  Thus, lymph node dissection at the time
of nephrectomy may offer prognostic information, but little, if any,
therapeutic benefit.

</Strong></Para><Para id="_60">The development of new instrumentation for endourological treatment of upper
tract transitional cell cancer has provided new options for regional management
of these cancers.  Introduction of electrofulguration and resection instruments
or laser probes either transureterally or percutaneously may permit destruction
of a primary cancer.  Introduction of cytotoxic agents has also been employed. 
Although a biopsy can be taken for staging purposes, the accuracy of this
remains to be determined.  The efficacy of treatment by these maneuvers has not
been established.

successes that have been reported with intravesical cytotoxic (thiotepa,
mitomycin, doxorubicin) or immunologic/inflammatory (BCG, interferon) therapy
for superficial transitional cell cancers in the bladder have led to the
occasional use of these agents in the treatment of upper tract cancers. 
Long-term follow-up of the results of such treatments has generally not been
reported, and the efficacy of this approach cannot be assessed, largely because
experience has been limited to those patients whose compromised clinical status
(solitary kidney, renal failure, medical risks for surgery) may have influenced
clinical outcome.  The use of this approach will be limited by the extent of
disease in the renal pelvis, the access that these agents may have to the area
of disease, the sensitivity of the cancer being treated, and the adequacy and
accuracy of initial tumor staging and continued monitoring.
</ListItem><ListItem>Laser vaporization/coagulation.  Transurethral and percutaneous access to
the upper tract have permitted the use of laser therapy in the control of
superficial upper tract transitional cell cancers.  This approach is dependent
on accurate staging and adequate visualization of the lesions that need to be
coagulated.  Results of this approach are at present too preliminary to assess. 
Therapeutic efficacy, however, will depend on staging accuracy on initial
treatment and ease of monitoring such patients for disease recurrence and
possible progression.

Chemotherapy regimens that have been shown effective for metastatic bladder
cancer have generally been applied to transitional cell cancers arising from
other sites.  Patients with distant metastases have a poor prognosis, and can
be appropriately offered treatment on a clinical trial.
</Para><Para id="_73">In patients with metastatic or recurrent transitional cell carcinoma of the
bladder, combination chemotherapy has produced high response rates and
occasional complete responses.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>  Results from a randomized trial that
compared methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (M-VAC) to
single-agent cisplatin in advanced bladder cancer show a significant advantage
with M-VAC in both response rate and median survival.  The overall response
rate with M-VAC in this cooperative group trial was 39%.<Reference refidx="3"/>
