adjustment issues through the adjustment disorders of the fourth revised edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental

threshold (i.e., meets some diagnostic criteria but not all) of diagnosable
mental disorders; to syndromes that meet the full diagnostic criteria for a
mental disorder (e.g., major depressive disorder).  This summary focuses
primarily on the less severe end of this continuum: the normal adjustment

Different cutoff scores have been used, with most studies using a cutoff score of 4 or 5.</Para><Para id="_622">Pooled results from multiple studies suggest that approximately 40% of cancer patients report significant distress.<Reference refidx="7"/>  Patients with lung, pancreatic, and brain cancers seem more likely to report distress, but in general, type of cancer is only modestly associated with distress.</Para><Para id="_623">In regard to prevalence of distress along the clinical course, one study of 236 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients (awaiting their initial consultation with a surgical oncologist) found that 41% reported distress scores higher than 5 on the DT. In this same group of women, 11% reported symptoms suggestive of major depression, and 10% reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_624">In a study of 321 women with newly diagnosed stage I to stage III breast cancer, the ability of the single-item DT to specifically predict depression—as measured by a self-report questionnaire of the nine symptoms for major depressive disorder in the fourth revised edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM-IV-TR)—was investigated.  Sensitivity and specificity characteristics were evaluated, and the optimal cutoff score of 7 was identified, resulting in a sensitivity of 0.81 and a specificity of 0.85 for detecting depression.  Therefore, individuals scoring 7 or above should undergo a more thorough psychosocial evaluation.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_625">Regarding predictors of distress, in a large sample (N = 380) of patients with mixed cancer diagnoses, those reporting a score of 4 or higher on the DT were more likely to be women, to have poorer functional performance (self-reported Karnofsky Performance Scale), and to have reported (on the Problem List that accompanies the DT) problems with housing, dealing with children, dealing with partner, depression, fears, nervousness, sadness, worry, and 14 of 20 physical ailments.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_626">In regard to predictors of posttreatment distress, a longitudinal, observational study of 151 women with early-stage breast cancer found that physical symptoms and side effects experienced during treatment were predictive of posttreatment cancer-related distress, amounting to 6% of the total 24% of variance accounted for.<Reference refidx="10"/>   In addition, demographic variables associated with this posttreatment cancer-related distress included younger age, nonwhite racial status, and less formal education. Clinical variables associated with distress included having a mastectomy rather than lumpectomy, receiving hormonal treatment, and the presence of a diagnosable mental disorder at the time of recruitment into the study.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="15386639">Hoffman BM, Zevon MA, D'Arrigo MC, et al.: Screening for distress in cancer patients: the NCCN rapid-screening measure.

Screening is a rapid method of identifying patients with psychosocial distress and is 
typically conducted  by non–mental-health professionals using brief self-report questionnaires to determine whether an individual needs referral
for more extensive assessment.<Reference refidx="3"/>  The psychosocial assessment of the cancer
patient is a more in-depth clinical interview focused on factors relevant to
coping and adaptation.  Mental health professionals conduct the assessment
interview to determine how well a patient is adjusting.<Reference refidx="1"/>
</Para><Para id="_570">Various comprehensive cancer centers have developed models for screening for
psychosocial distress.  Although there are notable differences, most models
involve the following sequential steps:</Para><ItemizedList id="_571" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Screening administration.</ListItem><ListItem>Scoring and evaluation.</ListItem><ListItem>Referral.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_572">Most screening for psychosocial distress focuses on the individual patient; however, some family-focused screening procedures are being developed.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_573">Administration of a screening instrument involves a 5- to 10-minute
process in which each patient answers a series of simple, straightforward
questions about distress, either orally or via a self-report paper-based questionnaire or
computer questionnaire.  Answers are scored and evaluated on the basis of previously
determined criteria.  If scores fall above the defined criteria, then a formal
referral to the appropriate discipline (social work, psychology, psychiatry,
palliative care, or pastoral care) is made.  Distress management then begins with
a more comprehensive face-to-face psychosocial assessment interview <Reference refidx="1"/> by a
qualified health care professional (e.g., social worker, psychologist,
psychiatrist, palliative care specialist, or pastoral counselor) appropriate to the issues identified.</Para><Para id="_606">The success of screening programs can be measured in terms of the following outcomes:</Para><ItemizedList id="_607" Style="bullet" Compact="No">
     <ListItem>Accurate identification of patients who are experiencing significant psychosocial distress.</ListItem><ListItem>Improved referral of patients to appropriate health care professionals to address clinically relevant distress.</ListItem><ListItem>Acceptance of such referrals by patients who are experiencing high-level distress.</ListItem><ListItem>	Improved patient-clinician communication, with frequent discussion of quality-of-life issues during patient visits.</ListItem><ListItem>Decreased level of distress and improved quality of life resulting from the screening program.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_574">Few empirical studies have evaluated the impact of structured screening programs using the outcomes above. Intervention in most of these studies included telephone follow-up of screening results with referrals or in-person discussions with clinicians, trained or untrained in screening. Study designs have differed in terms of screening tools (brief vs. comprehensive screening tools), intervention components (trained vs. untrained screening clinicians), and study outcomes. Study designs have also differed in their controls; for example, control groups in some studies did not undergo screening,<Reference refidx="5"/> while others involved patient screening but with no screening results conveyed to clinicians.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_608">The results of the screening studies have been mixed, depending on the structure of the screening programs and the assessed outcomes.

distress” at a rating of 10.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_578">Patients are asked, “How would you rate your
distress today, on a scale of 0 to 10?”  Accompanying the thermometer is a
problem list that helps identify relevant potential sources of stress.  The patient is  asked to check off the problems that are most relevant.  Categories of problems include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_579" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Practical (e.g., housing, insurance,
or transportation).</ListItem><ListItem>Physical (e.g., pain, nausea, or fatigue).</ListItem><ListItem>Family or support

depression, or anger).</ListItem><ListItem>Spiritual/religious (e.g., relating to God or loss of
faith).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_580">The primary oncology team (oncologist, nurse, palliative care
specialist, and social worker) is responsible for administering and evaluating a
patient’s response to this brief screening and arranging for a  referral, when
necessary.  Preliminary testing of this procedure used a cutoff score of 5 or
higher as requiring further evaluation.  Initial needs assessments have shown
that 20% to 35% of patients report significant levels of distress.</Para><Para id="_581">At Johns Hopkins Cancer Center, all new patients receive an 18-item version of the Brief
Symptom Inventory (BSI),<Reference refidx="10"/> which lists 18 problems people sometimes experience
(e.g., feeling faint or dizzy, having no interest in things, loneliness, or nausea or
upset stomach).  They are asked, “How much were you distressed by” each of the
18 problems “during the past 7 days including today?”  The procedure is
automated and utilizes existing clerical and support staff to distribute and
retrieve the inventory during the first or second visit.<Reference refidx="2"/>  After computerized
scoring is completed, professional staff is involved when offers for services
are being provided.  Patients screened as having high distress are referred to a
social worker for immediate follow-up; those screened as having low
distress are referred to the psychosocial orientation program, which is a structured educational program designed to enhance the adaptation of patients
by providing information about a range of psychosocial programs (e.g.,
disease-specific support groups or psychoeducational presentations).</Para><Para id="_582">The Oncology Symptom Control Research group at Community Cancer Care typically
screens all incoming patients with the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale
(ZSDS).<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/>  The ZSDS is a 20-item self-report depression screen that has been
used to detect depression and more general distress; single items are also used
to screen for conditions such as fatigue.<Reference refidx="13"/>  Staff typically administer the
screen while patients are in the waiting room.  Scores are analyzed immediately
after completion so that the medical oncologists can be briefed on any
pertinent issues.  In addition, patients scoring in the moderate range or
higher are identified for further follow-up and more extensive interviews and
assessment by the staff psychiatrist or psychologist.  Also, patients
who trigger single items of interest such as fatigue are interviewed and
monitored for possible inclusion in a number of symptom-control research trials.

The psychometric properties of the DT (a 0–10 visual analog scale, in the form of a thermometer labeled with “No Distress” at 0, “Moderate Distress” at the midpoint, and  “Extreme Distress” at 10) have been investigated.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para><Para id="_604">The measure was found to have reasonable convergent and divergent validity when compared with two well-established, multidimensional symptom inventories.  This very brief rapid-screening procedure has a moderate ability to accurately detect distress as defined by scores indicative of “caseness” on the two-symptom inventories.  When specific cutoff scores were tested to maximize sensitivity and specificity, no single cutoff that maximized accuracy of classification was discovered.  Thus, it was recommended that varying cutoff scores result in different referral recommendations, such that low scores result in no referral, moderate scores result in an optional referral, and high scores result in a strong recommendation for further interventions.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_592"><Title>Self-Report Screening Instruments</Title><Para id="_593">The NCCN single-item, rapid-screening instrument asks patients to rate their distress on a scale of 0 (“no distress”) to 10 (“extreme distress”).  On an accompanying problem list, patients are asked to indicate what has been a problem for them in the past week.  Studies <Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/> have tested the ability of the single-item measure to accurately identify patients in distress. In general, these ultrashort screening methods have demonstrated only modest overall accuracy.  They are best for ruling out, but performed poorly at confirming, distress, anxiety, and depression.</Para><Para id="_605">Many other self-report questionnaires have been used as screening instruments (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062891#_105" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/anxiety-distress-hp-pdq">Table 1</SummaryRef>); in general, they also are better for ruling out distress and perform poorly at confirming distress.  Thus, most screening instruments will yield a high number of false-positive results and need to be followed by a more extensive psychosocial assessment interview.</Para><Table id="_105"><Title>Table 1.

each patient.  Triage—the process of communicating screening results,
discussing each patient’s needs, and determining the best course of further
action—is key to the successful use of screening.  In fact, screening without
availability of appropriate treatment resources is considered unethical.  The primary oncology team (oncologist, nurse, palliative care specialist,
social worker, and counselor) is responsible for successful triage.  In some
studies a significant percentage of patients who report moderate to high levels
of distress refuse further assessment.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/>  Thus, it is important to

the distress.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_596"><Title>Psychosocial Assessment</Title><Para id="_597">The assessment of psychosocial adaptation should follow screening when distress is identified.  The psychosocial assessment is typically a semistructured interview during which the professional evaluates how well an individual patient, a patient’s family, and other significant people in a patient’s life are adapting to the current demands of the illness. In general, this assessment process considers a wide variety of factors relevant to overall adaptation.<Reference refidx="1"/> (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062891#_15" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/anxiety-distress-hp-pdq">General Factors Influencing Adjustment</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information.)</Para><Para id="_598">A successful transition from screening to assessment involves clear communication between the oncology team and the patient. 
Although there is no single best way to talk to patients about psychosocial
needs, clinical experience suggests some important concepts.  First, most

ongoing process in which the individual patient tries to manage emotional
distress, solve specific cancer-related problems, and gain mastery or control
over cancer-related life events.  Adjustment to cancer is not a unitary, single
event but rather a series of ongoing coping responses to the multiple tasks associated with living with cancer.  Patients are faced with many challenges that vary
with the clinical course of the disease.  Common periods of crisis and
significant challenge include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_384" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Diagnosis.</ListItem><ListItem>Treatment (surgery, radiation,
and chemotherapy).</ListItem><ListItem>Posttreatment and remission.</ListItem><ListItem>Recurrence and palliative care.<Reference refidx="6"/></ListItem><ListItem>Survivorship.<Reference refidx="3"/></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_385">  
Each of these events has certain coping tasks, particular
existential questions, many common emotional responses, and specific problems.</Para><Para id="_8">Normal or successful adjustment is indicated in patients who are able to
minimize disruptions to life roles, regulate emotional distress, and remain
actively involved in aspects of life that continue to hold meaning and
importance.<Reference refidx="5"/>
</Para><Para id="_9">Coping refers to the specific thoughts and behaviors a person uses in his or
her efforts to adjust.<Reference refidx="2"/>  Coping style refers to the most common, more
frequent, and longer-term style of coping that an individual tends to use
across a variety of life situations.  One’s coping style is often closely
related to one’s overall disposition and personality (e.g., optimism,
pessimism, introversion, extroversion).<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_10">Coping strategies refer to those less frequently used and more
situation-specific coping efforts, such as readjusting one’s daily routine or
work schedule to adjust to the side effects of cancer treatment.
Coping strategies comprise efforts to adjust.  Although there are many
successful coping strategies, three broad categories have been noted:<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/></Para><OrderedList id="_108" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>Problem focused.</ListItem><ListItem>Emotion focused.</ListItem><ListItem>Meaning focused.</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_109">Problem-focused
strategies help patients manage specific problems by directly trying to alter
problem situations.  Emotion-focused strategies help a person regulate his or
her degree of emotional distress. Meaning-focused strategies help patients
understand why this has happened and what impact cancer will have on their
life.  In general, persons who adjust well typically remain committed and
actively engaged in the process of coping with cancer and continue to find
meaning and importance in their lives.  Conversely, persons who do not adjust
well often become disengaged, withdraw, and feel hopeless.  Thus, assessing the
degree of engagement versus giving up may be a way to distinguish between
successful and unsuccessful adjustment.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_392">For example, in a correlational study of adolescent cancer patients and their parents, engagement coping by the adolescent (including cognitive restructuring, seeking social support, expressing emotions, and problem solving) was associated with lower levels of distress. Conversely,  disengagement coping by parents (including problem avoidance, wishful thinking, social withdrawal, and self-criticism) was associated with increased distress.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_393">In a prospective investigation of different types of problem-focused coping strategies, 146 women with early-stage breast cancer were studied.  Study results showed that a  strategy of concentrating on symptoms, measured at the end of treatment, was predictive of less improvement in physical and mental quality of life at 6 months' follow-up, while a   strategy of information seeking was associated with greater improvement in physical quality of life.  These findings suggest that problem-focused coping consists of a variety of specific coping strategies—only some of which may be beneficial to quality of life.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_200">One criticism of the literature on coping with cancer focuses on the assumption that “coping with cancer” is a single unitary event.  In reality, coping with cancer involves coping styles and strategies that may differ and vary according to the nature of the stressors being encountered.  For example, in a study of 52 adults receiving palliative care for cancer,<Reference refidx="13"/> patients participated in a semistructured interview during which they were asked how they coped with their most significant stressors.  Three stressor domains were identified:</Para><ItemizedList id="_394" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Social</ListItem><ListItem>Physical</ListItem><ListItem>Existential</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_395"> Three categories of coping were also identified:</Para><ItemizedList id="_396" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Problem focused</ListItem><ListItem>Emotion focused</ListItem><ListItem>Emotion-focused avoidance</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_397">Results showed that most participants used a range of coping strategies; however, there were interactions between stressor domains and coping categories.  Problem-focused strategies were used less frequently for the existential stressors, while emotion-focused strategies were used less frequently for the physical stressors.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para><SummarySection id="_11"><Title>Coping Theory</Title><Para id="_12">One cognitive theory of coping <Reference refidx="14"/> proposes that in response to significant
life events, a person asks two important questions:</Para><ItemizedList id="_398" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Is this event personally
significant to me?</ListItem><ListItem>What resources do I have to manage/control this
event?</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_399">When an event is perceived to be of personal significance (nearly all
cancer-related life events would be), and when one’s personal resources
are perceived to be inadequate to the demands of managing the event, distress
can occur.  One way to conceptualize the amount of distress experienced by
patients is the balance or ratio between perception of the demands that a
situation (e.g., chemotherapy) places upon them and perception of the resources
they possess (e.g., effective antiemetics) to effectively manage these
demands:</Para><Para id="_13">Distress = Perceived Demands/Perceived Resources
</Para><Para id="_14">Individuals with the same diagnosis or treatment regimen may experience very
different levels of distress.  A high level of distress could result from an
individual’s perceptions that either the demands of a situation are very high
or his or her resources are very low (or both).  Conversely, low distress is
the result of a perception that either the demands of a situation are very low
or the individual’s resources are high.<Reference refidx="15"/>  To lower distress, therefore,
either the perceived demands of the situation should be lowered, or the
perceived resources should be increased.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_15"><Title>General Factors Influencing Adjustment</Title><Para id="_16">Although there are some commonalities in normal adjustment to the varying
stressors of cancer, there are also many individual differences.  It is
difficult to predict how individuals will cope with cancer, so it is important
to recognize factors that influence adjustment to cancer. One study of  women with stage II or III breast cancer <Reference refidx="16"/> reported that higher levels of stress measured postsurgically at the time of diagnosis predicted lower physical and psychological quality of life.  The stress measures included the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_400" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Number of stressful life events in the past year.</ListItem><ListItem>Cancer-related traumatic stress symptoms.</ListItem><ListItem>Perceived global stress.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_401">All measures were predictive.<Reference refidx="16"/></Para><Para id="_402">Another study evaluated women with stage 0 breast cancer to stage  III breast cancer (N = 89) at three time points: during treatment, at 3 weeks following end of treatment, and at 3 months posttreatment. Most survivors showed good adjustment on general distress indices. The factors predicting sustained distress included young age, history of depression or anxiety, and more extensive treatment. Younger age was the only factor that predicted greater distress across all evaluated measures.<Reference refidx="17"/> </Para><Para id="_403">Psychosocial
adjustment/adaptation has been determined to be influenced by three broad
categories of factors: cancer derived, patient derived, and
society derived.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="18"/>  Cancer-derived factors include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_404" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Type of cancer.</ListItem><ListItem>Cancer stage.</ListItem><ListItem>Prognosis.</ListItem><ListItem>Where a patient falls in the cancer
continuum of diagnosis, treatment, and recurrence.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_405">Patient-derived factors
include two types of resources:<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_406" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Intrapersonal coping resources.</ListItem><ListItem>Interpersonal social support (e.g., family support).<Reference refidx="21"/></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_407">Patient-derived factors also include consideration for stage of life <Reference refidx="22"/> (i.e.,
developmental tasks—young adults may respond quite differently compared with older
adults).</Para><Para id="_408">Society-derived factors include the general societal views of cancer
(e.g., stigma), as well as the influence society has on issues such as
availability of treatments, open versus closed discussion of the illness, and
popular beliefs about cause. </Para><Para id="_409">The personality traits of optimism and pessimism might play a critical role in the psychological well-being of cancer patients.  A German study investigated the impact of optimism and pessimism on psychological well-being in 161 newly diagnosed cancer patients with heterogeneous cancers.<Reference refidx="23"/>  Patients were assessed for optimism/pessimism and  positive/negative emotions before the start of their first chemotherapy session and at 9 months' follow-up.  Before the start of chemotherapy, psychological well-being was associated with higher optimism and lower pessimism.  Only pessimism predicted negative change in psychological well-being at the 9-month follow-up. Additionally, only pessimism predicted heightened perception of chemotherapy-related side effects.</Para><Para id="_209">The availability of social support, as part of a social network, has been found to be related to mortality from breast cancer.  In a longitudinal study of 2,835 female nurses with breast cancer, those who, before diagnosis, reported no close contacts (e.g., relatives, friends, or living children) had a twofold increased risk of mortality from breast cancer, compared with those who had more social contacts (e.g., ten or more close relatives).  This increased mortality was only found when comparing these two extremes in social ties, suggesting that women with relatively few social  contacts or an intermediate number of contacts may not be at increased risk.  Overall, these results suggest the important role of close relatives willing to step in and provide needed care.<Reference refidx="19"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_17"><Title>Situation-Specific Influences on Adjustment</Title><SummarySection id="_86"><Title>Hearing the diagnosis</Title><Para id="_19">The process of adjusting to cancer can begin even before a diagnosis.  Patients
may respond with normal levels of fear, worry, and concern when they have
unexplained symptoms or when they realize that they are undergoing testing to
determine the presence of cancer.  When they hear the diagnosis, their fears
become realized, generating a psychological and existential plight
(crisis).<Reference refidx="24"/>  Many people wonder, “Could I die from this?” 
</Para><Para id="_20">Receiving a diagnosis of cancer results in a crisis that includes expected and
normal emotional distress.  One author <Reference refidx="25"/> has described the normal responses
to the crisis of cancer as consisting of three phases: </Para><OrderedList id="_110" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>Initial response.</ListItem><ListItem>Dysphoria.</ListItem><ListItem>Adaptation. 
</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_21">Phase I, the <Strong>initial response</Strong>, consists of disbelief, denial, and shock that
the news is true.  Some patients will attempt to prove that the diagnosis is
not true (“Are you sure you have the right test results?”).  Most patients will
report a period of disbelief accompanied by an inability to clearly process
information.  They may feel numb or in shock, or as if, “This can’t be happening
to me.”  
</Para><Para id="_421">Such a high level of distress can be problematic because many times,
immediately after informing patients of their diagnosis, physicians outline the
treatment options.  Under these emotional circumstances, many patients may be
unable to understand or remember this important information.  Thus, the
presence of others or other means of being able to review the information can
be extremely important (e.g., tape recording the discussion about the treatment
plan or providing a second appointment at a later date, specifically for
reviewing the treatment plan).  Although there are many individual differences,
this initial response of disbelief, denial, and shock usually lasts about a
week in patients who adjust well.  
</Para><Para id="_22">Phase II, <Strong>dysphoria</Strong>, consists of a variable period of time (but usually lasting
1–2 weeks) during which the patient is slowly acknowledging the reality of the
diagnosis.  During this time patients will typically begin to experience a
significant degree of distress in the form of depression, anxiety, insomnia,
anorexia, poor concentration, and varying degrees of inability to function in
daily roles.  Intrusive thoughts of illness and death may occur very often and
seem to be uncontrollable.</Para><Para id="_422">As more information about treatment options is
provided, correctly processed, and understood, feelings of hope and optimism
begin to emerge more frequently through the dysphoria.  Distress levels can be elevated for newly diagnosed patients awaiting surgery.  Additional professional support to address problems such as fatigue, insomnia, and depressed mood can be helpful during this time.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para><Para id="_23">Phase III, <Strong>longer-term adaptation</Strong>, consists of the extended time during which
more long-lasting and permanent adjustment occurs.  This period consists of
weeks and months.  During this period, patients are utilizing a variety of
coping strategies and styles.<Reference refidx="9"/>  Coping styles are longer-term, established
ways for coping with many previous life events; coping strategies are
situation-specific efforts to resolve particular cancer-related situations. 
This combination of longer-term coping styles and short-term coping strategies
usually serves patients well in their efforts at adaptation.  There is no single best way to cope.  The individual differences
patients bring to their encounters with cancer will result in varied coping
styles and strategies.<Reference refidx="5"/>
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_87"><Title>Active cancer treatments</Title><Para id="_25">During the active treatment phase of the illness, a patient’s adjustment is
focused primarily on coping with the many and varied stressors of treatment. 
These may include apprehension and fears about:</Para><ItemizedList id="_410" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Painful procedures.</ListItem><ListItem> Unwanted
side effects (hair loss, nausea/vomiting, fatigue, and pain).</ListItem><ListItem>Disruptions to
daily life (including changes in life roles—for example, the breadwinner who can no longer work).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_411">Patients who
adjust well are able to tolerate these short-term stressors via a cost-benefit
approach in which they weigh the discomforts of short-term loss against the
benefits of long-term gains (e.g., increased survival) and conclude, “It is
worth it.”<Reference refidx="25"/>  Questions that often occur during active treatment include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_412" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Will I survive this?</ListItem><ListItem>Will they get all of the cancer?</ListItem><ListItem>What side effects will I
experience?</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_413"> As these and related questions arise, patients utilize coping
styles and strategies to adapt.  Although many different coping strategies are
useful during this phase, problem-focused coping—strategies designed to manage
specific problem situations (e.g., fatigue, transportation to treatments,
altered work schedules, and role changes)—are often utilized.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_88"><Title>Posttreatment </Title><Para id="_27">Before active treatments are completed, most patients look forward to the
conclusion of treatment with positive anticipation and hopes of returning to
normal.  However, the completion of active treatment can be a time of great
ambivalence for cancer patients and their families.  The completion of
treatments suggests a time of celebration and relief, yet it can also be a time
of heightened distress, with a renewed sense of vulnerability that comes with
the cessation of active medical efforts to fight the disease.<Reference refidx="27"/></Para><Para id="_414">Those who
adjust well are able to balance their positive expectations with the realities
of ongoing fears and apprehensions.  Many patients report enhanced anxiety and
worry related to fears of recurrence and decreasing frequency of medical
surveillance via less frequent physician contacts.  Other adjustment issues
include living with uncertainty, returning to previous life roles, and
hypervigilance to health concerns.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_415">During remission, patients begin a
sequence of regular follow-up appointments with their oncologist.  Normal
anxiety and worry often intensify as the dates of follow-up appointments
approach.  Normal anxiety comes from concerns about recurrence and the related
emotional consequences (e.g., re-entry into the patient role and renewed
feelings of loss of control).<Reference refidx="28"/>  Many patients find waiting for test results
to be a particularly distressing experience.</Para><Para id="_190"> In one of the few empirical studies of posttreatment adjustment, 94 women with stage 0, I, II, or III breast cancer who were completing radiation therapy were assessed on measures of depression, anxiety, and quality of life on the last day of treatment and at 2 weeks, 4 to 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months posttreatment.  Results found elevated symptoms of depression, low-level anxiety, and diminished quality of life on the last day of treatment; however, by 2 weeks later, symptoms of depression decreased significantly, and quality of life improved significantly.  No other significant changes were found at any of the later posttreatment time periods, suggesting improvements in depression and quality of life occur quickly in most patients.<Reference refidx="29"/></Para><Para id="_28">Normal adjustment to posttreatment and remission involves utilization of a
variety of coping strategies; however, this phase often involves the frequent
use of emotion-focused coping strategies (those designed to help regulate the
normal emotional distress), given the variety of ambivalent emotional
reactions.  Those who adjust well are more likely to be comfortable expressing
a wide range of both positive and negative emotions.  Emotion-focused coping
strategies include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_416" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Honesty with one’s emotions.</ListItem><ListItem>Awareness of one’s
feelings.</ListItem><ListItem>Nonjudgmental acceptance of one’s feelings.</ListItem><ListItem>Ability to
articulate these feelings to others.</ListItem><ListItem>Willingness to approach the task of
working through these emotions.</ListItem><ListItem>Availability of support from others willing
to listen and accept.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_89"><Title>Recurrence
</Title><Para id="_30">The transition from a curative treatment plan to one of palliative care is
extremely difficult for cancer patients.<Reference refidx="25"/>  Extreme anguish often accompanies
this transition as the patient faces renewed psychological distress, physical
symptoms, and the existential crisis of death, all of which combine to result
in the suffering often associated with advanced cancer.<Reference refidx="30"/>
</Para><Para id="_31">The normal adjustment to this crisis is characterized by initial shock,
disbelief, and denial followed by a period of significant distress (e.g.,
depressed mood, difficulty concentrating, frequent intrusive thoughts of
death).  Normal adjustment may include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_417" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Periods of significant sadness and
crying.</ListItem><ListItem>Periodic feelings of anger at God or one’s perceived higher power.</ListItem><ListItem>Periods of withdrawal and isolation.</ListItem><ListItem>Thoughts of giving up.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_418"> However,
as with the initial diagnosis, this distress is often followed by a gradual
adjustment over a period of weeks.  It is important to note that these common
reactions do not necessarily indicate psychopathology.  Although the intensity
of these emotions might be similar to more severe psychopathology, their
frequency of occurrence and duration tend to be shorter.  Patients experiencing
normal adjustment to recurrence and palliative care will typically rally from
these strong emotions more quickly than those experiencing a true mental
disorder.  (Refer to the PDQ summaries on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062739" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/depression-hp-pdq">Depression</SummaryRef> and

</Para><Para id="_32">Adjustment to recurrence and palliative care often involves shifting
expectations from cure to healing.  From this perspective, healing involves a
process of becoming whole again,<Reference refidx="31"/> of transforming one’s life in a variety
of ways in the face of death.  This process of adjustment involves maintaining
hope, which is viewed as crucial in overall adaptation to crisis.<Reference refidx="32"/></Para><Para id="_419">The
patient who successfully adjusts to the crisis of recurrence often shifts
expectations and maintains hope in a variety of meaningful life activities. 
For example, a patient who has confidence that pain and suffering can be
controlled will have hope for future quality of life.  Patients who
believe they are loved and cared for will have hope in their future
relationships.  Religion and spirituality play a very important role in helping
many patients maintain hope.  Religion or spirituality can provide a belief
structure that helps in coping with the crises of recurrence.  During
recurrence and palliative care, patients are likely to utilize meaning-based
coping strategies and are likely to seek comfort in prayer and in their
religious practices/rituals or spiritual beliefs. In addition, one study  suggests that prognostic awareness in combination with   inner peace is associated with better mental health and quality of death outcomes for patients with advanced cancer and for their surviving caregivers during bereavement.<Reference refidx="33"/></Para><Para id="_114">In a study of women with recurrent breast cancer, significant impairments  in physical, functional, and emotional well-being were found within 1 month after recurrence;  however, a patient’s self-efficacy (confidence in his or her ability to manage the demands of  illness), social support, and family hardiness (family’s  internal strength and ability to manage hardship and change) had positive effects on quality of life.  Conversely, more distress about physical symptoms, additional life concerns, a sense of hopelessness, and a negative perception of  illness or  caregiving were associated with a lower quality of life.<Reference refidx="34"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_90"><Title>Survivorship</Title><Para id="_34">The adjustment from posttreatment  to long-term survivorship is
gradual and extends over many years.  However, most patients, despite various
cancer diagnoses and treatments, adjust well,<Reference refidx="3"/> with some even reporting
benefits to a cancer diagnosis (e.g., greater appreciation of life,
reprioritizing of life values, strengthening of spiritual or religious
beliefs).<Reference refidx="35"/><Reference refidx="36"/><Reference refidx="37"/><Reference refidx="38"/>  Patients who have poorer adjustment tend to have greater
medical problems, fewer social supports, poorer premorbid psychological
adjustment, and fewer economic resources.<Reference refidx="3"/>
</Para><Para id="_35">As cancer treatments have improved, cancer is becoming a chronic illness,
particularly with certain cancer types (e.g., prostate, breast).  Each of the
various psychosocial areas of functioning with a chronic illness has its own
unique adjustment issues.  For example, long-term adjustment to being a
survivor of cancer involves considerations of how one adjusts psychologically,
socially, sexually, vocationally, and, of course, physically.
</Para><Para id="_36">In general, studies of cancer survivors and healthy comparison groups have
found no significant differences in measures of psychological distress, marital
and sexual adjustment, social functioning, and overall psychosocial
functioning.<Reference refidx="3"/>  However, there are some common areas of distress experienced
by many cancer patients that are subthreshold or not severe enough to meet
diagnostic criteria.  These may include the following:<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="39"/>
</Para><ItemizedList id="_420" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Anxiety about recurrence.</ListItem><ListItem>Increased
sense of vulnerability.</ListItem><ListItem>Lowered sense of control.</ListItem><ListItem>Conditioned reminders of
chemotherapy (smells, sights) that produce anxiety and nausea.</ListItem><ListItem>Post-traumatic
stress–like symptoms (such as persistent, intrusive thoughts; recurrent imagery
associated with cancer treatments and feelings of estrangement from others).</ListItem><ListItem>Concerns about body image and sexuality.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_178">In one of the few prospective longitudinal studies of cancer survivors, 752 patients from three U.S. states were asked about a variety of psychosocial problems.  About 1 year after diagnosis, 68% were concerned with their illness returning, approximately 60% were worried about recurrence, and 58% had fears of the future.  In addition, approximately two out of three survivors were concerned about a physical health problem such as fatigue and loss of strength.  Approximately 48% reported concerns with sleep difficulties, and 48% reported concerns with sexual dysfunction.  Younger survivors (aged 18–54 years), women, nonwhites, unmarried survivors, and those with lower incomes reported more problems.  In comparisons of four common cancers, the most concerns regarding problems in living were reported by those with lung cancer, followed by survivors of breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers.<Reference refidx="40"/></Para><Para id="_210">A large (N = 660) longitudinal study of women breast cancer survivors older than 65 years investigated factors associated with changes in emotional well-being.  The overall findings suggest that the 5-year survivorship experience for most women is relatively stable, with few changes in emotional well-being.  However, it was noted that women who had fewer than 12 years of formal education and women who perceived themselves as  “never being cured” were more likely to experience declines in emotional well-being, while those who had better physical functioning, good emotional support, and the perception of positive physician-patient communication were less likely to have poor emotional health.<Reference refidx="41"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="11180573" MedlineID="21110805">Brennan J: Adjustment to cancer - coping or personal transition?

The original study <Reference refidx="20"/> tested a supportive-expressive group therapy format for women with metastatic breast cancer, while another study <Reference refidx="21"/> tested a psychoeducational group intervention for patients with malignant melanoma.  In both of these studies, a survival advantage was found in the intervention group. However, a critique of the first study <Reference refidx="22"/> found that members of the control group had significantly shorter survival times than would have been expected, when compared with data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, suggesting that the survival advantages may have resulted from inadvertent sampling errors.</Para><Para id="_516">Attempts to replicate the supportive-expressive group therapy findings were made in Canada,<Reference refidx="23"/> the United States,<Reference refidx="24"/> and Australia.<Reference refidx="25"/> Although all three studies found significant psychological benefits, no study could replicate the survival benefit.</Para><Para id="_517">Literature reviews, including three meta-analyses <Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/> and one systematic review,<Reference refidx="29"/> have concluded that previous research has failed to find an effect of psychotherapy on survival. One summary <Reference refidx="30"/> reported on ten additional randomized controlled trials of various psychosocial interventions for patients with various types of cancers (although most were women with breast cancer). All ten studies noted improved psychosocial benefits. However, nine of the ten showed no significant differences in survival, while one  <Reference refidx="31"/> found a survival advantage of about 1 year. This one positive trial was able to stratify groups on a number of important variables (e.g., nodal status, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status, and menopausal status) and provided data in support of possible mechanisms such as enhanced immune functioning and patient compliance with stress reduction procedures. In an analysis of results, this study identified the complexity of factors involved in any survival benefit and the possibility that immune system-mediated benefits may contribute to increased survival, when other factors are carefully taken into account.</Para><Para id="_514">In summary, the preponderance of evidence indicates that despite evidence of improved quality of life,  it seems unlikely that a psychosocial intervention has much chance of showing an independent contribution to survival time.

although prevalence rates vary by population studied.  In studies of community
samples of children, adolescents, and the elderly, prevalence estimates have
ranged from 2% to 8%.  In outpatient mental health settings, prevalence rates
have been as high as 10% to 30%; while in general hospital inpatients,
prevalence rates have been as high as 12% of those referred for a mental health
consultation.<Reference refidx="1"/>
</Para><Para id="_68">Nearly every cancer patient experiences what could be considered an
identifiable stressor, whether that is diagnosis, treatment, recurrence, or
side effects.  The presence of an adjustment disorder is determined more by the
patient’s response to the identifiable stressor, and whether that response is
considered in excess of what would be expected or results in significant
impairment, typically in social or occupational functioning.  
</Para><Para id="_69">One study <Reference refidx="2"/> evaluated 215 randomly selected hospitalized and ambulatory
cancer patients in three different cancer centers and found that of this group,
slightly fewer than half (47% or 101 patients) met the diagnostic criteria for
any mental disorder (DSM-III criteria). From this group of 101, 68% (69
patients) met the diagnostic criteria for an adjustment disorder.  Of the
entire 215 patients evaluated, approximately 32% were identified as meeting the
diagnostic criteria for an adjustment disorder—the highest prevalence of any
diagnostic category.</Para><Para id="_495">Additional reviews <Reference refidx="3"/>  have continued to find adjustment disorders to be the most common mental disorder.  In patients with advanced cancer, prevalence ranges from 14% to 34.7%; in  terminally ill patients,  rates range from 10.6% to 16.3%.  These variable prevalence rates are influenced by stage of disease, type of cancer, diagnostic procedures used, and other patient variables.   In a study of women with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy,   a 36.1%  prevalence rate was found.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_496">     In another study of terminally ill Japanese cancer patients referred to a palliative care unit, 16.3% were diagnosed with an adjustment disorder at the time of their initial referral, and 10.6% were diagnosed with an adjustment disorder at the time of their admission to the palliative care unit.

lack of specificity applies to both the identifiable stressor and the marked
distress/significant impairment.
</Para><Para id="_76">No criteria or guidelines exist in DSM-IV-TR to quantify the nature of the
psychosocial stressor(s).  Given individual differences in coping abilities,
certain stressors are likely to be very stressful for one patient and not
stressful at all for another patient.  With no quantifiable guidelines for
measuring stressors, a diagnosis is often determined by the nature of an
individual’s response.  If a person responds with marked distress or
significant impairment in functioning, it is often assumed that the life event
was an identifiable stressor.  However, the identification of a response that
evidences marked distress or significant impairment also lacks specificity and
is thus very subjective.  Many of these diagnostic terms are too vague to be
valid or reliable; thus, there is considerable variation in the use of the
adjustment disorder category.
</Para><Para id="_77">Despite these problems, the adjustment disorder category does provide a means
of identifying an emotional or behavioral response in need of further
treatment.  Cancer patients are regularly confronted with a variety of
stressors and thus face the potential of experiencing an adjustment disorder.

medication for a brief period of time (e.g., 2–3 weeks for antianxiety
medications, 12 months for antidepressants) may facilitate the psychotherapy,
allowing the patient to better employ available coping strategies.  The
specific pattern of emotional or behavioral symptoms will determine which type
of psychotropic medication to consider.  (Refer to the PDQ summary on

adaptation to cancer.  In most cases, the reactions are time limited and may
motivate patients and families to take steps to reduce anxiety (e.g., gain
information), which may assist in adjusting to the illness.  However, as discussed above, anxiety
reactions that are more prolonged or intense are classified as adjustment
disorders.  These disorders can negatively affect quality of life and interfere
with a cancer patient’s ability to function socially and emotionally.  These
anxiety reactions require intervention.<Reference refidx="4"/> Anxiety disorders may also be secondary to other aspects of the medical condition, such as uncontrolled pain, certain metabolic states, or medication side effects.</Para><Para id="_255">Other specific anxiety disorders—such as generalized anxiety, phobia, or panic disorder—are not as common among
cancer patients and usually predate the cancer diagnosis, but deserve further attention to facilitate cancer care.  The stress caused by

conditions and interventions are associated with symptoms that present as   anxiety disorders, including central
nervous system metastases, dyspnea associated with lung cancer, and treatment with corticosteroids and
other medications. A patient’s experience with cancer or other illnesses may
reactivate associations and memories of previous illness and contribute to
acute anxiety.  Certain demographic factors, such as being female and
developing cancer at a young age, are associated with increased anxiety in
medical situations.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="8"/>  Patients who have problems communicating with their

corticosteroids can produce motor restlessness, agitation, and mania as well as
depression and thoughts of suicide.  Bronchodilators and B-adrenergic receptor
stimulants used for chronic respiratory conditions can cause anxiety,
irritability, and tremulousness.  Akathisia, motor restlessness accompanied by
subjective feelings of distress, is a side effect of neuroleptic drugs, which
are commonly used for control of emesis.  Withdrawal from opioids,
benzodiazepines, barbiturates, nicotine, and alcohol can result in anxiety,
agitation, and behaviors that may be problematic for the patient who is in
active treatment.</Para><Para id="_266">Certain tumor sites can produce symptoms that resemble anxiety disorders.

Attacks or discrete periods of intense discomfort generally last for
several minutes or longer, but the discomfort generally lasts for hours.  A common complication is agoraphobia or avoidance of open places, caused by fear of situations that might trigger attacks. Patients with panic attacks often present with
symptoms that can be difficult to differentiate from other medical disorders,

To qualify as OCD, the obsessive thoughts and
compulsive behaviors must be time-consuming and sufficiently distracting to
interfere with the person’s ability to function in employment, academic, or
social situations.</Para><Para id="_472">Patients with cancer who have a history of OCD may engage in compulsive behaviors such as hand washing,
checking, or counting to such an extent that they cannot comply with treatment. 
For such patients, normal worry about the cancer diagnosis and prognosis can
develop into full obsessive-compulsive symptoms and be severely disabling.
OCD is most often managed with serotonergic
antidepressant medications (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  [SSRIs] and
clomipramine) and CBT.  Milder obsessive thoughts or use of rituals that are not interfering might be addressed with CBT, but medications are not indicated. This disorder is rare in

are caused by stressors related to cancer treatment.  Such symptoms of distress often are
resolved with psychologic support alone.  However, in some cases, pharmacologic interventions are required to address these symptoms. (Refer to <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062891#_475" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/anxiety-distress-hp-pdq">Table 3</SummaryRef> for descriptions of symptoms of anxiety disorders possibly requiring pharmacological treatment.)</Para><Para id="_520">Following are brief descriptions of pharmacological treatment options and potential indications for their use. These descriptions are based on evidence derived from studies conducted in patients without cancer   because of the lack of such studies in patients with cancer. However, it is important to note that clinicians have used some of these medications for several decades to treat anxiety symptoms in patients with cancer. The treatment options and their use in the situations described below are also based on clinical experience with these agents in patients with cancer.</Para><Para id="_521">The use of medications to treat anxiety disorders is considered when patients are experiencing more severe symptoms or when their responses to psychosocial interventions are inadequate. When counseling resources are not available or are declined by the patient, medication may be considered sooner rather than later. In certain cases, medications are started simultaneously with psychosocial interventions when it is likely that psychosocial support alone will be inadequate to provide relief or to provide it soon enough.</Para><Para id="_522">Pharmacological interventions can be used short-term or  long-term, depending on individual patient and illness factors, including the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_530" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Severity of anxiety symptoms.</ListItem><ListItem>Level of functional/social impairment.</ListItem><ListItem>Psychiatric history.</ListItem><ListItem>Continued presence of cancer.</ListItem><ListItem>Cancer treatment–related factors contributing to anxiety directly or indirectly (e.g., high-intensity or long-term cancer treatments or treatment with agents known to cause to psychiatric symptoms [e.g., cytokines]).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_523">Specific anxiety medications—i.e., medications from the benzodiazepine class, as listed in <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062891#_481" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/anxiety-distress-hp-pdq">Table 4</SummaryRef>—are frequently used alone or in combination with psychological approaches to provide relief from anxiety symptoms. These medications are effective in the acute treatment of anxiety disorders because of their rapid onset of action. They are frequently used as monotherapy or as adjunctive agents in the short-term management (&lt;4 months) of anxiety disorders.  Their long-term use (&gt;4 months) is limited by the potential for abuse and dependence and by their lack of antidepressant effects, as depression is often comorbid with anxiety disorders. Following are some of the indications and safety considerations for the use of benzodiazepines in patients with cancer:<Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_534" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Short-acting benzodiazepines such as alprazolam and lorazepam can be effectively used to provide short-term relief at specific points in the cancer continuum of diagnosis, treatment, and recurrence. Examples of such short-term use include the treatment of anxiety during diagnostic procedures (e.g., certain radioimaging procedures) and the treatment of patient anxiety about pending test results (e.g., for yearly mammograms in  patients with histories of breast cancer).</ListItem><ListItem>Cancer treatments such as intensive chemotherapeutic regimens can cause significant physical and emotional distress and thus exacerbate anxiety. Short-acting or intermediate-acting agents (e.g.,clonazepam) can provide significant relief of anxiety and other symptoms (e.g., insomnia secondary to anxiety) during active cancer treatments.</ListItem><ListItem>Longer-acting medications (e.g., diazepam and  clorazepate) should generally be avoided because of their long half-lives. These medications can cause or exacerbate cognitive impairment, disorientation, and drowsiness because of their potential for accumulation.</ListItem><ListItem>Patients with medical conditions such as delirium can present with anxiety and agitation. Benzodiazepine use in patients with such conditions is counterindicated because these agents can cause or exacerbate confusion and disorientation.</ListItem><ListItem>All patients, especially elderly patients, receiving benzodiazepines should be closely monitored for cognitive impairment, daytime sedation, and fall risks. Use of these agents should be optimized in elderly patients, patients with multiple comorbidities, patients with liver disease, and patients receiving multiple medications.</ListItem><ListItem>	Use of these agents should be closely monitored and optimized in patients receiving other sedating medications, central nervous system  depressants, and agents with potential for causing respiratory depression (e.g., opiates).</ListItem><ListItem>	It is important to continuously monitor and reevaluate anxiety symptoms in all patients receiving benzodiazepines. Use of these medications can be tapered off if anxiety symptoms resolve with the conclusion of cancer treatments.</ListItem><ListItem>	In some patients, the use of benzodiazepines is continued (as monotherapy or as adjunctive treatment) over a longer period (&gt;4 months) because of persistent and debilitating anxiety symptoms. It is important to monitor the development of tolerance, abuse, and dependence issues as well as comorbid depressive symptoms in such patients. Long-term and sometimes chronic use of these agents might be indicated in a subpopulation of patients, with close monitoring and frequent risk-benefit assessments. Persistent (after 3 or 4 months) anxiety symptoms frequently lead to depression. Patients with persistent anxiety symptoms with or without depression might benefit from alternative treatments (e.g., paroxetine, sertraline).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Table id="_481"><Title>Table 4.

needed.</ListItem><ListItem>Route of administration available.</ListItem><ListItem>Presence or absence of
active metabolites.</ListItem><ListItem>Metabolic problems.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_483">Dosing schedules depend on patient
tolerance and require individual titration.  The shorter-acting benzodiazepines
(alprazolam and lorazepam) are given 3 to 4 times per day.  Short-acting
benzodiazepines, particularly those that can be administered by multiple routes
(lorazepam and diazepam), are effective for high levels of distress. 
Benzodiazepines decrease daytime anxiety and reduce insomnia.  (Refer to the
PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062746" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/sleep-disorders-hp-pdq">Sleep Disorders</SummaryRef> for more information.)  The most common side
effects of benzodiazepines are dose dependent and are controlled by titrating
the dose to avoid drowsiness, confusion, motor incoordination, and sedation.</Para><Para id="_524"><Strong>All benzodiazepines can cause some degree of respiratory depression, which is generally minimal in patients who have not used benzodiazepines in the past. Benzodiazepines should be used cautiously (or not at all) in cases of respiratory impairment.</Strong></Para><Para id="_525">Standard precautions should be considered when any sedative drug is used in patients who have borderline respiratory function. Ongoing assessment of this population is important. Low doses of the antihistamine hydroxyzine (25 mg, 2–3 times a day) can be used safely in such situations. In patients with hepatic dysfunction, it is best to use short-acting benzodiazepines that are metabolized primarily by conjugation and excreted by the kidneys (e.g., oxazepam, temazepam, or lorazepam). Another advantage of using lorazepam is its lack of active metabolites. Conversely, other benzodiazepines should be selected in cases of renal dysfunction.</Para><Para id="_506">SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine and sertraline) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (e.g., venlafaxine) are considered first-line pharmacotherapy for long-term management of anxiety disorders. SSRIs and SNRIs are also effective in the treatment of depressive symptoms frequently comorbid with persistent anxiety disorders. SSRIs and SNRIs can take approximately 4 to 6 weeks to take effect because of their slow onset of action. Benzodiazepines are frequently used as adjunctive agents to stabilize symptoms in the initial period of treatment with SSRIs and SNRIs.</Para><Para id="_508">Atypical antidepressants (e.g., mirtazapine) are sometimes used to treat anxiety disorders because of their added effects on comorbid symptoms such as insomnia. Older medications such as tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., imipramine and clomipramine) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., phenelzine) are also effective in treating anxiety disorders. The use of antidepressants in clinical practice is limited by  their unfavorable side effects, poorer tolerability, and higher risks of toxicity.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para><Para id="_509">(Refer to <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062739#_403" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/depression-hp-pdq">Table 2</SummaryRef> in the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062739" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/depression-hp-pdq">Depression</SummaryRef> for antidepressant dosing.

been treated with a benzodiazepine and in those who may abuse benzodiazepines
(e.g., those with a history of illicit substance abuse or alcoholism). 
Buspirone is also useful in the geriatric population to augment fluoxetine for the treatment of anxiety and depression.  The beginning dose is
5 mg   3 times a day and can be increased to 15 mg  3 times a day. 
Buspirone can also be given twice a day.</Para><Para id="_485">The use of specific classes of medications is considered for managing treatment-refractory anxiety symptoms or in certain special clinical situations. Low-dose neuroleptics (e.g.,
thioridazine, 10 mg  3 times a day; and risperidone, 1 mg twice a day) are used to treat severe anxiety
when an adequate dose of a benzodiazepine is ineffective or if the patient
might be expected to respond poorly to benzodiazepines (e.g., patients with
brain metastases).  Low-dose neuroleptics can also be used when benzodiazepines
are not helpful or when there is the possibility of delirium, dementia, or
other complications. Low-dose anticonvulsants (e.g., pregabalin, 200 mg per day) are sometimes used to treat severe treatment-resistant anxiety when other medications are ineffective or contraindicated  because of certain associated risks.<Reference refidx="26"/> Generally, the use of neuroleptics or anticonvulsants is considered after adequate trials with several first-line agents (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, and benzodiazepines) because of  the significant side effect burden and potential for drug-drug interactions with these agents. Consultation with a psychiatric clinician is strongly recommended before  these medications are used. Direct involvement of a psychiatric clinician is imperative for the management of patients receiving these medications.</Para><Para id="_526">The presence or absence of specific psychiatric or medical comorbidities is frequently a critical factor in the selection of pharmacological treatments. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions with other medications are also important factors to be considered in the selection of agents. Following are some examples of such factors and clinical situations driving the selection of pharmacological treatments:</Para><ItemizedList id="_533" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>When depressive symptoms are comorbid with anxiety, treatment with SSRIs, SNRIs, or other antidepressants is strongly considered.</ListItem><ListItem>When neuropathic pain is comorbid with anxiety symptoms, specific antidepressants with known efficacy in treating neuropathic pain (e.g., duloxetine and venlafaxine) are considered.</ListItem><ListItem> When hot flashes are comorbid with anxiety symptoms, specific agents with known efficacy in treating hot flashes (e.g., venlafaxine) are considered.</ListItem><ListItem>Specific medications with known side effects (e.g., nausea with duloxetine or risk of sedation with mirtazapine) are avoided when patients are already experiencing these side effects from their cancer treatments and because of the possible exacerbation of these side effects. </ListItem><ListItem>Patients who are treated with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine) and tamoxifen may be at  risk of significant drug-drug interactions.
