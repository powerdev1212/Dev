into adjacent liver or biliary lymph nodes or has disseminated throughout the
peritoneal cavity.  Spread to distant parts of the body is not uncommon.  At this
stage, standard therapy is directed at palliation.  Because of its rarity, no
specific clinical trials exist; however, such patients can be included in
trials aimed at improving local control by combining radiation therapy with
radiosensitizer drugs.
