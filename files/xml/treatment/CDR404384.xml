Activity-related <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045618">biomarkers</GlossaryTermRef> were kept in a constant concentration from lot to lot.

These studies, many of which enrolled small numbers of patients, did not identify the source of the lots  that were used in the trials, nor did they identify where patients acquired PC-SPES.</Para><Para id="_59">In addition to the confounding effects of adulterants on the clinical trial results discussed below, the fact that an optimal <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044664">dose</GlossaryTermRef> of PC-SPES remains undetermined and  that dose varies among these studies makes it difficult to compare their findings.

</Para><Para id="_39">In a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044956">retrospective study</GlossaryTermRef> of 23 consecutive patients with AI disease, charts were evaluated for patients’ <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044085">responses</GlossaryTermRef> to PC-SPES and the occurrence of any toxicity.  There is no report of where the patients acquired their PC-SPES or what lots were used.  Patients were all seen between February and November in 1999.  Patients ranged in age from 51 to 88 years, with a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044941">median</GlossaryTermRef> age of 70 years.  All had previous initial <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044369">androgen ablation</GlossaryTermRef> for a period of 6 months to 144 months. Ten patients had received <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045214">chemotherapy</GlossaryTermRef>, 13 had not.

The <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046580">side effects</GlossaryTermRef> were similar to those of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046076">estrogen</GlossaryTermRef> therapy (gynecomastia and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000321376">impotence</GlossaryTermRef>).    Other side effects were nausea/vomiting and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000306496">diarrhea</GlossaryTermRef> and to a lesser extent, allergic reactions, leg cramps, and leg swelling.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_40">In a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044079">prospective</GlossaryTermRef> clinical trial of 16 men with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045885">stage</GlossaryTermRef> D3 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044058">metastatic</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046539">prostate</GlossaryTermRef> cancer in which all patients had failed therapy and had <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045669">disease progression</GlossaryTermRef>, the effects of PC-SPES on pain, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef>, and side effects were assessed.  Previous therapy was either <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000318820">orchidectomy</GlossaryTermRef> or a luteinizing hormone–releasing <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046054">agonist</GlossaryTermRef> with or without <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046052">antiandrogen</GlossaryTermRef>.   <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046367">Hormonal therapy</GlossaryTermRef> was continued throughout the trial to avoid the known withdrawal effect of antiandrogen on PSA levels.  There was a significant decrease in pain scores such that the 14 patients on <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045590">analgesics</GlossaryTermRef> required an average of 40% less analgesics while taking PC-SPES. PC-SPES treatment was associated with improved function and emotional and physical well-being.  PSA levels declined significantly after PC-SPES therapy (&gt;50%).  Side effects were <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000304766">breast</GlossaryTermRef> tenderness, deep venous <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044231">thrombosis</GlossaryTermRef>, and mild dyspepsia.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_41">In a study of 70 patients, 37 with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045592">androgen</GlossaryTermRef>-dependent (AD) disease and 33 with AI disease, the AD cohort was treated with PC-SPES only  after an initial treatment with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045851">prostatectomy</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045072">radiation</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045985">cryotherapy</GlossaryTermRef>, and/or hormonal therapy.  Median duration of PSA <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044085">response</GlossaryTermRef> was greater than 57 weeks. All patients in the AD cohort had PSA declines within  a range of 80% to 100%, and two patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045317">bone metastases</GlossaryTermRef> showed improvement on radiographic <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000390238">analysis</GlossaryTermRef>.  Within the AI cohort, 54% (19 of 35) had a PSA decrease of greater than 50%, with median time to nadir of 10 weeks and a median duration of 18 weeks.  Eight of the 16 patients who had received <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045222">ketoconazole</GlossaryTermRef> therapy prior to PC-SPES also obtained a decrease of greater than 50% in their PSA values. <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045581">Testosterone</GlossaryTermRef> levels within the AD group decreased to castrate levels (&lt;50 ng/mL) in 94% of patients (31 of 33), and libido (25 of 25) and potency (15 of 15) were lost in all patients who entered the study.  Side effects were <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000256567">hot flashes</GlossaryTermRef>, gynecomastia/gynecodynia, and thromboembolic effects in 3 of 70 patients. Although the results of this trial were promising for the treatment of both AI and AD prostate cancer, it is not possible to assess what was responsible for these effects. This trial used PC-SPES from one single lot, but the published study does not indicate the lot number.  The research was completed before 2000. No attempt was made to assess the possible contamination of the product.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_42">A prospective <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044010">clinical series</GlossaryTermRef> assessed the ability of PC-SPES to lower <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044088">serum</GlossaryTermRef> PSA levels in 33 prostate cancer patients.
