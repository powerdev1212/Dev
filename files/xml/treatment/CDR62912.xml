Surgical resection is the preferred treatment of patients who can tolerate
surgery and have a mediastinal mass that is suspected of being a thymoma.  A complete, surgical resection is recommended for patients with either stage I or stage II disease. A
complete resection of all tumors can be achieved in nearly
all stage I and stage II patients and in 27% to 44% of stage III patients. 
Postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) is generally employed for stage II and stage III
patients.  Patients with stage IVa disease can only rarely be resected
