The hypopharynx is  composed of the following three parts and does not include the larynx:</Para><ItemizedList id="_189" Style="bullet"><ListItem>The pyriform sinus.</ListItem><ListItem>The postcricoid area.</ListItem><ListItem>The posterior pharyngeal wall.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_217"><Title>Clinical Features</Title><Para id="_133"> The lymphatic drainage from the pharynx is into the jugulodigastric, jugulo-omohyoid, upper and middle deep cervical, and retropharyngeal nodes.  In the United States and Canada, 65% to 85% of hypopharyngeal carcinomas involve the pyriform sinuses, 10% to 20% involve the posterior pharyngeal wall, and 5% to 15% involve the postcricoid area.<Reference refidx="12"/>  Pyriform sinus and postcricoid carcinomas are typically flat plaques with raised edges and superficial ulceration. In contrast, posterior hypopharyngeal wall tumors tend to be exophytic and are often large (i.e., 80% &gt;5 cm) at presentation.<Reference refidx="13"/>  Hypopharyngeal carcinomas tend to spread within the mucosa, beneath intact epithelium, and are prone to skip metastasis  and to resurface at various locations remote from the primary site.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="13"/>  Because of this fact and the abundant lymphatic network of the region, a localized hypopharyngeal tumor is the exception.<Reference refidx="1"/>  </Para><Para id="_134">Almost all hypopharyngeal cancers are mucosal squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs).<Reference refidx="1"/>  Multiple primary tumors are not uncommon.  Approximately 25% of patients in a retrospective study of 150 cases were found to have second primary tumors.<Reference refidx="14"/>  Field cancerization may be responsible, in part, for the multiple, synchronous, primary malignant neoplasms that occur in patients with hypopharyngeal cancer.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/>  The concept of field cancerization, originally described in 1953, proposes that tumors develop in a multifocal fashion within a field of tissue that has been chronically exposed to carcinogens.<Reference refidx="17"/></Para><Para id="_135">Clinically, cancers of the hypopharynx tend to be aggressive and demonstrate a natural history that is characterized by diffuse local spread, early metastasis, and a relatively high rate of distant spread. More than  50% of patients with hypopharyngeal cancer have clinically positive cervical nodes at the time of presentation.  In 50% of these individuals, a neck mass is the presenting symptom.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/>  In a retrospective study of 78 cases of hypopharyngeal cancer, other symptoms in addition to a neck mass (25.6%) included dysphagia (46.1%), odynophagia (44.8%), voice change (16.3%), and otalgia (14.2%).<Reference refidx="2"/>  A voice change due to pyriform sinus or postcricoid lesions is a late symptom that usually indicates invasion into the larynx or the recurrent laryngeal nerve.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_136">In a large, retrospective study of patients with SCC of the larynx and hypopharynx, 87% of patients with pyriform sinus SCC were found to have stage III or stage IV disease; 82% of patients with SCC of the posterior pharyngeal wall were found to have stage III or stage IV disease.<Reference refidx="20"/>   As many as  17% of hypopharyngeal SCCs may be associated with distant metastases when clinically diagnosed.<Reference refidx="20"/>  This is quite different from the rate of distant metastasis detected at autopsy, which has been reported to be as much as 60%.<Reference refidx="21"/>  A relatively high incidence of delayed regional (i.e., 2 or more years after completion of primary therapy) and distant metastatic disease in hypopharyngeal SCC is related to the advanced stage of the disease at diagnosis.  Almost 33% of pyriform sinus tumors may be associated with delayed regional metastases.<Reference refidx="20"/></Para><Para id="_137">The treatment of hypopharyngeal cancer is controversial, in part because of its low incidence and the inherent difficulty in conducting adequately powered, prospective, randomized clinical studies.<Reference refidx="22"/>  Therefore, it is difficult to define the ideal therapy for a specific site or stage of hypopharyngeal cancer. In general, both surgery and radiation therapy are the mainstays of most curative efforts aimed at this cancer. In recent years, chemotherapy has been added to the treatment strategies for selected advanced presentations of hypopharyngeal cancer.<Reference refidx="23"/> In pyriform sinus cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy may afford larynx preservation without jeopardizing survival.<Reference refidx="24"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_218"><Title>Prognosis and Survival</Title><Para id="_138">Chronic pulmonary and hepatic diseases related to the excessive use of tobacco and alcohol are found in patients with hypopharyngeal cancer.

Most treatment failures occur within the first 2 years following definitive therapy. The burden of lymph node metastases may yield information of prognostic value. In a retrospective study, a total volume of metastatic disease of more than 100 cm<Superscript>3</Superscript> indicated a particularly poor prognosis.<Reference refidx="25"/>  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_219"><Title>Risk Factors</Title><Para id="_140">In addition to the risk of delayed regional metastases, the risk of developing a second primary tumor in patients with tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract has been estimated to be 4% to 7% per year.<Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/>   Because of these risks, surveillance of patients with hypopharyngeal cancer should be lifelong. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_220"><Title>Histopathology</Title><Para id="_141">To date, SCC of the hypopharynx has not been associated with any specific chromosomal or genetic abnormalities;<Reference refidx="13"/>   however, loss of chromosome 18 was observed in 57% of hypopharyngeal tumors in one study.<Reference refidx="29"/>  Several other studies have emphasized the importance of chromosome 11q13 amplification, which may be related to the presence of nodal metastases, greater local aggressiveness, and a higher incidence of tumor recurrence.<Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Mendenhall WM, Werning JW, Pfister DG: Treatment of head and neck cancer.

multidisciplinary input to establish the optimal treatment regimen.  New
surgical techniques and reconstructions using the gastric pull-up operation or
free jejunal transfers have greatly reduced the morbidity associated with
resection of these tumors and have almost eliminated the need for multistage
reconstructions.  This has greatly aided the combined treatment regimens 
because these patients have a high likelihood of beginning postoperative
radiation therapy within 3 to 4 weeks following resection.
</Para><Para id="_90">Details of surgical procedures and their modifications of radiation fields or
dosage schedules are not specifically designated here because of
legitimate variations in techniques that,  according to various retrospective
data, give similar survival results in different treatment centers.  This group
of patients should be managed by surgeons and radiation oncologists who are
skilled in the multiple procedures and techniques available, and who are
actively and frequently involved in the care of these patients.

become the usual form of therapy for this group of patients in the United
States.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>
</ListItem><ListItem>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy as given in clinical trials has been used to shrink
tumors and render them more definitively treatable with either surgery
or radiation. Chemotherapy is given prior to the other modalities, hence the
designation, neoadjuvant, to distinguish it from standard adjuvant therapy, which
is given after or during definitive therapy with radiation or after surgery. 
Many drug combinations have been used in neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is commonly used to treat patients presenting with
advanced disease to  improve locoregional control or survival, despite the
lack of data from randomized, prospective trials.<Reference refidx="3"/>  The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to increase organ
preservation has also been advocated.  In a prospective randomized trial, referred to as the   GORTEC-TREMPLIN trial (<ProtocolRef href="CDR0000453500" nct_id="NCT00169247">NCT00169247</ProtocolRef>), the
European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer compared  surgery plus PORT to induction
chemotherapy (i.e., cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]) followed by radiation in responding
patients.<Reference refidx="4"/>  Local and regional failures were similar in both groups.  Although
median survival was 25 months in the immediate surgery arm of the study and 44
months in the induction chemotherapy arm (<Emphasis>P </Emphasis>= .006), 5-year disease-free and
overall survival (OS) were the same.  A functional larynx was preserved in 42% of
patients at 3 years and 35% at 5 years in patients who were receiving induction
chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="4"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335125">Level of evidence: 1iiA</LOERef>, <LOERef href="CDR0000335127">1iiC</LOERef>]    In contrast to this, another randomized, prospective
trial has demonstrated a statistically significant survival advantage for patients
undergoing chemotherapy (i.e., cisplatin plus 5-FU) followed by laryngopharyngectomy 
and PORT when compared with  chemotherapy and radiation
therapy.<Reference refidx="5"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335125">Level of evidence: 1iiA</LOERef>,<LOERef href="CDR0000335127">1iiC</LOERef>]  Although organ preservation was not
