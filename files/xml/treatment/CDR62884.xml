Although this rate of increase is faster than any other skin cancer including melanoma, the absolute number of U.S. cases per year is small.

The prognostic significance of viral load, antibody titer levels, and the role of underlying immunosuppression in hosts (from disease and medications) are under investigation. </Para><Para id="_316">Prevalence of  MCPyV appears to differ between MCC patients in the the United States and Europe versus Australia. It has been suggested that there may be two independent pathways for the development of MCC: one driven by the presence of MCPyV, and the other driven primarily by sun damage, especially as noted in patient series from Australia.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="31"/> </Para><Para id="_255">Although no unique marker for MCC has been identified, a variety of molecular and cytogenetic markers of MCC have been reported.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="14"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_256"><Title>Clinical Presentation</Title><Para id="_257">MCC usually presents as a painless, indurated, solitary dermal nodule with a slightly erythematous to deeply violaceous color, and rarely, an ulcer. MCC can infiltrate locally via dermal lymphatics, resulting in multiple satellite lesions. Because of its nonspecific clinical appearance, MCC is rarely suspected prior to biopsy.<Reference refidx="3"/> Photographs of MCC skin lesions illustrate its clinical variability.<Reference refidx="32"/></Para><Para id="_258">A mnemonic <Reference refidx="16"/> summarizing typical clinical characteristics of MCC has been proposed:  </Para><ItemizedList id="_259" Style="bullet"><ListTitle>AEIOU</ListTitle><ListItem>A = Asymptomatic.</ListItem><ListItem>E = Expanding rapidly.</ListItem><ListItem>I = Immune suppressed.</ListItem><ListItem>O = Older than 50 years.</ListItem><ListItem>U = UV-exposed skin.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_260">Not all patients have every element in this mnemonic; however, in this study, 89% of patients met three or more criteria, 52% met four or more criteria, and 7% met all five criteria.<Reference refidx="16"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_261"><Title>Initial Clinical Evaluation</Title><Para id="_262">Because local-regional spread is common, newly diagnosed MCC patients require a careful clinical examination that includes looking for satellite lesions and regional nodal involvement. </Para><Para id="_263">An imaging work-up should be tailored to the clinical presentation as well as any relevant signs and symptoms. There has been no systematic study of the optimal imaging work-up for newly diagnosed patients, and it is not clear if all newly diagnosed patients, especially those with the smallest primaries, benefit from a detailed imaging work-up. </Para><Para id="_264">If an imaging work-up is performed, it may include a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen to rule out primary small cell lung cancer as well as distant and regional metastases. Imaging studies designed to evaluate suspicious signs and symptoms may also be recommended. In one series, CT scans had an 80% false-negative rate for regional metastases.<Reference refidx="33"/> Head and neck presentations may require additional imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging has been used to evaluate MCC but has not been studied systematically.<Reference refidx="34"/> Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography results have been reported only in selected cases.<Reference refidx="35"/><Reference refidx="36"/> Routine blood work as a baseline has been recommended but has not been studied systematically. There are no known circulating tumor markers specifically for MCC.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_265"><Title>Initial Staging Results</Title><Para id="_266">The results of initial clinical staging of MCC vary widely in the literature, based on retrospective case series reported over decades. In 2009, 3,870 MCC cases were reported from the SEER Program registry.  For invasive cancers, 48.6% were localized, 31.1% were regional, and 8.2% were distant.<Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Para id="_267">MCC that presents in regional nodes without an identifiable primary lesion is found in a minority of patients, with the percent of these cases varying among the reported series. Tumors without an identifiable primary lesion have been attributed to either spontaneous regression of the primary or metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma from a clinically occult site.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="37"/><Reference refidx="38"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_268"><Title>Clinical Progression</Title><Para id="_269">In a review of patients from 18 case series, 279 of 926 patients (30.1%) developed local recurrence during follow-up, excluding those presenting with distant metastatic disease. These events have been typically attributed to inadequate surgical margins and/or a lack of adjuvant radiation therapy. In addition, 545 of 982 patients (55.5%) had lymph node metastases at diagnosis or during follow-up.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_270">In the same review of 18 case series, the most common sites of distant metastases were distant lymph nodes (60.1%), distant skin (30.3%), lung (23.4%), central nervous system (18.4%), and bone (15.2%).<Reference refidx="6"/> Many other sites of disease have also been reported, and the distribution of metastatic sites varies among case series. </Para><Para id="_271">In one series of 237 patients presenting with local or regional disease, the median time-to-recurrence was 9 months (range, 2–70 months).  Ninety-one percent of recurrences occurred within 2 years of diagnosis.<Reference refidx="39"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_272"><Title>Potential Prognostic Factors</Title><Para id="_273">The extent of disease at presentation appears to provide the most useful estimate of prognosis.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_274">Diagnostic procedures, such as sentinel lymph node biopsy, may help distinguish between local and regional disease at presentation.  One-third of patients who lack clinically palpable or radiologically visible nodes will have microscopically evident regional disease.<Reference refidx="33"/> The likelihood is that nodal positivity may be substantially lower among patients with small tumors (e.g., ≤1.0 cm).<Reference refidx="40"/></Para><Para id="_275">Many retrospective studies have evaluated the relationship of a wide variety of biological and histological factors to survival and local-regional control.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="39"/><Reference refidx="41"/><Reference refidx="42"/><Reference refidx="43"/><Reference refidx="44"/><Reference refidx="45"/><Reference refidx="46"/><Reference refidx="47"/><Reference refidx="48"/><Reference refidx="49"/><Reference refidx="50"/><Reference refidx="51"/><Reference refidx="52"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335158">Level of evidence: 3iiiDiii</LOERef>] Many of these reports are confounded by small numbers, potential selection bias, referral bias, short follow-up, no uniform clinical protocol for both staging and treatment, and are underpowered to detect modest differences.</Para><Para id="_276">A large, single-institution, retrospective study of 156 MCC patients, with a median follow-up of 51 months (range 2–224 months), evaluated histologic factors potentially associated with prognosis.<Reference refidx="50"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335151">Level of evidence: 3iiiB</LOERef>]  Although this report is subject to potential selection and referral bias, both univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated a relationship between improved cause-specific survival and circumscribed growth pattern versus infiltrative pattern, shallow-tumor depth versus deep-tumor depth, and absence of lymphovascular invasion versus presence of lymphovascular invasion. Adoption of these findings into a global prognostic algorithm awaits independent confirmation by adequately powered studies. </Para><Para id="_277">A 2009 study investigated whether the presence of newly identified MCPyV in MCC tumor specimens influenced clinical outcome among 114 Finnish patients with MCC.

Most clinical management recommendations in the literature are based on case series that describe a relatively small number of patients who were not entered on formal clinical trials, evaluated with uniform clinical staging procedures, treated with uniform treatment protocols, or provided with regular, prescribed follow-up. These reports are also confounded by potential selection bias, referral bias, and short follow-up; and they are underpowered to detect modest differences in outcome. </Para><Para id="_206">In addition, outcomes of patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage IA, stage IB, and stage II are often reported together. In the absence of results from clinical trials with prescribed work-up, treatments, and follow-up, most MCC patients have been treated using institutional or practitioner preferences that consider the specifics of each case as well as patient preference.</Para><Para id="_207">Two competing philosophies underlie many of the controversies about the most appropriate method of treating MCC.  In the first philosophy, MCC is treated like other nonmelanoma skin cancers, with an emphasis on treating local-regional disease with surgery and radiation as appropriate.  In the second philosophy, MCC is treated according to its "biologic features."
