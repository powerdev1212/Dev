Drug-associated causes of hot flashes and night sweats in men and women include tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, and steroids.

Physicians and breast cancer survivors often think there is an increased risk of breast cancer recurrence or de novo breast malignancy with hormone replacement therapies and defer hormonal management of postmenopausal symptoms.

Tumors among women in the hormone replacement therapy group were slightly larger and more advanced than in the placebo group, with a substantial and statistically significant rise in the percentage of abnormal mammograms at first annual screening; such a rise might hinder breast cancer diagnosis and account for the later stage at diagnosis.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] These results are supported by a population-based case-control study suggesting a 1.7-fold (95% CI, 1.3–2.2) increased risk of breast cancer in women using combined hormone replacement therapy.

Sixty-six women with histories of breast cancer were randomly assigned in an open-label fashion to receive venlafaxine or gabapentin for 4 weeks; after a 2-week washout period, they received the opposite treatment for an additional 4 weeks. Both treatments reduced hot flash scores (severity multiplied by frequency) by about 66%. However, significantly more women preferred venlafaxine over gabapentin (68% vs. 32%, respectively).<Reference refidx="23"/></Para><Para id="_218">A study using citalopram to evaluate hot flashes examined how much of a reduction in hot flashes was needed to have a positive impact on activities of daily living and general health-related quality of life.<Reference refidx="24"/> The authors reported that hot flashes had to be reduced at least 46% for women to report significant improvements in the degree of bother they experienced in daily activities.</Para><Para id="_219">Agents that have been evaluated in phase II trials but have not shown efficacy include bupropion,<Reference refidx="25"/> aprepitant,<Reference refidx="26"/> and desipramine.<Reference refidx="27"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] Interestingly, these agents do not primarily modulate serotonin. In addition, randomized clinical trials with sertraline have not provided convincing evidence of its efficacy in hot flash management.<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_220">If nighttime hot flashes or night sweats are a particular problem without causing much bother during daytime, strategies to simultaneously improve sleep and hot flashes are in order. Limited data exist related to effective treatments that can target both symptoms. One pilot trial evaluated mirtazapine (a tetracyclic antidepressant that mainly affects serotonin) for hot flashes because it is often prescribed for sleep difficulties. Twenty-two women were titrated up to 30 mg per day of mirtazapine at bedtime over a 3-week period; then they could choose 15 mg or 30 mg at bedtime daily for the fourth week. Hot flashes were reduced about 53% in this nonrandomized trial, and women were statistically significantly satisfied with their hot flash control.<Reference refidx="31"/> However, only 16 of the 22 women stayed on the agent for the entire study period because of excessive grogginess. Therefore, although this agent could be further studied in a larger randomized trial, it would be particularly important to evaluate the risk/benefit ratio.</Para><Para id="_221">Trazodone is another possible agent to use for nighttime hot flashes, based on clinical experience. Trazodone, an atypical antidepressant that is often used as a sleeping aid, has anecdotally been shown to be particularly helpful in patients with nocturnal hot flashes. Doses range from 50 mg to 300 mg. Clinical experience suggests that trazodone can help patients fall asleep and can control hot flashes during the night, helping them to stay asleep. Trazodone is a tricyclic antidepressant and, as such, would not be expected to have a great impact on hot flashes: one open-label pilot trial conducted with a tricyclic antidepressant, desipramine, as a proof-of-principle study did not show a benefit.<Reference refidx="27"/> However, this study has not been replicated. The effect of trazodone on sleep may be so profound that hot flashes are not bothersome; this hypothesis needs further study.</Para><Para id="_222">Side effects for antidepressant agents in the doses used to treat hot flashes are minimal in the short term and primarily include nausea, sedation, dry mouth, and appetite suppression or stimulation. In the long term, the prevalence of decreased sexual function with the use of SSRIs at doses for treating hot flashes is not known. The anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin can cause sedation, dizziness, and difficulty concentrating, while clonidine can cause dry mouth, sedation, constipation, and insomnia.<Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="19"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] Patients respond as individuals to both the efficacy and the toxicity of various medications. Therefore, careful assessment and tailored treatment chosen collaboratively by provider and health care consumer are needed.</Para><Para id="_223">Data indicate that if one medication is not helpful for an individual, switching to another medication—whether a different antidepressant or gabapentin—may be worthwhile. In a randomized phase III trial (<ProtocolRef href="CDR0000374993" nct_id="NCT00087399">NCCTG-N03C5</ProtocolRef>) of gabapentin alone versus gabapentin in conjunction with an antidepressant in women who had inadequate control of their hot flashes with an antidepressant alone,<Reference refidx="32"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] gabapentin use resulted in an approximately 50% median reduction in hot flash frequency and score, regardless of whether the antidepressant was continued. In other words, for women who were using antidepressants exclusively for the management of hot flashes that were inadequately controlled, initiation of gabapentin with discontinuation of the antidepressant produced results equal to those obtained with combined therapy, resulting in the need for fewer medications. Similarly, in a pilot study of women receiving inadequate benefit from venlafaxine for hot flash reduction, switching to open-label citalopram, 20 mg per day, resulted in a 50% reduction in hot flash frequency and score.<Reference refidx="33"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_224"><Title>Drug Interactions</Title><Para id="_225">Many of the SSRIs can inhibit the cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in the metabolism of tamoxifen, which is commonly used in the treatment of breast cancer.  When SSRIs are being used, drug-drug interactions are noted.  Tamoxifen, used in the management of breast cancer, is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, specifically CYP2D6.  Wild-type CYP2D6 metabolizes tamoxifen to an active metabolite, 4-hydroxy-N-desmethyl-tamoxifen, also known as endoxifen. A prospective trial evaluating the effects of the coadministration of tamoxifen and  paroxetine, a CYP2D6 inhibitor, on tamoxifen metabolism, found that paroxetine coadministration resulted in decreased concentrations of endoxifen.    The magnitude of decrease was greater in women with the wild-type CYP2D6 genotype than in those with a variant genotype (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .03).<Reference refidx="34"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_226">In a prospective observational study of 80 women initiating adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for newly diagnosed breast cancer, variant CYP2D6 genotypes and concomitant use of SSRI CYP2D6 inhibitors resulted in reduced endoxifen levels.  Variant CYP2D6 genotypes do not produce functional CYP2D6 enzymes.<Reference refidx="35"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] Since this study was published, several researchers have been evaluating the clinical implications of this finding.<Reference refidx="36"/>;<Reference refidx="37"/><Reference refidx="38"/><Reference refidx="39"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]  One study followed more than 1,300 women for a median of 6.3 years and concluded that women who were poor metabolizers or heterozygous extensive/intermediate metabolizers (hence, less CYP2D6 activity) had higher rates of recurrence, worse event-free survival, and worse disease-free survival than did women who were extensive metabolizers.<Reference refidx="38"/>  Similarly, a retrospective cohort study of more than 2,400 women in Ontario who were being treated with tamoxifen and had overlapping treatment with an SSRI has been completed.  Authors concluded that women who concomitantly used paroxetine and tamoxifen had an increased risk of death that was proportionate to the amount of time they used these agents together.<Reference refidx="39"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_227">The clinical implications of these changes and of other CYP2D6 genotypes <Reference refidx="40"/> have not yet been elucidated, but the pharmacokinetic interaction between tamoxifen and the newer antidepressants used to treat hot flashes merits further study.<Reference refidx="41"/> Likewise, the risk of soy phytoestrogen use on breast cancer recurrence and/or progression has not yet been clarified.  Soy phytoestrogens are weak estrogens found in plant foods.   <Emphasis>In vitro</Emphasis> models suggest that these compounds have a biphasic effect on mammary cell proliferation that is dependent on intracellular concentrations of phytoestrogen and  estradiol.<Reference refidx="42"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_228"><Title>Information Specific to Men</Title><Para id="_229">Data regarding the pathophysiology and management of hot flashes in men with prostate cancer are scant. The limited data that exist suggest that hot flashes in men are related to changes in sex hormone levels that cause instability in the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center analogous to the proposed mechanism of hot flashes that occur in women. As in women with breast cancer, hot flashes impair the quality of life for men with prostate cancer who are receiving androgen deprivation therapy. The vasodilatory neuropeptide, calcitonin gene–related peptide, may be instrumental in the genesis of hot flashes. With the exception of clonidine, the agents mentioned previously (refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062742#_214" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/sexuality-fertility-women/hot-flashes-hp-pdq">Other Pharmacologic Interventions</SummaryRef> section of this summary) that have been found effective for hot flashes have shown similar rates of efficacy when studied in men. Treatment modalities include estrogens, progesterone, SSRIs, gabapentin 300 mg 3 times per day as an option for men,<Reference refidx="43"/> and cyproterone acetate, an antiandrogen. Cyproterone acetate is not available in the United States.</Para><Para id="_230">One large, multisite study from France <Reference refidx="44"/> randomly assigned men who were taking leuprorelin for prostate cancer to receive venlafaxine, 75 mg; cyproterone acetate (an antiandrogen), 100 mg; or medroxyprogesterone acetate, 20 mg, when they reported at least 14 hot flashes per week. All three treatments significantly reduced hot flashes, with cyproterone resulting in a 100% median reduction, medroxyprogesterone resulting in a 97% reduction, and venlafaxine resulting in a 57% reduction at 8 weeks. More adverse events were reported with cyproterone acetate, including one serious adverse event (dyspnea) attributable to the drug. Venlafaxine was not associated with any serious adverse events and overall had a 20% adverse event rate attributable to the drug. Medroxyprogesterone was the most well-tolerated drug, with an adverse event rate of 12%, but with one serious event, urticaria. The most frequent side effects for all agents were related to gastrointestinal issues: nausea, constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.<Reference refidx="44"/></Para><Para id="_231">Pilot studies of the efficacy of the SSRIs paroxetine and fluvoxamine suggest that these drugs decrease the frequency and severity of hot flashes in men with prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="45"/><Reference refidx="46"/> As in women with hormonally sensitive tumors, there are concerns about the effects of hormone use on the outcome of prostate cancer, in addition to other well-described side effects.<Reference refidx="47"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_232"><Title>Cognitive and Behavioral Methods</Title><Para id="_233">Comprehensive nonpharmacologic interventions have been developed and evaluated for their ability to reduce hot flashes, night sweats, and the perception of burden or problems related to hot flashes and night sweats. These interventions have typically included the following:<Reference refidx="48"/><Reference refidx="49"/><Reference refidx="50"/><Reference refidx="51"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_234" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Psychoeducation about managing general symptoms, including stress, anxiety, and sexual and other menopausal concerns.</ListItem><ListItem>Relaxation exercises, including slow, deep breathing, called paced breathing.</ListItem><ListItem>Cognitive restructuring that addresses catastrophizing, negative beliefs, and avoidance behaviors.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_235">Behavioral interventions as a primary or adjunctive
modality may also play a role in hot flash management. Core body temperature has been shown to increase before a hot flash;<Reference refidx="52"/>  therefore, interventions that control body temperature could improve hot flash management.  Some methods of controlling body temperature include the use of loose-fitting cotton clothing and the use of fans and open windows to keep air circulating.  On the basis of the theory that serotonin may be involved as a central hot flash trigger, behavioral interventions such as stress management may modulate serotonin, causing a decrease in hot flashes.</Para><Para id="_236">Relaxation training and slow, deep breathing (paced breathing) were initially found to decrease hot flash intensity by as much as 40% to 50% in controlled pilot trials;<Reference refidx="53"/><Reference refidx="54"/> however, randomized trials with control arms using a different pace of breathing have not demonstrated significant benefit for paced-breathing interventions.<Reference refidx="55"/><Reference refidx="56"/></Para><Para id="_237">Three large studies <Reference refidx="49"/><Reference refidx="50"/><Reference refidx="51"/> with similar interventions have been completed using no treatment, usual care, or wait-list control comparison groups.  While all of the studies demonstrated significant reductions in problem ratings or bother ratings related to hot flashes and night sweats, none showed actual reductions in hot flash frequency.  Only one of the three studies demonstrated some significant improvements in night sweats at some data points.<Reference refidx="50"/> Cognitive behavioral interventions may be an important addition to pharmacological treatment to improve a patient’s overall experience with symptoms related to hot flashes.  However, data have not supported the sole use of cognitive behavior therapy for reducing hot flashes.</Para><Para id="_238">Medical hypnosis is a newer intervention for hot flashes that has been shown to be helpful.  In medical hypnosis, the provider facilitates a deep relaxation and trance state and, with the patient  in that state, gives suggestions to the subconscious that would mitigate the symptom or problem being addressed.  For hot flashes, medical hypnosis uses cooling suggestions and stress reduction to prevent rises in core body temperature and to decrease sympathetic activation.  On the basis of strong pilot data, a randomized controlled trial with 187 postmenopausal women used an attention-control comparison and demonstrated significantly greater reductions in hot flashes in the hypnosis group than in the control group.   The hypnosis intervention was 5 weeks long.  At week 6, hot flash frequency was reduced in the hypnosis group 64%, compared with a 9% reduction in the control group.  At week 12, the reduction in the hypnosis group was 75%, compared with a 17% reduction in the control group.<Reference refidx="57"/>  Cancer survivors were not included in this study, but previous research has not demonstrated that interventions have a differential effect on hot flashes based on breast cancer history.</Para><Para id="_239">Future research on hot flash management may be aided by the development of psychometrically sound assessment tools such as the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale, which evaluates the impact of hot flashes on a wide variety of daily activities.<Reference refidx="58"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_240"><Title>Integrative Approaches</Title><SummarySection id="_241"><Title>Herbs/dietary supplements</Title><Para id="_242">Numerous herbs and dietary supplements are popularly used for hot flash reduction.

Flaxseed is also a source of fiber.  Lignans are a type of phytoestrogen (plant estrogen) that, like soy, is thought to have estrogen agonist-antagonist effects as well as antioxidant properties.  Lignans are converted by colonic bacteria to enterodiol and enterolactone, which are metabolites believed to have important physiological properties such as decreasing cell proliferation and inhibiting aromatase, 5-alpha reductase, and 17-beta hydroxysteroid activity.  Cell line studies have shown properties of aromatase inhibition with enterolactone but less so with enterodiol.<Reference refidx="73"/> It is thought that these properties can reduce the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers.<Reference refidx="74"/><Reference refidx="75"/><Reference refidx="76"/>  In addition, studies have shown that  flaxseed can reduce estrogen levels through excretion in the urine.<Reference refidx="77"/><Reference refidx="78"/></Para><Para id="_252">On the basis of preliminary data testing flaxseed for its effect on hot flashes and related endpoints,<Reference refidx="79"/><Reference refidx="80"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] an open-label pilot study was conducted to evaluate 40 g of flaxseed in decreasing hot flashes.

Some of these products are plant phytoestrogens, and some have unknown properties.  The agents include dong quai, milk thistle, red clover, licorice, and chaste tree berry. There is incomplete understanding of the biology of these agents and whether taking them would impact breast cancer risk or recurrence in a negative or positive way.  Data suggest that these plants have different effects, dependent not only on the dose used but also on a woman's hormone environment when she takes them.  Little is known about these agents, and caution with respect to taking them—if a woman is to avoid estrogen supplementation—is needed.  <Reference refidx="83"/><Reference refidx="84"/><Reference refidx="85"/><Reference refidx="86"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_254"><Title>Acupuncture</Title><Para id="_255">Pilot and randomized sham trials have evaluated the use of acupuncture to treat hot flashes.<Reference refidx="87"/><Reference refidx="88"/><Reference refidx="89"/><Reference refidx="90"/><Reference refidx="91"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]  Research in acupuncture is difficult to conduct, owing to the lack of novel methodology—specifically, the conundrum of what serves as an adequate control arm.  In addition, the philosophy surrounding acupuncture practice is quite individualized, in that two women experiencing hot flashes would not necessarily receive the same treatment.   It would be important to study acupuncture utilizing relevant clinical procedures; so far, acceptable research methods to accomplish this are lacking.  Therefore, the data with respect to the effect of acupuncture on hot flashes are quite mixed, with many studies suffering from ineffective control arms. Therefore, as concluded in at least one review, there is not a body of evidence to definitively delineate the role or practice of acupuncture for hot flashes.<Reference refidx="92"/> (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000445441#_153" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/acupuncture-pdq">Vasomotor symptoms</SummaryRef> section  in the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000445441" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/acupuncture-pdq">Acupuncture</SummaryRef> for more information.)</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="11872200" MedlineID="21861737">Freedman RR, Blacker CM: Estrogen raises the sweating threshold in postmenopausal women with hot flashes.
