nonmelanoma skin cancer, and it is the second leading cause of cancer deaths after
lung cancer.  In 2015, an estimated 234,190 new cases  will be diagnosed, and
40,730 deaths from breast cancer  will occur.<Reference refidx="1"/> The incidence of breast cancer, particularly for estrogen receptor–positive cancers occurring after age 50 years, is declining and has declined at a faster rate since 2003; this may be temporally related to a decrease in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after early reports from the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI).<Reference refidx="2"/> An estimated 21,290 new cases of ovarian cancer are expected in 2015, with an estimated 14,180 deaths.

A reported family history may be erroneous, or a person may be unaware of relatives affected with cancer.  In
addition, small family sizes and premature deaths may limit the information
obtained from a family history.  Breast or ovarian cancer on the
paternal side of the family usually involves more distant relatives than does breast or ovarian cancer on the
maternal side, so information  may be more difficult to obtain.
When self-reported information is compared with independently verified cases, the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000322883">sensitivity</GlossaryTermRef> of a history of breast cancer is relatively high, at 83% to 97%, but lower for ovarian cancer, at 60%.<Reference refidx="99"/><Reference refidx="100"/> Additional  limitations of relying on family histories include adoption; families with a small number of women; limited access to family history information; and incidental removal of the uterus, ovaries, and/or fallopian tubes for noncancer indications.  Family histories will evolve, therefore it is important to update family histories from both parents over time.

age, a positive family history is the strongest known predictive risk factor
for breast cancer.  However, it has long been recognized that in some families, there is hereditary breast cancer, which is characterized by an early age of onset, bilaterality, and the presence of breast cancer in multiple generations in an apparent <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339338">autosomal dominant</GlossaryTermRef> pattern of transmission (through either the maternal or the paternal lineage), sometimes including tumors of other organs, particularly the ovary and prostate gland.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> It is now known that some of these “cancer families” can
be explained by specific <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046063">mutations</GlossaryTermRef> in single cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460209">susceptibility genes</GlossaryTermRef>.  The
isolation of several of these <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045693">genes</GlossaryTermRef>, which when mutated are associated with a significantly
increased risk of breast/ovarian cancer, makes it possible to identify individuals at risk. Although such cancer susceptibility genes are very important, highly penetrant <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046384">germline mutations</GlossaryTermRef> are estimated to account for only 5% to 10% of breast cancers overall.
</Para><Para id="_2534">A 1988 study reported the first quantitative evidence that breast cancer
segregated as an autosomal dominant trait in some families.<Reference refidx="3"/> The search for genes associated with hereditary susceptibility to breast cancer
has been facilitated by studies of large <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460158">kindreds</GlossaryTermRef> with multiple affected
individuals and has led to the identification of several susceptibility genes,
including <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>, <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>, <GeneName>TP53</GeneName>, <GeneName>PTEN/MMAC1</GeneName>, and <GeneName>STK11</GeneName>.    
Other genes, such as the mismatch repair genes <GeneName>MLH1</GeneName>, <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName>, <GeneName>MSH6</GeneName>, and <GeneName>PMS2</GeneName>, have been associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, but have not been consistently associated with breast cancer.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_95"><Title><GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName></Title><Para id="_96">In 1990, a susceptibility gene for breast cancer was mapped by genetic <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460161">linkage</GlossaryTermRef>

between breast cancer and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046129">genetic markers</GlossaryTermRef> on chromosome 17q was soon confirmed
by others, and evidence for the coincident transmission of both breast and

Germline mutations in <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> are associated with early-onset breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and fallopian tube cancer.

In tumors associated with both <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutations,  there is often loss of the wild-type (nonmutated) <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339337">allele</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para><Para id="_1316">Mutations in <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> appear to be responsible for disease in 45% of families with multiple cases of breast cancer only and in up to 90% of families with both breast and ovarian cancer.<Reference refidx="16"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_99"><Title><GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> function</Title><Para id="_100">Most <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutations are predicted to produce a truncated protein product, and thus loss of protein function, although some <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460164">missense mutations</GlossaryTermRef> cause loss of function without truncation.  Because inherited breast/ovarian cancer is an autosomal dominant condition, persons with a <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> or <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutation on one copy of chromosome 17 or 13 also carry a normal allele on the other paired chromosome. 
In most breast and ovarian cancers that have been studied from mutation carriers, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460141">deletion</GlossaryTermRef> of the
normal allele results in loss of all function, leading to the classification of <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> as tumor suppressor genes.   In addition to, and as part of, their roles as tumor suppressor genes, <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> are involved in myriad functions within cells, including homologous <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045671">DNA</GlossaryTermRef> repair, genomic stability, transcriptional regulation, protein ubiquitination, chromatin remodeling, and cell cycle control.<Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_110"><Title>Mutations in <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName></Title><Para id="_111">Nearly 2,000 distinct mutations and sequence variations in <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> have

increased risk of cancer result in missing or nonfunctional proteins,
supporting the hypothesis that <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> are tumor suppressor genes. 
While a small number of these mutations have been found repeatedly in unrelated

</Para><Para id="_112">Mutation-screening methods vary in their <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000322883">sensitivity</GlossaryTermRef>.  Methods widely used in
research laboratories, such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460217">single-stranded conformational polymorphism</GlossaryTermRef>
analysis and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460136">conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis</GlossaryTermRef>, miss nearly a
third of the mutations that are detected by DNA sequencing.<Reference refidx="22"/>  In addition,
large genomic alterations such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000470251">translocations</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000712691">inversions</GlossaryTermRef>, or large deletions or insertions are missed by most of the techniques, including

There are no definitive functional tests for <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> or <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>; therefore, the classification of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460201">nucleotide</GlossaryTermRef> changes to predict their functional impact as deleterious or benign relies on imperfect data.  The majority of accepted deleterious mutations result in protein truncation and/or loss of important functional domains.  However, 10% to 15% of all individuals undergoing genetic testing with full sequencing of <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> will not have a clearly deleterious mutation detected but will have a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000556495">variant of uncertain (or unknown) significance</GlossaryTermRef> (VUS).  VUS may cause substantial challenges in counseling, particularly in terms of cancer risk estimates and risk management. Clinical management of such patients needs to be highly individualized and must take into consideration factors such as the patient’s personal and family cancer history, in addition to sources of information to help characterize the VUS as benign or deleterious. Thus an improved classification and reporting system may be of clinical utility.<Reference refidx="31"/></Para><Para id="_1197"> A comprehensive analysis of 7,461 consecutive full gene sequence analyses performed by Myriad Genetic Laboratories, Inc., described the frequency of VUS over a 3-year period.<Reference refidx="32"/>  Among subjects who had no clearly deleterious mutation, 13% had VUS defined as “missense mutations and mutations that occur in analyzed intronic regions whose clinical significance has not yet been determined, chain-terminating mutations that truncate BRCA1 and BRCA2 distal to amino acid positions 1853 and 3308, respectively, and mutations that eliminate the normal stop codons for these proteins.”  The classification of a sequence variant as a VUS is a moving target. An additional 6.8% of subjects with no clear deleterious mutations had sequence alterations that were once considered VUS but were reclassified as a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044805">polymorphism</GlossaryTermRef>, or occasionally as a deleterious mutation.  </Para><Para id="_2634">The frequency of VUS varies by ethnicity within the U.S. population. African Americans appear to have the highest rate of VUS.<Reference refidx="33"/> In a 2009 study of data from Myriad, 16.5% of individuals of African ancestry had VUS, the highest rate among all ethnicities. The frequency of VUS in Asian, Middle Eastern, and Hispanic populations clusters between 10% and 14%, although these numbers are based on limited sample sizes. Over time, the rate of changes classified as VUS has decreased in all ethnicities, largely the result of improved mutation classification algorithms.<Reference refidx="34"/> VUS continue to be reclassified as additional information is curated and interpreted.<Reference refidx="35"/><Reference refidx="36"/> Such information may impact the continuing care of affected individuals.</Para><Para id="_1198">A number of methods for discriminating deleterious from neutral VUS exist and others are in development <Reference refidx="37"/><Reference refidx="38"/><Reference refidx="39"/><Reference refidx="40"/> including integrated methods (see below).<Reference refidx="41"/> Interpretation of VUS is greatly aided by efforts to track VUS in the family to determine if there is <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460139">cosegregation</GlossaryTermRef> of the VUS with the cancer in the family. In general, a VUS observed in individuals who also have a deleterious mutation, especially when the same VUS has been identified in conjunction with different deleterious mutations, is less likely to be in itself deleterious, although there are rare exceptions. As an adjunct to the clinical information, models to interpret VUS have been developed, based on sequence conservation, biochemical properties of amino acid changes,<Reference refidx="37"/><Reference refidx="42"/><Reference refidx="43"/><Reference refidx="44"/><Reference refidx="45"/><Reference refidx="46"/>  incorporation of information on pathologic characteristics of <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>- and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>-related tumors (e.g., <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>-related breast cancers are usually estrogen receptor [ER]–negative),<Reference refidx="47"/> and functional studies to measure the influence of specific sequence variations on the activity of BRCA1 or BRCA2  proteins.<Reference refidx="48"/><Reference refidx="49"/> When attempting to interpret a VUS, all available information should be examined.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_113"><Title>Population estimates of the likelihood of having a <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> or <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutation</Title><Para id="_1962">Statistics regarding the percentage of individuals found to be <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation carriers among samples of women and men with a variety of personal cancer histories regardless of family history are provided below.

This observation is consistent with a  founder effect, wherein a
mutation identified in a contemporary population can be traced to a small group of
founders isolated by geographic, cultural, or other factors.  Most notably, two specific <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> mutations (185delAG and 5382insC) and a <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>

ethnic-specific alleles.  This greatly simplifies the technical aspects of
the test but is not without limitations.    For example, it is

None of the studies have had sufficient numbers of mutation-positive individuals to make definitive conclusions, and the findings are probably not sufficiently established to use in individual risk assessment and management. In 25
families with <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutations, an ovarian cancer cluster region was
identified in exon 11 bordered by nucleotides 3,035 and 6,629.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="206"/>  A study of 164 families with <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutations
collected by the Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium confirmed the initial
finding.  Mutations within the ovarian cancer cluster region were associated
with an increased risk of ovarian cancer and a decreased risk of breast cancer
in comparison with families with mutations on either side of this region.<Reference refidx="207"/>
In addition, a study of 356 families with protein-truncating <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> mutations collected by the Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium reported breast cancer risk to be lower with mutations in the central region (nucleotides 2,401–4,190) compared with surrounding regions.

However, in combination with other genetic loci and/or environmental factors, particularly given how common these can be, variants of this kind might significantly alter breast cancer risk.  These types of genetic variations are sometimes referred to as “polymorphisms,” meaning that the gene or locus occurs in several “forms” within the population (and more formally defined as polymorphic when a specific variation in a given locus occurs in more than 1% of the population).  Most loci that are polymorphic have no influence on disease risk or human traits (benign polymorphisms), while those that are associated with a difference in risk of disease or a human trait (however subtle) are sometimes termed “disease-associated polymorphisms” or “functionally relevant polymorphisms.”  This polygenic model of susceptibility is consistent with the observed patterns of familial aggregation of breast cancer.<Reference refidx="4"/> Although the clinical significance and causality of associations with breast cancer are often difficult to evaluate and establish, genetic polymorphisms may account for why some individuals are more sensitive than others to environmental carcinogens.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_1306">Polymorphisms underlying polygenic susceptibility to breast cancer are considered low penetrance, a term often applied to sequence variants associated with a minimal to moderate risk. This is in contrast to “high-penetrance” variants or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339337">alleles</GlossaryTermRef> that are typically associated with more severe <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460203">phenotypes</GlossaryTermRef>, for example those <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> mutations leading to an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339338">autosomal dominant</GlossaryTermRef> inheritance patterns in a family. The definition of a “moderate” risk of cancer is arbitrary, but it is usually considered to be in the range of a relative risk (RR) of 1.5 to 2.0. Because these types of sequence variants (also called low-penetrance genes, alleles, mutations, and polymorphisms) are relatively common in the general population, their contribution to cancer risk overall is estimated to be much greater than the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000485393">attributable risk</GlossaryTermRef> in the population from mutations in <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>. For example, it is estimated by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000712689">segregation analysis</GlossaryTermRef> that half of all breast cancer occurs in 12% of the population that is deemed most susceptible.<Reference refidx="3"/> There are no known low-penetrance variants in <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName>.

Both involve the epidemiologic case-control study design. The candidate gene approach involves selecting genes based on their known or presumed biological function,  relevance to carcinogenesis or organ physiology, and searching for or testing known genetic variants for an association with cancer risk.  This strategy relies on imperfect and incomplete biological knowledge, and, despite some confirmed associations (described below),  has been relatively disappointing.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/>  The candidate gene approach has largely been replaced by the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000636779">genome-wide association studies</GlossaryTermRef> (GWAS) in which a very large number of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000458046">single nucleotide polymorphisms</GlossaryTermRef>  (SNPs) (potentially 1 million or more) are chosen within the genome and tested, mostly without regard to their possible biological function, but instead to capture all genetic variation throughout the genome more uniformly.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1308"><Title>Breast Cancer Susceptibility Genes Identified Through Candidate Gene Approaches</Title><Para id="_1914">There is a very large literature of genetic epidemiology studies describing associations between various loci and breast cancer risk. Many of these studies suffer from significant design limitations. Perhaps as a consequence, most reported associations do not replicate in follow-up studies. This section is not a comprehensive review of all reported associations. This section describes associations that are believed by the editors to be clinically valid, in that they have been described in several studies or are supported by robust meta-analyses.

screening of women aged 50 to 59 years leads to a 25% to 30% reduction in
breast cancer mortality.  (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062751" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq">Breast Cancer Screening</SummaryRef> for more information.)  For women who begin mammographic screening at
age 40 to 49 years, a 17% reduction in breast cancer mortality is seen, which
occurs 15 years after the start of screening.<Reference refidx="10"/>  Observational data from a
cohort study of more than 28,000 women suggest that the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000322883">sensitivity</GlossaryTermRef> of
mammography is lower for young women.  In this study, the sensitivity was
lowest for younger women (aged 30–49 years) who had a first-degree relative
with breast cancer.  For these women, mammography detected 69% of breast
cancers diagnosed within 13 months of the first screening mammography.  By
contrast, sensitivity for women younger than 50 years without a family history
was 88% (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .08).  For women aged 50 years and older, sensitivity was 93% at 13 months
and did not vary by family history.<Reference refidx="11"/>  Preliminary data suggest that
mammography sensitivity is lower in <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> carriers than in 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000556483">noncarriers</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="8"/>  Subsequent observational studies have found that the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460206">positive predictive value</GlossaryTermRef> (PPV) of mammography increases with age and is highest among older
women and among women with a family history of breast cancer.<Reference refidx="12"/> Higher PPVs may be due to increased breast cancer incidence, higher

One study found an association between the presence of pushing margins and false-negative mammograms in 28 women, 26 of whom had a <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> mutation and two of whom had a <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutation.  Pushing margins, characteristic of medullary histology, are associated with an absence of fibrotic reaction.<Reference refidx="14"/> In addition, rapid tumor doubling times may lead to tumors presenting shortly after an apparently normal study. In one study, mean tumor doubling time in <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> carriers was 45 days, compared with 84 days in noncarriers.<Reference refidx="15"/> Another study that evaluated mammographic breast density in women with <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutations found no association between mutation status and mammographic density; however, in both carriers and noncarriers, increased breast density was associated with increased breast cancer risk.<Reference refidx="16"/></Para><Para id="_2134">The randomized Canadian National Breast Screening Study-2 compared
annual CBE plus mammography to CBE alone in women aged 50 to 59 years from the
general population.  Both groups were given instruction in BSE.<Reference refidx="17"/>  Although
mammography detected smaller primary invasive tumors, more invasive cancers, and more   DCIS than CBE, the breast cancer mortality rates
in the CBE-plus-mammography group and the CBE-alone group were nearly
identical, and compared favorably with other breast cancer screening trials. 
After a mean follow-up of 13 years (range 11.3–16.0 years), the cumulative
breast cancer mortality ratio was 1.02 (95% CI = 0.78–1.33).  One possible explanation of this finding was the careful training and
supervision of the health professionals performing CBE.
</Para><Para id="_2135">Digital mammography refers to the use of a digital detector to find and record x-ray images.  This technology improves contrast resolution <Reference refidx="18"/> and has been proposed as a potential strategy for improving the sensitivity of mammography.

Women exposed before age 30 years had an increased risk (HR, 1.90; 95%, CI 1.20–3.00), compared with those never exposed. This risk was primarily driven by nonmammographic radiation exposure in women younger than 20 years (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.02–2.58). </Para><Para id="_2552">With the routine use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutation carriers, any potential benefit of mammographic screening must be carefully weighed against potential risks, particularly in young women.<Reference refidx="28"/>  One study has suggested that the most cost-effective screening strategy in <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutation carriers may be annual MRI beginning at age 25 years, with alternating MRI and digital mammography (so that each test is done annually but screening occurs every 6 months) beginning at age 30 years.<Reference refidx="29"/> NCCN currently recommends annual MRI screening between ages 25 and 29 years and annual MRI and mammography between ages 30 and 75 years.<Reference refidx="30"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_2138"><Title>MRI</Title><Para id="_2139">Because of the relative insensitivity of mammography in women with an inherited risk of breast cancer, a number of screening modalities have been proposed and investigated in high-risk women, including <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation carriers. Many studies have described the experience with breast MRI screening in women at risk of breast cancer, including descriptions of relatively large multi-institutional trials.<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/><Reference refidx="35"/><Reference refidx="36"/><Reference refidx="37"/><Reference refidx="38"/><Reference refidx="39"/> </Para><Para id="_2141">Despite some limitations of these studies, they consistently demonstrate that breast MRI is more sensitive than either mammography or ultrasound for the detection of hereditary breast cancer. The results of six  large studies are presented in  <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062855#_2385" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-ovarian-genetics-pdq"> Table 9</SummaryRef>, Summary of  MRI Screening Studies in Women at Hereditary Risk of Breast Cancer.<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/><Reference refidx="37"/><Reference refidx="40"/><Reference refidx="41"/> Most cancers in these programs were screen detected, with only 6% of cancers presenting in the interval between screenings. The sensitivity of MRI (as defined by the study methodology) ranged from 71% to 100%. Of the combined studies, 77% of cancers were identified by MRI, and 42% were identified by mammography.

</Para><Para id="_2142">Concerns have been raised about the reduced specificity of MRI compared with other screening modalities. In one study, after the initial MRI screen, 16.5% of patients were recalled for further evaluation and an additional 7.6% of patients were recommended to undergo a short-interval follow-up examination at 6 months.<Reference refidx="34"/> These rates declined significantly during later screening rounds, with fewer than 10% of the subjects recalled for more detailed MRI and fewer than 3% recommended to have short interval follow-up. In a second study, Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Breast Screening (MARIBS), the recall rate for additional evaluation was 10.7% per year.<Reference refidx="33"/> The benign biopsy rates in the first study were 11% at first round, 6.6% at second round, and 4.7% at third round.<Reference refidx="34"/> In the MARIBS study, the aggregate surgical biopsy rate was 9 per 1,000 screening episodes, though this may underestimate the burden because follow-up ultrasounds, core-needle biopsies, and fine-needle aspirations have not been included in the numerator of the MARIBS calculation.<Reference refidx="33"/> The PPV of MRI has been calculated differently in the various series and fluctuates somewhat, depending on whether all abnormal examinations or only the examinations that result in a biopsy are counted in the denominator. Generally, the PPV of a recommendation for tissue sampling (as opposed to further investigation) is in the range of 50% in most series.


</Para><Para id="_2143">These trials appear to establish that MRI is superior to mammography in the detection of hereditary breast cancer, and that women participating in these trials including annual MRI screening were less likely to have a cancer missed by screening.<Reference refidx="42"/> However, mammography may identify some cancers, particularly DCIS, that are not identified by MRI.<Reference refidx="43"/> </Para><Para id="_2610">Regarding downstaging, one screening study demonstrated that patients at risk of hereditary breast cancer were more likely to be diagnosed with small tumors and node-negative disease than were women in two nonrandomized control groups.<Reference refidx="31"/> However, a randomized study of screening with or without MRI using tumor stage or mortality as an endpoint has not been performed. Despite the apparent sensitivity of MRI screening, some women in MRI-based programs will develop life-threatening breast cancer. In a prospective study of 51 <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and 41 <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutation carriers screened with yearly mammograms and MRIs (of whom 80 had prophylactic oophorectomy), 11 breast cancers (9 invasive and 2 DCIS) were detected. Six cancers were first detected on MRI; three were first detected by mammogram; and two were interval cancers. All breast cancers occurred in <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> mutation carriers, suggesting a continued high risk of <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>-related breast cancer after oophorectomy in the short term. These results suggest that surveillance and prevention strategies may have differing outcomes in <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutation carriers.<Reference refidx="38"/></Para><Para id="_2611">A publication combining results from three large studies (MARIBS, a Canadian study, and a Dutch MRI screening study) demonstrated that when MRI was added to mammography, 80% of cancers detected in <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutation carriers were either DCIS or invasive cancers smaller than 1 cm. In <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> mutation carriers, 49% of cancers were DCIS or small invasive cancers. In addition, the authors predicted mortality benefits with the addition of MRI for both <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutation carriers. The model predicted breast
cancer mortality reductions of 42% to 47% for mammography, 48% to 61% for MRI, and 50% to 62% for combined screening.<Reference refidx="44"/> An additional study examining <GeneName>BRCA1/2</GeneName> mutation carriers undergoing MRI between 1997 and 2006 has demonstrated that 97% of incident cancers were stage 0 or stage I.<Reference refidx="45"/> The American Cancer Society and NCCN have recommended the use of annual MRI screening for women at hereditary risk of breast cancer.<Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="46"/></Para><Para id="_2553">An additional question regarding the timing of mammography and MRI is whether they should be done simultaneously or in an alternating fashion (so that while each test is done annually, screening occurs every 6 months).

</Para><Para id="_2154">The effectiveness of risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM)  in women with <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> or <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutations has been evaluated in several studies. In one retrospective cohort study of 214 women considered to be at hereditary risk by virtue of a family history suggesting an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339338">autosomal dominant</GlossaryTermRef> predisposition, three women were diagnosed with breast cancer after bilateral RRM, with a median follow-up of 14 years.<Reference refidx="50"/> As 37.4 cancers were expected, the calculated risk reduction was 92% (95% CI, 76.6–98.3). In a follow-up subset analysis, 176 of the 214 high-risk women in this cohort study underwent <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460195">mutation analysis</GlossaryTermRef> of <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>. Mutations were found in 26 women (18 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000556486">deleterious</GlossaryTermRef>, eight VUS). None of those women had developed breast cancer after a median follow-up of 13.4 years.<Reference refidx="51"/> Two of the three women diagnosed with breast cancer after RRM were tested, and neither carried a mutation. The calculated risk reduction among mutation carriers was 89.5% to 100% (95% CI, 41.4%–100%), depending on the assumptions made about the expected numbers of cancers among mutation carriers and the status of the untested woman who developed cancer despite mastectomy. The result of this retrospective cohort study has been supported by a prospective analysis of 76 mutation carriers undergoing RRM and monitored prospectively for a mean of 2.9 years. No breast cancers were observed in these women, whereas eight were identified in women undergoing regular surveillance (HR for breast cancer after RRM, 0 [95% CI, 0–0.36]).<Reference refidx="52"/> </Para><Para id="_2155">The Prevention and Observation of Surgical Endpoints study group estimated the degree of breast cancer risk reduction after RRM in <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> mutation carriers. The rate of breast cancer in 105 mutation carriers who underwent bilateral RRM was compared with that in 378 mutation carriers who did not choose surgery. Bilateral mastectomy reduced the risk of breast cancer by approximately 90% after a mean follow-up of 6.4 years.<Reference refidx="53"/></Para><Para id="_2156">Another study evaluated the effectiveness of contralateral RRM in affected women with hereditary breast cancer. In a group of 148 <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> or <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutation carriers, 79 of whom underwent RRM, the risk of contralateral cancer was reduced by 91% and was independent of the effect of risk-reducing oophorectomy. Survival was better among women undergoing RRM, but this result was apparently associated with higher mortality due to the index cancer or metachronous ovarian cancer in the group not undergoing surgery.<Reference refidx="54"/> More recently, data from ten European centers on 550 women indicated that RRM was highly effective.<Reference refidx="55"/> Similarly, a retrospective study of 593 <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutation carriers included 105 women with unilateral breast cancer who underwent contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy and had a 10-year survival rate of 89%, compared with 71% in the group who did not undergo contralateral risk-reducing surgery (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001).<Reference refidx="56"/> However, these findings need to be confirmed in a larger series because of the potential presence of confounding factors (e.g., no information was provided regarding breast cancer screening practices, and there were missing grade and ER statuses for a large proportion of the sample).</Para><Para id="_2668">A retrospective study of 390 women with early-stage breast cancer who were from families with a known <GeneName>BRCA1/2</GeneName> mutation found a significant improvement in survival for women who underwent  bilateral mastectomy compared with those who chose unilateral mastectomy.<Reference refidx="57"/> A multivariate analysis controlling for age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, and treatment and other prognostic factors found that contralateral mastectomy was associated with a 48% reduction in death from breast cancer.  This was a relatively small study with a high potential for confounding of prognostic  factors.</Para><Para id="_2157">Studies describing histopathologic findings in RRM specimens from women with <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> or <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutations have been somewhat inconsistent. In two series, proliferative lesions associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (lobular carcinoma <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis>, atypical lobular hyperplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia, DCIS) were noted in 37% to 46% of women with mutations undergoing either unilateral or bilateral RRM.<Reference refidx="58"/><Reference refidx="59"/><Reference refidx="60"/>
 In these series, 13% to 15% of patients were found to have previously unsuspected DCIS in the prophylactically removed breast. Among 47 cases of risk-reducing bilateral or contralateral mastectomies performed in known <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> or <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutation carriers from Australia, three (6%) cancers were detected at surgery.<Reference refidx="61"/> In a study from Sweden among 100 women with a hereditary risk of breast cancer, unsuspected lesions were found in 13 out of 50 <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> mutation carriers.<Reference refidx="62"/> These findings were not replicated in a third retrospective cohort study. In this study, proliferative fibrocystic changes were noted in none of 11 bilateral mastectomies from patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000556486">deleterious mutations</GlossaryTermRef> and in only two of seven contralateral unilateral risk-reducing mastectomies in affected mutation carriers.<Reference refidx="63"/></Para><Para id="_2158">Although data are sparse, the evidence indicates that while a
substantial proportion of women with a strong family history of breast cancer
are interested in discussing RRM as a treatment option, uptake varies according to culture, geography, health care
system, insurance coverage, provider attitudes, and other social factors.  For
example, in one setting where the providers made one or  two field trips to family
gatherings for family information sessions and individual counseling, only 3%
of unaffected carriers obtained RRM within 1 year of
follow-up.<Reference refidx="64"/>  Among women at increased risk of breast cancer due to family
history, fewer than 10% opted for mastectomy.<Reference refidx="65"/>  Selection of this option was
related to breast cancer–related worry as opposed to objective risk parameters
(e.g., number of relatives with breast cancer).  In contrast, in a Dutch study of highly motivated women being followed up every 6 months at a high-risk center, more than half (51%) of unaffected carriers opted for RRM. Almost 90% of the RRM surgeries were performed within 1 year of DNA testing. In this study, those most likely to have RRM were women younger than 55 years and with children.<Reference refidx="66"/> In addition, self-perceived
risk has been closely linked to interest in RRM.<Reference refidx="65"/></Para><Para id="_2159">Assuming risk reduction in the range of 90%, a theoretical model suggests that for a group of 30-year-old women with <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> or <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutations, RRM would result in an average increased life expectancy of 2.9 to 5.3 years.<Reference refidx="67"/> While these data are useful for public policy decisions, they cannot be individualized for clinical care as they include assumptions that cannot be fully tested. Another study of at-risk women showed a 70% time-tradeoff value, indicating that the women were willing to sacrifice 30% of life expectancy in order to avoid RRM.<Reference refidx="68"/> A cost-effectiveness analysis study estimated that risk-reducing surgery (mastectomy and oophorectomy) is cost-effective compared with surveillance with regard to years of life saved, but not for improved quality of life.<Reference refidx="69"/></Para><Para id="_2325">A computer-simulated survival analysis using a Monte Carlo model included breast MRI, mammography, RRM, and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) and examined the impact of each of these separately on <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutation carriers.<Reference refidx="70"/> The most effective strategy was found to be RRSO at age 40 years and RRM at age 25 years, in which case survival at age 70 years approached that of the general population. However, delaying mastectomy until age 40 years, or substituting RRM with screening with breast MRI and mammogram, had little impact on survival estimates. For example, replacing RRM with MRI-based screening in women with RRSO at age 40 years led to a 3% to 5% decrement in survival compared with RRM at age 25 years.

There is a special sense of urgency for <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> mutation carriers, in whom cumulative lifetime risks of ovarian cancer may exceed 40%.</Para><Para id="_2204">Thus, it is expected that many new ovarian cancer biomarkers (either singly or in combination) will be proposed as ovarian cancer screening strategies during the next 5 to 10 years. While this is an active area of research with a number of promising new biomarkers in early development, <Strong> at present, none of these biomarkers alone or in combination have been sufficiently well studied to justify their routine clinical use for screening purposes</Strong>, either in the general population or in women at increased genetic risk.</Para><Para id="_2205">Before information related to emerging ovarian cancer biomarkers is addressed, it is important to consider the several steps that are required to develop and, more importantly, validate a new biomarker. One useful framework is that published by  the National Cancer Institute Early Detection Research Network investigators.<Reference refidx="141"/> They indicated that the goal of a cancer-screening program is to detect tumors at an early stage so that treatment is likely to be successful. The gold standard by which such programs are judged is whether the death rate from the cancer for which screening is performed is reduced among those being screened.  In addition, the screening test must be sufficiently noninvasive and inexpensive to allow widespread use in the population to be screened. Maintaining high test specificity (i.e., few false-positive results) is essential for a population screening test, because even a low false-positive rate results in many people having to undergo unnecessary and costly diagnostic procedures and psychological stress.  It is likely that the use of several such cancer biomarkers in combination will be required for a screening test to be both sensitive and specific.</Para><Para id="_2206">Furthermore, a clinically useful test must have a high PPV (a parameter derived from sensitivity, specificity, and disease prevalence in the screened population). Practically speaking, a biomarker with a PPV of  10% implies that ten surgical procedures would be required to identify one case of ovarian cancer; the remaining nine surgeries would represent false-positive test findings. In general, the ovarian cancer research community considers biomarkers with a PPV less than 10% to be clinically unacceptable, given the morbidity related to bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.  Finally, it is important to keep in mind that while novel biomarkers may be present in the sera of women with advanced ovarian cancer (who represent most  cases analyzed in the early phases of biomarker development), they may or may not be detectable in women with early-stage disease, which is essential if the screening test is to be clinically useful.</Para><Para id="_2207">It has been suggested that there are five general phases in biomarker development and validation:</Para><ItemizedList id="_2208" Style="bullet"><ListTitle>Phase I — Preclinical exploratory studies</ListTitle><ListItem>Identify potentially discriminating biomarkers.</ListItem><ListItem>Usually done by comparing gene over- or underexpression in the tumor compared with normal tissue.</ListItem><ListItem>Because many exploratory analyses in large numbers of genes are performed at this stage, one or more may seem to have good discriminating ability between cancers and normal tissue by random chance alone.</ListItem></ItemizedList><ItemizedList id="_2209" Style="bullet"><ListTitle>Phase 2 — Clinical assay development for clinical disease</ListTitle><ListItem>Develop a clinical assay that can be obtained on noninvasively obtained samples (e.g., a blood specimen).</ListItem><ListItem>Often the test targets the protein product of one of the genes found to be of interest in phase I.</ListItem><ListItem>The goal is to describe the performance characteristics of the assay for distinguishing between subjects with and without cancer.

High test specificity (i.e., a very low false-positive rate) is required to avoid unnecessary surgery and induction of premature menopause women with in false-positive results.

CA-125 values greater than 30 U/mL were considered abnormal. The symptom index independently predicted the presence of ovarian cancer, after controlling for CA-125 levels (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .05). The combination of an elevated CA-125 and a positive-symptom index correctly identified 89.3% of the cases. The symptom index correlated with the presence of cancer in 50% of the affected women who did not have elevated CA-125 levels, but 11.8% of the high-risk controls without cancer also had a positive-symptom index. The authors suggested that a composite index that included both CA-125 and the symptom index had better performance characteristics than either test used alone, and that this strategy might be used as a first screen in a multistep screening program.

This has been implemented in the form of the risk of ovarian cancer algorithm (ROCA), an investigational statistical model that incorporates serial CA-125 test results and other covariates into a computation that produces an estimate of the likelihood that ovarian cancer is present in the screened subject. The first report of this strategy, based on reanalysis of 5,550 average-risk women from the Stockholm Ovarian Cancer screening trial,  suggested that ovarian cancer cases and controls could be distinguished with 99.7% sensitivity, 83% specificity, and a PPV of 16%. That PPV represents an eightfold increase over the 2% PPV reported with a single measure of CA-125.<Reference refidx="145"/> This report was followed by applying the ROCA to 33,621 serial CA-125 values obtained from the 9,233 average-risk postmenopausal women in a prospective British ovarian cancer screening trial.<Reference refidx="146"/> The area under the receiver operator curve increased from 84% to 93% (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .01) for ROCA compared with a fixed CA-125 cutoff. These observations represented the first evidence that preclinical detection of ovarian cancer might be improved using this screening strategy. A prospective study of 13,000 normal volunteers aged 50 years and older in England used serial CA-125 values and the ROCA to stratify participants into low, intermediate, and elevated risk subgroups.<Reference refidx="147"/> Each had its own prescribed management strategy, including TVUS and repeat CA-125 either annually (low risk) or at 3 months (intermediate risk).

Neither cases nor controls in this study were well characterized regarding their familial and/or genetic risk status, but they have been suggested to comprise a high-risk population.

On that basis, the investigators have retracted their claim that this test is suitable for population screening.    If this test were used in patients at increased risk of ovarian cancer, the actual prevalence in such a target population is likely to be higher than that observed in the general population, but well below the assumed 50% figure used in the published analysis. This revised PPV of 6.5% indicates that approximately 1 in 15 women with a positive test would in fact have ovarian cancer, and only a fraction of those with ovarian cancer would be stages I or II.

Optimal timing of RRSO must be individualized, but evaluating a woman's risk of ovarian cancer based on mutation status can be helpful in the decision-making process.

There is concern that a small portion of the proximal fallopian tube remains when hysterectomy is not performed, thereby resulting in a residual increased risk of fallopian tube cancer. However, several studies that have examined fallopian tube cancers indicate that the vast majority of these cancers occur in the distal or midportion of the fallopian tube, suggesting that the occurrence of proximal fallopian tube cancer would be a very unlikely event. Some reports have suggested an increased incidence of uterine carcinoma in mutation carriers,<Reference refidx="189"/> whereas others have not confirmed an elevated risk of serous uterine cancer.<Reference refidx="190"/> A prospective study of 857 women suggested that any increased incidence of uterine cancer appeared to be among <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> mutation carriers  who used tamoxifen;<Reference refidx="191"/> this was confirmed by the same group in a later study of 4,456 <GeneName>BRCA1/2</GeneName> mutation carriers.<Reference refidx="192"/> Even with tamoxifen use, the excess risk of endometrial cancer was small, with a 10-year cumulative risk of 2%.<Reference refidx="192"/> In addition, the use of tamoxifen can now be minimized, given the options of raloxifene (which does not increase the risk of uterine cancer) and aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer prevention in postmenopausal women. Therefore, on the basis of the current understanding of the risk of uterine cancer in <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation carriers, there is not a singularly compelling reason to consider hysterectomy at the time of RRSO to reduce the risk of uterine cancer.  Concomitant hysterectomy does offer the advantage of simplifying the hormone replacement regimen for <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation carriers who choose to take hormones.  After hysterectomy, women can take estrogen alone (which does not increase the risk of breast cancer), without progestins, thereby eliminating the risk of postmenopausal bleeding.</Para><Para id="_2347">Studies indicate that removal of the uterus is not necessary as a risk-reducing procedure. No increased <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation prevalence was seen among 200 Jewish women with endometrial carcinoma or 56 unselected women with uterine papillary serous carcinoma.<Reference refidx="190"/><Reference refidx="193"/>    However, small studies have reported that uterine papillary serous carcinoma may be part of the <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName>-associated spectrum of disease.<Reference refidx="189"/><Reference refidx="194"/><Reference refidx="195"/>   The cumulative risk of endometrial cancer among <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation carriers with ER-positive breast cancer treated with tamoxifen may be an additional factor to consider when counseling this population about prophylactic hysterectomy.<Reference refidx="191"/><Reference refidx="196"/> Hysterectomy might also be considered in young, unaffected <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation carriers who may want to use HRT but for whom hysterectomy would offer a simplified regimen of estrogen alone. In counseling a <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation carrier about optimal risk-reducing surgical options, aggregate data suggest that the risk from residual tubal tissue after RRSO is the least compelling reason to suggest hysterectomy. Therefore, in the absence of tamoxifen use or other underlying uterine or cervical problems, hysterectomy is not a routine component of RRSO for <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> carriers.</Para><Para id="_2243">For women who are premenopausal at the time of surgery, the symptoms of surgical menopause (e.g., hot flashes, mood swings, weight gain, and genitourinary complaints) can cause a significant impairment in their quality of life.

Tamoxifen was associated with a nonsignificant risk reduction (RR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.3–1.8).

While PARP is involved in the repair of single-stranded breaks by base excision repair, <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> are active in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks by homologous combination. Therefore, it was hypothesized that inhibiting base excision repair with PARP inhibition in <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName>- or <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>-deficient tumors leads to enhanced cell death, as two separate repair mechanisms would be compromised—the concept of synthetic lethality. </Para><Para id="_2349">A phase I study of olaparib, an oral PARP inhibitor, demonstrated tolerability (with minimal side effects) and activity in <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutation carriers with ovarian, breast, and prostate cancers.<Reference refidx="270"/> A phase II trial of two different doses of olaparib demonstrated tolerability and efficacy in recurrent ovarian cancer patients with <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> or <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutations.<Reference refidx="272"/> The overall response rate was 33% (11 of 33 patients) in the cohort receiving 400 mg twice daily and 13% (3 of 24 patients) in the cohort receiving 100 mg twice daily.

In this series, OS was dominated by ovarian cancer-related deaths.  A similar study compared the risk of primary breast cancer in <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName>-related ovarian cancer patients and unaffected carriers.<Reference refidx="322"/>  The 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year risks of primary breast cancer were all statistically significantly lower in patients with ovarian cancer.  The risk of contralateral breast cancer among women with a unilateral breast cancer before their ovarian cancer diagnosis was also lower than in women without ovarian cancer, although the difference did not reach statistical significance.  These studies suggest that treatment for ovarian cancer, namely oophorectomy and platinum-based chemotherapy, may confer protection against subsequent breast cancer.  In a single-institution cohort study of 364 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer who underwent <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation testing, 135 (37.1%) were found to carry a germline <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> or <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutation.

Studies that required an immediate decision to test, rather than allowing delayed decision making, tended to report higher uptake rates.<Reference refidx="1"/>  However, there is evidence that women diagnosed with breast cancer are equally satisfied with genetic counseling (including information received and strength and timing of physician recommendations for counseling), whether they received genetic counseling before or after their definitive surgery for breast cancer.<Reference refidx="12"/>   Another review <Reference refidx="13"/> found that uptake of genetic testing for  <GeneName>BRCA1/2</GeneName> mutations was related to psychological factors (e.g., anxiety about breast cancer  and perceived risk of breast cancer) and demographic and medical factors (e.g., history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer, presence of children, and higher number of affected first-degree relatives).  Family members with a known <GeneName>BRCA1/2</GeneName> mutation were more likely to pursue testing; those with more extensive knowledge of <GeneName>BRCA1/2</GeneName> testing, heightened risk perceptions, beliefs that mammography would promote health benefit, and high intentions to undergo testing were more likely to follow through with testing.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para><Para id="_1585">In a review of racial/ethnic differences that affect uptake of <GeneName>BRCA1/2</GeneName> testing, intention to undergo genetic testing in African American women was related to having at least one first-degree relative with breast cancer or ovarian cancer, higher perceived risk of being a carrier, and less anticipatory guilt about the possibility of being a gene carrier.<Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Para id="_1586">  Reasons cited for following through with testing included a desire  to learn about a child's risk, to feel relief from uncertainty, to inform screening or prophylactic surgery decisions, and to inform important life decisions such as marriage and childbearing.<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="16"/> Among African American women, the most important reason for testing included motivation to help other relatives decide on genetic testing.<Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Para id="_2469">Physician recommendation may be another motivator for testing.

Overall, more consistent policies were available for private than for public payers, indicating better communication of eligibility criteria and transparency of coverage.  However, across all types of coverage, including private coverage, the criteria were inconsistent for coverage of genetic counseling services.

In addition, female carriers who were the first in their families to be tested or whose siblings were all negative had significantly higher distress than other female carriers.<Reference refidx="89"/> Another study found that spousal anxiety about genetic testing and supportiveness differentiated the impact of <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> test results. When the spouse was highly anxious and unsupportive in style, the mutation carrier had significantly higher levels of distress. These studies illustrate that genetic test results are not received in a vacuum, and that researchers need to consider the context of the tested individual in determining which individuals applying for genetic testing may require additional emotional support.<Reference refidx="90"/>  </Para><Para id="_300">In another study, depression rates postdisclosure were unchanged for mutation
carriers and markedly decreased for noncarriers.<Reference refidx="36"/>  An analysis of the
distress of individuals receiving <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> results in the context of their siblings'
results, however, revealed patterns of response suggesting that certain
subgroups of tested individuals have markedly increased levels of distress
after disclosure that were not apparent when the analysis focused only on
comparing the mean scores for carriers versus noncarriers.<Reference refidx="89"/>  Early
optimistic findings may not sufficiently reflect the true complexity of
response to disclosure of <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> test results.  Female carriers who had no
carrier siblings had distress scores (IES) similar to those found in cancer
patients 10 weeks after their diagnosis.  The distress of male subjects was
highly correlated with the status of their siblings’ test results or lack
thereof.<Reference refidx="89"/>  One pilot study suggested that women diagnosed more recently were
more distressed after counseling.<Reference refidx="121"/>  A survey of women enrolled in a high-risk clinic found that heightened levels of distress may be more related to living with the awareness of a familial risk of cancer than with the genetic testing process itself.  Obtaining genetic testing may be less stressful than living with the awareness of familial risk of cancer.<Reference refidx="122"/> (Refer to the PDQ Supportive Care summaries on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062739" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/depression-hp-pdq">Depression</SummaryRef> and <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062891" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/anxiety-distress-hp-pdq">Adjustment to Cancer: Anxiety and Distress</SummaryRef> for more detailed information about depression and anxiety associated with a cancer diagnosis.)

Women mutation carriers who have had breast cancer worried more than unaffected women about developing ovarian cancer, though, in general, worry about ovarian cancer risk was found to be unrealistically low.<Reference refidx="126"/> In addition, some distress related to the burden of conveying genetic information to relatives has been noted among those who are the first in their families to be tested.<Reference refidx="125"/><Reference refidx="128"/></Para><Para id="_1935">The long-term effect of uninformative <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> test results (<GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> negative, negative on a panel of three Ashkenazi founder mutations, or detecting a variant of uncertain significance) was examined in 209 women recruited from one of two comprehensive cancer centers or a community hospital.<Reference refidx="129"/>  These women had a personal history of breast or ovarian cancer and were assessed at pretesting, 1-,  6-, and 12-months postdisclosure.  Distress was low at each time point, and declined from pretest to post-disclosure, remaining stable and low thereafter.  No clinical cut-offs were reported. Those who reported higher general distress associated with cancer risk, risk-reduction efforts, and family communication and lower confidence in dealing with these issues, and those who expected to carry a deleterious mutation, had greater decisional conflict related to managing their cancer risk through 1-year posttest. In another study of 182 women drawn from this sample, most (84%) had made a risk management decision within 6 months of test result disclosure.  Those who were delayed in making a risk management decision reported greater feelings of decisional uncertainty, dissatisfaction, and lack of confidence, yet there was also a high level of reported decisional conflict even among those who were early or intermediate decision-makers. Increased depression levels postdisclosure predicted increased risk of delay in risk management decision-making.<Reference refidx="130"/></Para><Para id="_630">Several studies have compared the provision of breast cancer genetics services by different providers and the psychological impact on women at high and low risk of cancer. In a study of 735 women at all hereditary breast/ovarian cancer risk levels, the services of a multidisciplinary team of genetics specialists was compared with services provided by surgeons. There were no significant differences between groups in anxiety, cancer worry, or perceived risk.<Reference refidx="131"/> In a Scottish study of 373 participants, an alternative model of cancer genetics services using genetics nurse specialists in community-based services was compared with standard genetics regional services. There was no difference in cancer worry or change in health behaviors between the two groups. Cancer worry decreased for both groups over a 6-month period. Women who dropped out of the study tended to be in the nurse provider arm or were at low risk of breast cancer.<Reference refidx="132"/> In a small U.S. study, an evaluation of nurses and genetic counselors as providers of education about breast cancer susceptibility testing was conducted to compare outcomes of pretest education about breast cancer susceptibility. Four genetic counselors and two nurses completed specialized training in cancer genetics. Women receiving pretest education from nurses were as satisfied with information received and had equal degrees of perceived autonomy and partnership. The study findings suggest that with proper training and supervision, both genetic counselors and nurses can be effective in providing pretest education to women considering genetic susceptibility testing for breast cancer risk.<Reference refidx="133"/></Para><Para id="_301">There has been little empirical research in the communication of risk

At 1 week and 6 months follow-up, the decision aid had no effect on informed choice, decisional regret, or actual genetic testing decision.  However, women who received the decision aid had significantly higher knowledge levels and felt more informed about genetic testing than women who received the control pamphlet. The decision aid also helped those women who did not have their blood drawn for genetic testing at the first visit to clarify their values about their testing decision.<Reference refidx="137"/> </Para><Para id="_302">Preferences for delivery of breast cancer genetic testing are reported in one

gynecologist (5%).  Patients in that study preferred results disclosure by an
oncologist.  Younger women especially expressed a need for individual
consideration of their personal values and goals or potential emotional
reactions to testing; 67% believed emotional support and counseling were a
necessary part of posttest counseling.  Most women (82%) wanted to
be able to self-refer for genetic testing, without a physician referral.

specifically about the results of <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> genetic testing, is complex; there are
few systematic data available on this topic.  Gender appears to be an important variable in family communication and psychological outcomes.  One
study documented that female carriers are more likely to disclose their status
to other family members (especially sisters and children aged 14–18 years) than
are male carriers.<Reference refidx="138"/>  Among males, noncarriers were more likely than carriers
to tell their sisters and children the results of their tests.  <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName>
carriers who disclosed their results to sisters had a slight decrease in
psychological distress, compared with a slight increase in distress for carriers
who chose not to tell their sisters.  One study found that men reported greater difficulty disclosing mutation-positive results to family members than  women (90% vs. 70%).<Reference refidx="139"/></Para><Para id="_935">Family communication of <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> test results to relatives is another factor affecting participation in testing. There have been more studies of communication with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460150">first-degree relatives</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000485395">second-degree relatives</GlossaryTermRef> than with more distant family members. One study investigated the process and content of communication among sisters about <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> test results.<Reference refidx="140"/> Study results suggest that both mutation carriers and women with uninformative results communicate with sisters to provide them with genetic risk information. Among relatives with whom genetic test results were not discussed, the most important reason given was that the affected women were not close to their relatives. Studies found that women with a <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation more often shared their results with their mother and adult sisters and daughters than with their father and adult brothers and sons.<Reference refidx="68"/><Reference refidx="141"/><Reference refidx="142"/><Reference refidx="143"/><Reference refidx="144"/> A study that evaluated communication of test results to first-degree relatives at 4 months postdisclosure found that women aged 40 years or older were more likely to inform their parents of test results compared with younger women. Participants also were more likely to inform brothers of their results if the <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation was inherited through the paternal line.<Reference refidx="142"/> Another study found that disclosure was limited mainly to first-degree relatives, and dissemination of information to distant relatives was problematic.<Reference refidx="145"/> Age was a significant factor in informing distant relatives with younger patients being more willing to communicate their genetic test result.<Reference refidx="140"/><Reference refidx="141"/><Reference refidx="145"/> </Para><Para id="_790">A few in-depth qualitative studies have looked at issues associated with family communication about genetic testing. Although the findings from these studies may not be generalizable to the larger population of at-risk persons, they illustrate the complexity of issues involved in conveying hereditary cancer risk information in families.<Reference refidx="146"/>  On the basis of 15 interviews conducted with women attending a familial cancer genetics clinic, the authors concluded that while women felt a sense of duty to discuss genetic testing with their relatives, they also experienced conflicting feelings of uncertainty, respect, and isolation.  Decisions about whom in the family to inform and how to inform them about hereditary cancer and genetic testing may be influenced by tensions between women's need to fulfill social roles and their responsibilities toward themselves and others.<Reference refidx="146"/> Another qualitative study of 21 women who attended a familial breast and ovarian cancer genetics clinic suggested that some women may find it difficult to communicate about inherited cancer risk with their partners and with certain relatives, especially brothers, because of those persons’ own fears and worries about cancer.<Reference refidx="144"/>  This study also suggested that how genetic risk information is shared within families may depend on the existing norms for communicating about cancer in general.  For example, family members may be generally open to sharing information about cancer with each other, may selectively avoid discussing cancer information with certain family members to protect themselves or other relatives from negative emotional reactions, or may ask a specific relative to act as an intermediary to  disclosure of information to other family members.<Reference refidx="147"/>  The potential importance of persons outside the family, such as friends, as both confidantes about inherited cancer risk information and as sources of support for coping with this information was also noted in the study.<Reference refidx="144"/> </Para><Para id="_1403">A study of 31 mothers with a documented <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation explored patterns of dissemination to children.<Reference refidx="148"/> Of those who chose to disclose test results to their children, age of offspring was the most important factor.

More than 70% of mothers informed their children within a week of learning their test result. Ninety-three percent of mothers who chose not to share their results with their children indicated that it was because their children were too young.

posttesting.<Reference refidx="151"/> The study found that most couples discussed the decision to undergo testing (98%), most test participants felt their partners were supportive, and most women disclosed test results to their partners (97%, n = 148). Test participants who felt their partners were supportive during pretest discussions experienced less distress after disclosure, and 
partners who felt more comfortable sharing concerns with test participants pretest experienced less distress after disclosure. Six-month follow-up revealed that 22% of participants felt the need to talk about the testing experience with their partners in the week before the interview. Most participants (72%, n = 107) reported comfort in sharing concerns with their partners, and 5% (n = 7) reported relationship strain as a result of genetic testing.

These men reported little communication with relatives about the illness, with some men reporting being excluded from discussion about cancer 
among female family members.  Some men in the study also reported actively avoiding open discussion with daughters and other relatives.<Reference refidx="152"/> In contrast, a study of 59 men testing positive for a <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> mutation found that most men participated in family discussions about breast and/or ovarian cancer. However, fewer than half of the men participated in family discussions about risk-reducing surgery. The main reason given for having <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> testing was concern for their children and a need for certainty about whether they could have transmitted the mutation to their children.

Men with a high monitoring coping style and greater perceived breast cancer risk for their wives reported higher levels of distress. Open communication between the men and their partners and the occurrence of a cancer-related event in the wife’s family in the last year were associated with lower distress levels.

Attitudinal predictors of interest in PGD included agreement that others at risk of HBOC should be offered PGD; the belief that PGD is acceptable for persons at risk of HBOC; the belief that PGD information should be given to individuals at risk of HBOC; and endorsement of PGD benefits of having children without genetic mutations and eliminating genetic diseases.</Para><Para id="_1972">Conversely, those who indicated that PGD was “too much like playing God” and reported that they considered PGD in the context of religion, had less interest in PGD.</Para><Para id="_1348">The U.K. Human Fertilization and Embryology authority has approved the use of PGD for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. In a sample of 102 women with a <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation, most were supportive of PGD but only 38% of the women who had completed  their families would consider it for themselves had PGD been available, and only 14% of women who were contemplating a future pregnancy would consider PGD.<Reference refidx="178"/> In a study of 77 individuals undergoing <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> testing as part of a multicenter cohort study in Spain, 61% of respondents reported they would consider PGD. Factors associated with PGD interest were age 40 years and older  and had a prior cancer diagnosis.<Reference refidx="179"/> </Para><Para id="_2501">In France, couples who obtain authorization from a multidisciplinary prenatal diagnosis team may access PGD free of charge as a benefit of their national 
health care system. However, no <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> carriers have been authorized to use PGD. In a national study of 490 unaffected <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation carriers of childbearing age (women aged 18–49 years; men aged 18–69 years), 16% stated that <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> test results had altered their ongoing plans for childbearing.<Reference refidx="180"/> Upon qualitative analysis of written comments provided by some respondents, 
the primary impact was related to accelerating the timing of pregnancy, feelings of guilt about possibly passing on the mutation to offspring, and having future children. In response to a 
hypothetical scenario in which PGD was readily available, 33% of participants reported that they would undergo PGD. Factors associated with this intention were having no future reproductive plans at the time of the survey, feeling pregnancy termination was an acceptable option in the context of identifying a <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation, and having fewer cases of breast and/or ovarian cancer in the family. When presented with questions about expectations about delivery of PGD or prenatal diagnosis (PND) information, 85% of respondents felt it should be provided along with <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> test results; 45% felt that it should be provided when carriers decide to have children. Respondents stated 
that they would expect this information to be delivered by cancer geneticists (92%), obstetrician/gynecologists (76%), and general practitioners (48%).</Para><Para id="_2374">A small (N = 25) qualitative study of <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation–positive women of reproductive age who underwent genetic testing before having children evaluated how their <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> status influenced their attitudes about reproductive genetic testing (both PGD and PND) and decisions about having children.<Reference refidx="181"/> In this study, the decision to undergo <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> testing was primarily motivated by the desire to manage one’s personal cancer risk, rather than a desire to inform future reproductive decisions. The perceived severity of HBOC influenced concerns about passing on a <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation to children and also influenced willingness to consider PGD or PND and varied based on personal experience. Most did not believe that <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation–positive status was a reason to terminate a pregnancy. As observed in prior studies, knowledge of reproductive options varied; however, there was a tendency among participants to view PGD as more acceptable than PND with regard to termination of 
pregnancy. Decisions regarding the pros and cons of PGD versus PND with termination of pregnancy were driven primarily by personal preferences and experiences, rather than by morality judgments. For example, women were deterred from PGD based on the need to undergo <Emphasis>in vitro</Emphasis> fertilization and to take hormones that might increase cancer risk and based on the observed 
experiences of others who underwent this procedure.</Para><Para id="_2326">One study has examined these issues among high-risk men recruited from FORCE and Craigslist (a bulletin board Web site) (N = 228).<Reference refidx="182"/> Similar to the previous studies of women, only 20% of men were aware of PGD before survey participation. In a multivariate analysis, those who selected the “other” option for possible benefits of PGD compared with those who selected from several predetermined options (e.g., having children without genetic mutations) and those who considered PGD in the context of 
religion (as opposed to health and safety) were less likely to report that they would ever consider using PGD.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_308"><Title>Cultural/Community Effects</Title><Para id="_309">The recognition that <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> mutations are prevalent, not only in

</Para><Para id="_312">Studies have shown that 62% of studied family members were aware of the family
history and that 88% of hereditary breast/ovarian cancer family members
surveyed have significant concerns about privacy and confidentiality. 
Expressed concern about cancer in third-degree relatives, or relatives farther

Attitudes toward testing varied by ethnicity, previous exposure to genetic
information, age, optimism, and information style.  Altruism is a factor
motivating genetic testing in some people.<Reference refidx="195"/>  Many

Patients and health care providers would benefit from enhanced consideration of the ethical issues of warning family members about hereditary cancer risk.

Use of the decision aid did not alter cancer risk management intentions and behaviors. Slightly detrimental effects on well-being and several decision-related outcomes, however, were noted among affected women.<Reference refidx="204"/>
Another study compared responses to a tailored decision aid (including a values-clarification exercise) versus a general information pamphlet intended for women making decisions about ovarian cancer risk management.  In the short term, the women receiving the tailored decision aid showed a decrease in decisional conflict and increased knowledge compared with women receiving the pamphlet, but no differences in decisional outcomes were found between the two groups.  In addition, the decision aid did not appear to alter the participant’s baseline cancer risk management decisions.<Reference refidx="203"/> A third decision aid focused on breast cancer risk management decision support for women with a <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> mutation.  Pre-evaluations and postevaluations of the decision aid in 20 women showed that use of the aid resulted in a significant decrease in decisional conflict, improvement in knowledge, and a decrease in uncertainty about tamoxifen use, RRM and RRSO.

Findings from these studies are reported in  <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062855#_2613" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-ovarian-genetics-pdq">Table 13</SummaryRef> and <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062855#_2614" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-ovarian-genetics-pdq">Table 14</SummaryRef>.  Outcomes vary across studies and include uptake or adherence to screening (mammography, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], cancer antigen [CA] 125, transvaginal ultrasound [TVUS]) and  selection of RRM and RRSO. Studies generally report outcomes by mutation carrier or testing status (e.g., mutation-positive, mutation-negative, or declined genetic testing).  Follow-up time after notification of genetic risk status also varied across studies, ranging from 12 months up to several years.</Para><Para id="_1522">Findings from these studies suggest that breast screening often improves after notification of <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> mutation carrier status; nonetheless, screening remains suboptimal.  Fewer studies have examined adoption of MRI as a screening modality, probably due to the recent availability of efficacy data.  Screening for ovarian cancer varied widely across studies, and also varied based on type of screening test (i.e., CA-125 serum testing vs. TVUS screening).  However, ovarian cancer screening does not appear to be widely adopted by <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> mutation carriers.  Uptake of RRM varied widely across studies, and may be influenced by personal factors (such as younger age or having a family history of breast cancer), psychosocial factors (such as a desire for reduction of cancer-related distress), recommendations of the health care provider, and cultural or health care system factors. An individual’s choice to have a bilateral mastectomy also appears to be influenced by pretreatment genetic education and counseling regardless of the genetic test results.<Reference refidx="206"/> Similarly, uptake of RRSO also varied across studies, and may be influenced by similar factors, including older age, personal history of breast cancer, perceived risk of ovarian cancer, cultural factors (i.e., country), and the recommendations of the health care provider.</Para><Table id="_2613"><Title>Table 13.

In one study of a number of unaffected women with no previous risk-reducing surgery who received results of <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> testing after genetic counseling, 17% of carriers (2 of 12) intended to have mastectomies and 33% (4 of 12) intended to have oophorectomies.<Reference refidx="106"/> In a later study of the same population, RRM was considered an important option by 35% of women who tested positive, whereas risk-reducing oophorectomy was considered an important option by 76%. A prospective study assessed the stability of risk management preferences over five time points (pre-<GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> testing to 9 months after results disclosure) among 80 Dutch women with a documented <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation. Forty-six participants indicated a preference for screening at baseline. Of 25 women who preferred RRM at baseline, 22 indicated the same preference 9 months after test results disclosure; however, it was not reported how many women actually had RRM.<Reference refidx="222"/></Para><Para id="_1590">  Initial interest does not always translate into the decision for surgery.  Two different studies found low rates of RRM among mutation carriers in the year after result disclosure, one showing 3% (1 of 29) of carriers and the other 9% (3 of 34) of carriers having had this surgery.<Reference refidx="160"/><Reference refidx="223"/> Among members from a large <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> kindred, utilization of cancer 
screening and/or risk-reducing surgeries was assessed at baseline (before disclosure of results), and at 1 year and 2 years after disclosure of  <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> test results. Of the 269 men and women who participated, complete data were obtained on 37 female carriers and 92 female 
noncarriers, all aged 25 years or older. At 2 years after disclosure of test results, none of the women had undergone RRM, although 4 of the 37 carriers (10.8%) said they were considering the procedure. In contrast, of the 26 women who had not had an oophorectomy before baseline, 46% (12 of 26) had obtained an oophorectomy by 2 years after testing. Of those carriers aged 25 to 39 years, 29% (5 of 17) underwent oophorectomy, while 78% (7 of 9) of the carriers aged 40 years and older had this procedure.<Reference refidx="207"/> In a study assessing uptake of risk-reducing surgery 3 months after <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> result disclosure, 7 of 62 women had undergone RRM and 13 of 62 women had undergone RRSO. Intent to undergo RRSO before testing correlated with procedure uptake.  In contrast, intent to undergo RRM did not correlate with uptake. Overall, reasons given for indecision about risk-reducing surgery included complex testing factors such as the significance of family history in the absence of a mutation, concerns over the surgical procedure, and  time and uncertainty regarding early menopause and the use of HRT.<Reference refidx="224"/>  In a UK study, data were collected during observations of genetic consultations and in semistructured interviews with 41 women after they received genetic counseling.<Reference refidx="225"/> The option of risk-reducing surgery was raised in 29 consultations and discussed in 35 of the postclinic interviews.  Fifteen women said they would consider having an oophorectomy in the future, and nine said they would consider having a mastectomy.  The implications of undergoing oophorectomy and mastectomy were discussed in postclinic interviews.  Risk-reducing surgery was described by the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460230">counselees</GlossaryTermRef> as providing individuals with a means to (a) fulfill their obligations to other family members and (b) reduce risk and contain their fear of cancer.

A study that evaluated predictors of contralateral  RRM among 435 breast cancer survivors found that 16% had undergone contralateral  RRM (in conjunction with mastectomy of the affected breast) before referral for genetic counseling and <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> genetic testing.<Reference refidx="229"/> Predictors of contralateral  RRM before genetic counseling and testing included younger age at breast cancer diagnosis, more time since diagnosis, having at least one affected first-degree relative, and not being employed full-time.  In the year after disclosure of test results, 18% of women who tested positive for a <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> mutation and 2% of those whose test results were uninformative underwent contralateral  RRM.  Predictors of contralateral  RRM after genetic testing included younger age at breast cancer diagnosis, higher cancer-specific distress before genetic counseling, and having a positive <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> test result.  In this study, contralateral  RRM was not associated with distress at 1 year after disclosure of genetic test results.  A retrospective chart review evaluated uptake of bilateral mastectomies in 110 women who underwent <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> genetic testing before making surgical decisions about the treatment of newly diagnosed breast cancer.  <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation carriers were more likely to undergo bilateral mastectomies than were women in whom no mutation was detected (83% vs. 37%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .046).<Reference refidx="230"/>  The only predictor of contralateral RRM in women without a mutation was being married (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .03).

Twenty-nine percent reported altered feelings of femininity after the procedure, 44% reported adverse changes in their sexual relationships, and 35% indicated that they believed their partners experienced adverse changes in their sexual relationship.  Ten percent of women, however, reported positive changes in their sexual relationship after the procedure. Compared with patients who indicated satisfaction with this procedure, nonsatisfied patients were more likely to feel less informed about the procedure and its consequences, report more complications and physical complaints, feel that their breasts did not belong to their body, and indicate that they would not opt for reconstruction again.

These women, however, did not show a statistically significant increase in cancer worry or negative psychological consequences as a result of these findings.  The 1,174 women who had no mammographic abnormality detected experienced a decrease in cancer worry and a decrease in negative psychological consequences compared with baseline after receipt of their results.

Overall, however, anxiety declined in women undergoing prophylactic mastectomy; at 1 year, their anxiety scores were closer to those of women choosing surveillance and to the scores of non–mutation carriers.<Reference refidx="243"/> Interestingly, women opting for prophylactic mastectomy had lower pretest satisfaction with their breasts and general body image than carriers who opted for surveillance or noncarriers of <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> mutations. Of the women who had a prophylactic mastectomy, all but one did not regret the decision at 1 year posttest disclosure, but many had difficulties with body image, sexual interest and functioning, and self-esteem. The perception that doctors had inadequately informed them about the consequences of prophylactic mastectomy was associated with regret.<Reference refidx="243"/> At 5-year follow-up, women who had undergone RRM had less favorable body image and changes in sexual relationships, but also had a significant reduction in the fear of developing cancer.<Reference refidx="114"/> In a study of 78 women who underwent risk-reducing surgery (including <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> carriers and women who were from high-risk families with no detectable <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> mutation), cancer-specific and general distress were assessed 2 weeks before surgery and at 6 and 12 months postsurgery.<Reference refidx="244"/>  The sample included women who had RRM and RRSO alone and women who had both surgeries.

Seventy percent were satisfied with prophylactic mastectomy, 11% were neutral, and 19% were dissatisfied.  Eighteen percent believed that if they had the choice to make again, they probably or definitely would not have a prophylactic mastectomy.  About three quarters said their worry about cancer was diminished by surgery.  One-half reported no change in their satisfaction with body image; 16% reported improved body image after surgery.  Thirty-six percent said they were dissatisfied with their body image after prophylactic mastectomy.  About one-quarter of the women reported adverse impact of prophylactic mastectomy on their sexual relationships and sense of femininity, and 18% had diminished self-esteem.  Factors most strongly associated with satisfaction with prophylactic mastectomy were postsurgical satisfaction with appearance, reduced stress, no reconstruction or lack of problems with implants, and no change or improvement in sexual relationships.  Women who cited physician advice as the primary reason for choosing prophylactic mastectomy tended to be dissatisfied after prophylactic mastectomy.<Reference refidx="245"/></Para><Para id="_1022">A study of 60 healthy women who underwent RRM measured levels of satisfaction, body image, sexual functioning, intrusion and avoidance, and current psychological status at a mean of 4 years and 4 months postsurgery.

Overall, 97% of the women surveyed were either satisfied (17%) or extremely satisfied (80%) with their decision to have RRM, and all but one participant would recommend this procedure to other women. Most women (66.7%) reported that surgery had no impact on their sexual life, although 31.7% reported a worsening sexual life, and 76.6% reported either no change in body image or an improvement in body image, regardless of whether reconstruction was performed. Worsening self-image was reported by 23.3% of women after surgery. Women’s mean distress levels after surgery were only slightly above normal levels, although those women who continued to perceive their postsurgery breast cancer risk as high had higher mean levels of global and cancer-related distress than those who perceived their risk as low. Additionally, <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutation carriers and women with a strong family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer had higher mean levels of cancer-related distress than women with a limited family history.<Reference refidx="246"/></Para><Para id="_793">Very little is known about how the results of genetic testing affect treatment decisions at the time of cancer diagnosis.

Another subset of women undergoing radiation therapy was not approached for counseling (n = 182) but  was followed using the same measures. Psychological distress was measured at baseline and at 4, 11, 27, and 43 weeks after initial consultation for radiation therapy.

Overall, 83% of all participants stated they were satisfied or very satisfied, 8% were neutral, and 9% were dissatisfied with contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. Most women also reported favorable effects or no change in their self-esteem, level of stress, and emotional stability after surgery (88%, 83%, and 88%, respectively). Despite the high levels of overall satisfaction, 33% reported negative body image, 26% reported a reduced sense of femininity, and 23% reported a negative effect on sexual relationships. The type of surgical procedure also affected levels of satisfaction. The authors attributed this difference to the high rate of unanticipated reoperations in the group of women having subcutaneous mastectomy (43%) versus the group having simple mastectomy (15%) (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .0001).

Comparison of this group to normative samples on quality-of-life indicators (Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire [SF-36]; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire scores) indicated no reductions in quality of life in these women.</Para><Para id="_1399">A qualitative study examining material on the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.facingourrisk.org/">FORCE</ExternalRef> Web site posted by 21 high-risk women (<GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> positive) undergoing RRM showed that these women anticipated and received negative reactions from friends and family regarding the surgery, and that they managed disclosure in ways to maintain emotional support and self-protection for their decision. Many of the women expressed a relief from intrusive breast cancer thoughts and worry, and were satisfied with the cosmetic result of their surgery.<Reference refidx="253"/></Para><Para id="_1400">In contrast, another study examined long-term psychosocial outcomes in 684 women who had had bilateral or contralateral RRM on average 9 years before assessment.<Reference refidx="254"/> A majority of women (59%) also had reconstructive surgery.  Interestingly, based on a Likert scale, 85% of women reported that they were satisfied or very satisfied with their decision to have an RRM. However, in qualitative interviews, a large number of women went on to describe dissatisfaction or negative psychosocial outcomes associated with surgery. The authors coded the responses as negative when women reported still being anxious about their breast cancer risk and/or reported negative feelings about their body image, pain, and sexuality. Seventy-nine percent of the women providing negative comments and 84% of those making mixed comments (mixture of satisfaction and dissatisfaction) responded that they were either satisfied or very satisfied with their decision. Twice as many women with bilateral mastectomy made negative and mixed comments than did women with contralateral mastectomy. The areas of most concern were body image, problems with breast implants, pain after surgery, and sexuality. The authors proposed that those who had undergone contralateral procedures had already been treated for cancer, while those who had undergone bilateral procedures had not been treated previously, and this may partially account for the differences in satisfaction between the two groups. These findings suggest that women's satisfaction with RRM may be tempered by their complex reactions over time. </Para><Para id="_1592">In a qualitative study of 108 women who underwent or were considering RRM, more than half of those <Emphasis>who had RRM</Emphasis> felt that presurgical consultation with a psychologist was advisable; nearly two-thirds thought that postsurgical consultation was also appropriate. All of the women <Emphasis>who were considering RRM</Emphasis> believed that psychological consultation before surgery would facilitate decision-making.<Reference refidx="255"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1402"><Title>Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy</Title><Para id="_937">A retrospective self-administered survey of 40 women aged 35 to 74 years at time of RRSO (57.5% were younger than 50 years), who had undergone the procedure through the Ontario Ministry of Health due to a family history of ovarian cancer, found that RRSO resulted in a significant reduction in perceived ovarian cancer risk.  Fifty-seven percent identified a 
decrease in perceived risk as a benefit of RRSO (35% did not comment on RRSO benefits) and 49% reported that they would repeat RRSO to decrease cancer risk.  The overall quality-of-life scores were consistent with those published for women who are menopausal or participating in hormone studies.<Reference refidx="256"/> Quality of life in 59 women who underwent RRSO was assessed at 24 months postprocedure.<Reference refidx="257"/> Overall quality of life was similar to the general population and breast cancer survivors, with approximately 20% reporting depression. The 30% of subjects reporting vaginal dryness and dyspareunia were more likely to report dissatisfaction with the procedure. </Para><Para id="_2419">A Canadian prospective study examined the impact of RRSO on menopausal symptoms and sexual functioning before surgery and then 1 year later in a sample of 114 women with known <GeneName>BRCA1/2</GeneName> mutations.<Reference refidx="258"/>  Satisfaction with the decision to undergo RRSO was high regardless of symptoms reported.  Those who were premenopausal at the time of surgery (n = 75) experienced a worsening of symptoms and a decline in sexual functioning.  HRT addressed vaginal dryness and dyspareunia but not declines in sexual pleasure.  HRT also resulted in fewer moderate to severe hot flashes.   </Para><Para id="_1625">Additional work reported by this group found that the majority of the 127 women who had undergone RRSO 1 year previously (75 with <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> mutations; 52 with <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutations) felt that RRSO reduced their risk of both breast and ovarian cancer.<Reference refidx="259"/>  There was a wide range of risk perceptions for ovarian cancer noted in the group.  Twenty percent of <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutation carriers thought that their risk of ovarian cancer was completely eliminated; others had an inflated perception of their ovarian cancer risk both before and after surgery.  A small group of these women were further surveyed at about 3 years postsurgery and their risk perceptions did not change significantly during this extended time period. These findings suggest that important misperceptions about ovarian cancer risk may persist after RRSO. Additional genetic education and counseling may be warranted.</Para><Para id="_1046">A larger study assessed quality of life in women at high risk of ovarian cancer who opted for periodic gynecologic screening (GS) versus those who underwent RRSO.  Eight hundred forty-six high-risk women, 44% of whom underwent RRSO and 56% of whom chose GS, completed questionnaires evaluating quality of life, cancer-specific distress, endocrine symptoms, and sexual functioning.<Reference refidx="260"/>  Women in the RRSO group were a mean of 2.8 ±1.9 years from surgery and women in the GS group were a mean of 4.3 years from their first visit to a gynecologist for high-risk management. No statistical difference in overall quality of life was detected between the RRSO and GS groups.  When compared with the GS group, women who underwent RRSO had poorer sexual functioning and more endocrine symptoms such as vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and hot flashes.  Women who underwent RRSO experienced lower levels of breast and ovarian cancer distress and had a more favorable perception of cancer risk.</Para><Para id="_2420">Women (N = 182) at risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer  referred for genetic counseling were surveyed concerning their satisfaction with their choice of either RRSO or periodic screening (PS) (biannual pelvic examination with TVUS and CA-125 determination) to manage their ovarian cancer risk.<Reference refidx="261"/>  Overall satisfaction with both options was extremely high, but highest among those who chose RRSO over PS.  There were no other demographic or clinical factors that distinguished satisfaction level. There was higher decisional ambivalence among those who chose PS.</Para><Para id="_2386">A retrospective study assessed 98 <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation carriers who underwent  RRSO about their preoperative counseling regarding symptoms to expect  after surgery.<Reference refidx="262"/> The mean age at RRSO was 45.5 years (range, ages 32–63 years). Eighty-five percent pursued RRSO after learning that they harbored a <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation, and 48.0% were premenopausal at the time of surgery. Participants reported  ‘‘frequent’’ or ‘‘very frequent’’ postsurgical symptoms of vaginal dryness (52.1%), changes in interest in sex (50.0%), sleep disturbances (46.7%), changes in sex life (43.9%), and hot flashes (42.9%). Only vaginal dryness and hot flashes were commonly recalled to have been addressed preoperatively. While 96% would have the surgery again, participants reported that the discussion of the impact of surgery on their sex life (59.2%), risk of coronary heart disease (57.1%), and the availability of sex counseling (57.1%) would have been helpful. </Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_327"><Title>Interventions: Psychological</Title><Para id="_328">Several psychological interventions have been proposed for women who may

report.<Reference refidx="263"/>  Another recommends rehearsal of affective state in the context of
all potential outcomes of cancer genetic testing for <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName>.<Reference refidx="264"/>  As genetic
testing programs grow and the psychological outcomes and behavioral impact of
testing are further defined, there will be an increasing demand for
interventions to maximize the benefits of cancer genetic testing and minimize
the risks to carriers and family members.
</Para><Para id="_904">A randomized trial with 126 <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> mutation carriers evaluated whether psychological and behavioral outcomes of <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> testing are improved among mutation carriers by providing a psychosocial telephone counseling intervention in addition to standard genetic counseling.<Reference refidx="265"/> The intervention consisted of five 60- to 90-minute telephone counseling sessions. The first session was a semistructured clinical assessment interview designed to allow the mutation carrier to describe her experiences and reactions to <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> testing results. The second through the fourth telephone sessions were individualized to the concerns raised by the woman in the domains of making medical decisions, managing family concerns, and emotional reactions after the receipt of a positive <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> result. The final telephone session focused on integration and closure on the issues raised and implementation of a plan for short-term and long-term goals established during the telephone intervention.  Women most likely to complete the intervention were those who did not have a personal history of cancer; those who had higher levels of cancer-specific distress; those who were college graduates; and those who were employed. Outcome data from this study has not yet been reported. </Para><Para id="_331">A pilot study demonstrated the usefulness of a six-session psychoeducational
support group for women at high genetic risk of breast cancer who were
considering prophylactic mastectomy.  The themes for the group sessions
included overestimation of and anxiety about risk, desire for hard data,
emotional impact of watching a mother die of breast cancer, concerns about
spouse reactions, self-image and body image, the decision-making process, and
confusion about whom to trust in decision-making.  Both the participants and the
multidisciplinary leaders concluded that as a supplement to individual
counseling, a support group is a beneficial and cost-effective treatment
modality.<Reference refidx="266"/>
</Para><Para id="_2295">A prospective study from the Netherlands <Reference refidx="267"/>  involving 163 newly-identified <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation carriers with no history of cancer considered the effects of psychoeducational support sessions on completion of intended risk management preferences (breast cancer surveillance or prophylactic mastectomy). All were offered the opportunity to participate in eight sessions focused on psychosocial (five sessions) and medical information (three sessions)  after the receipt of test results. The number of women with a preference for mastectomy after receipt of test results who actually had a mastectomy at follow-up (median 2 years) was higher in the group that attended the psychoeducational support sessions than among those who did not attend (89% and 63%, respectively; OR, 4.8; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .04). </Para><Para id="_1193">Women who called the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service seeking information about breast or ovarian cancer risk, risk assessment, or cancer genetic testing, were randomly assigned to receive (1) general information about cancer risk and a referral to testing and counseling services or (2) an educational intervention designed to increase knowledge and understanding about inherited cancer risk, personal history of cancer, and the benefits and limitations of genetic testing. In the group receiving the educational intervention, intention to obtain genetic testing decreased among women at average breast cancer risk (as determined by the Gail model) and increased among women at high risk. Among average risk women, those in the intervention group identified as high monitors (i.e., those who seek and pay greater attention to threatening health-related information) demonstrated an increase in knowledge and breast cancer risk perceptions compared with low monitors (i.e., those who avoid attending to threatening health-related information).<Reference refidx="268"/></Para><Para id="_2662">Other minimally intensive interventions (e.g., leaflets) have been explored and show promise in reducing psychological distress while genetic testing results are pending and  after risk disclosure.<Reference refidx="269"/> Additional studies are needed to examine this type of  intervention, which is more readily disseminated on a wider scale.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_332"><Title>Behavioral Outcomes</Title><Para id="_333">A study <Reference refidx="270"/> of screening behaviors of 216 self-referred, high-risk (&gt;10% risk of carrying a <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> mutation) women who are members of hereditary breast cancer families found a range of screening practices.  Even the  presence of known mutations in their families was not associated with good adherence to recommended screening practices.  Sixty-nine percent of women aged 50 to 64 years and 83% of women aged 40 to 49 years had had a screening mammogram in the previous year.  Twenty percent of participants had ever had a CA-125 test and 31% had ever had a pelvic ultrasound or TVUS. Further analysis of this study population <Reference refidx="270"/> looking specifically at 107 women with informative <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> test results found good use of breast cancer screening, though the uptake rate in younger carriers is lower. The reason for the lower uptake rate was not explored in this study.<Reference refidx="271"/> One survey of screening behaviors among women at increased risk of breast/ovarian cancer identified physician recommendations as a significant factor in adherence to screening.<Reference refidx="272"/> </Para><Para id="_1021">While motivations cited for pursuing genetic testing often include the expectation that mutation carriers will be more compliant with breast and/or ovarian screening recommendations,<Reference refidx="270"/><Reference refidx="273"/><Reference refidx="274"/><Reference refidx="275"/> limited data exist about whether participants in genetic testing alter their screening behaviors over time and about other variables that may influence those behaviors, such as insurance coverage and physician recommendations or attitudes.
The impact of cancer genetic counseling on screening behaviors was assessed in a U.K. study of 293 women followed for 12 months postcounseling at  four cancer genetics clinics.<Reference refidx="276"/> BSE, CBE, and mammography were significantly increased after counseling; however, gaps in adherence to recommendations were noted: 38% of women aged 35 to 49 years had not had a mammogram by 12 months postcounseling. BSE was not done by most women at the recommended time and frequency. </Para><Para id="_334">This is a critical issue not only for women testing positive, but also for
adherence to screening for those testing negative and those who have
received <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000556497">indeterminate</GlossaryTermRef> results or choose not to receive their results.  It is
possible that adherence actually diminishes with a decrease in the perceived
risk that may result from a negative genetic test result.
</Para><Para id="_335">In addition, while there is still some question regarding the link between
cancer-related worry and breast cancer screening behavior, accumulating
evidence appears to support a linear rather than a curvilinear relationship. 
That is, for some time, the data were not consistent; some data supported the
hypothesis that mild-to-moderate worry may increase adherence, while excessive
worry may actually decrease the utilization of recommended screening practices. 
Other reports support the notion that a linear relationship is more likely;
that is, more worry increases adherence to screening recommendations.  Few
studies, however,  have followed women to assess their health behaviors
after genetic testing.  Thus, a negative test result leading to decreased
worry could theoretically result in decreased screening adherence.  A large study found that patient compliance with screening practices was not related to general or screening-specific anxiety—with the exception of BSE, for which compliance is negatively associated with procedure-specific anxiety.<Reference refidx="65"/> Further
research designed to clarify this potential concern would highlight the need
for comprehensive genetic counseling to discuss the need for follow-up
screening.  
 </Para><Para id="_336">Further complicating this area of research are issues such as the baseline rate
of mammography adherence among women older than 40 or 50 years before genetic
testing.  More specifically, the ability to note a significant difference in
adherence on this measure may be affected by the high adherence rate to this
screening behavior before genetic testing by women undergoing such testing.   It
may be easier to find significant changes in mammography use among women with a
family history of breast cancer who test positive.  Finally, adherence over
time will likely be affected by how women undergoing genetic
testing and their caregivers perceive the efficacy of many of the screening options
in question, such as mammography for younger women, BSE,
and ovarian cancer screening (periodic vaginal ultrasound and serum CA-125
measurements), along with the value of preventive interventions.</Para><Para id="_337">The issue of screening decision-making and adherence among women undergoing
genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer is the subject of several ongoing
trials, and an area of much needed ongoing study. </Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="16702359">Ropka ME, Wenzel J, Phillips EK, et al.: Uptake rates for breast cancer genetic testing: a systematic review.
