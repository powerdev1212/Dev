A PET-CT scan yields morphologic and metabolic data to assess the detection of  primary tumor, nodal disease, and distant metastatic disease; it may also be used to guide radiation therapy planning. Retrospective data demonstrate that morphologic and PET-glycolytic parameters, which are measured in fluorodeoxyglucose  PET-CT, are significantly larger in HPV-negative disease compared with HPV-positive disease in the primary tumor for oropharyngeal carcinoma. However, the same PET parameters are frequently larger in the regional nodal disease in patients with HPV-positive disease.<Reference refidx="36"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000587990">Level of evidence: 3iiDiv</LOERef>]</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">American Cancer Society: Cancer Facts and Figures 2004.

Similar findings showed equivalent overall and cause-specific survival between surgery versus radiation for tonsil carcinoma; however,  23% overall and cause-specific survival for severe complications in the surgery group versus 6% overall and cause-specific survival in the radiation therapy group (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001). </Para><Para id="_382">For patients with early-stage disease, single-modality treatment, usually radiation therapy alone, is preferred; however, emerging surgical techniques, including transoral surgery and transoral robotic surgery, are currently evolving. Nonrandomized comparisons suggest superior quality of life with minimally invasive surgical techniques.<Reference refidx="2"/> Historically, more invasive surgical techniques were associated with inferior quality of life and greater morbidity.</Para><Para id="_336">Historically, the post-therapy performance status of patients with base-of-tongue primary tumors appeared to be better after radiation therapy than

IMRT allows a dose-painting technique also known as a simultaneous-integrated-boost (SIB) technique with a dose per fraction slightly higher than 2 Gy, which allows slight shortening of overall treatment time and increases the biologically equivalent dose to the tumor.</Para><Para id="_339">IMRT was studied in a phase II trial (<ProtocolRef href="CDR0000068231" nct_id="NCT00006360">RTOG-0022</ProtocolRef> [NCT00006360]) of 69 patients with stage T1–2, N0–1, M0 oropharyngeal carcinoma who were treated with primary radiation therapy without chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="8"/> The median follow-up was 2.8 years. Prescribed planning target volume (PTV)-doses to the primary tumor and involved nodes was 66 Gy at 2.2 Gy per fraction over 6 weeks. Subclinical PTVs received simultaneously 54 to 60 Gy at 1.8 to 2.0 Gy per fraction using an SIB technique. The 2-year estimated local-regional failure rate was 9%. Two of four patients (50%), who had major underdose deviations, had locoregional failure compared with 3 of 49 patients (6%) without such deviations (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .04). Maximal late toxicities with a grade of 2 or greater were skin (12%), mucosa (24%), salivary (67%), esophagus (19%), and osteoradionecrosis (6%).</Para><Para id="_340">Longer follow-up revealed reduced late toxicity in all categories. Xerostomia grade 2 or greater was observed in 55% of patients at 6 months but was reduced to 25% of patients  at 12 months and 16% of patients at 24 months. The <ProtocolRef href="CDR0000068231" nct_id="NCT00006360">RTOG-0022</ProtocolRef>  study showed high control rates and the feasibility of IMRT at a multi-institutional level; the study also showed high tumor control rates and reduced salivary toxicity compared with previous RTOG studies. However, major target underdose deviations were associated with a higher locoregional failure rate. Similar nonrandomized multicenter studies using fractionally  escalated doses, which ranged from 2.3 to 2.5 Gy with IMRT, have been safe when given without concurrent chemotherapy for pharyngolaryngeal T2N0, T2N1, or laryngeal T3N0 squamous cell carcinoma.
