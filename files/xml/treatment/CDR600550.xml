Only Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), a dendritic cell disorder,  is discussed in detail in this summary. Erdheim-Chester disease (primarily found in adults) and juvenile xanthogranuloma (diagnosed in children and adults) are macrophage disorders. Other disorders of the macrophage/monocytoid lineages include Rosai-Dorfman disease and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Malignant disorders include malignant histiocytosis of various histiocyte lineages (formerly called histiocytic sarcoma) and the monocytic or myelomonocytic leukemias.</Para><Para id="_10">LCH results from the clonal proliferation of  immunophenotypically and functionally immature, morphologically rounded LCH cells along with eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and occasionally, multinucleated giant cells.<Reference refidx="1"/> The term <Emphasis>LCH cells</Emphasis> is used because there are clear morphologic, phenotypic, and gene expression differences between Langerhans cells of the epidermis (LCs) and those in LCH lesions (LCH cells). Controversy   exists regarding whether the clonal proliferation of LCH cells results from a malignant transformation or is the result of an immunologic stimulus.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/> </Para><Para id="_450">The recent discovery that approximately 60% of LCH biopsy specimens demonstrate the V600E mutation in the <GeneName>BRAF</GeneName> oncogene, regardless of stage or organ involvement, has led to the conclusion that LCH is a clonal neoplastic disorder. The same mutation has been found in other cancers, including malignant melanoma; however, V600E-mutated <GeneName>BRAF</GeneName> is also present in benign nevi, possibly indicating the need for additional mutations to render the cell malignant.<Reference refidx="4"/> This finding has raised the possibility of future targeted therapy with inhibitors already in use in melanoma, and several trials of <GeneName>BRAF</GeneName> inhibitors are open in adults and children with <GeneName>BRAF</GeneName> V600E mutated tumors, including LCH. Regardless of having a <GeneName>BRAF</GeneName> V600E mutation, nearly all lesions have been reported to show evidence of activated ERK downstream of <GeneName>BRAF</GeneName>; therefore, other mutations in genes that are part of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway might also be identified. This has been shown with activating mutations that involve the CSF-1 receptor, <GeneName>RAS</GeneName>, and <GeneName>MAP2K1</GeneName> (MEK) for a significant percentage of <GeneName>BRAF</GeneName> V600E–negative specimens.<Reference refidx="5"/> Regardless of the etiology of the clonal proliferation, the primary treatment is chemotherapy.</Para><Para id="_11"><Emphasis>Langerhans cell histiocytosis</Emphasis> is the  terminology currently preferred over <Emphasis>histiocytosis</Emphasis> X, <Emphasis>eosinophilic granuloma</Emphasis>, <Emphasis>Abt-Letterer-Siwe disease</Emphasis>, <Emphasis>Hand-Schuller-Christian disease</Emphasis>, or <Emphasis>diffuse reticuloendotheliosis</Emphasis>.  This is based on the observation that the pathologic histiocyte common to all of these diagnoses has the identical immunophenotypic characteristics including the presence of Birbeck granules identified by electron microscopy; in addition, the pathologic histiocyte or LCH cell has a gene expression profile more closely resembling a myeloid dendritic cell, raising the possibility that LCH cells arise from a circulating precursor cell rather than the skin LC.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/> (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000600550#_30" url="/types/langerhans/hp/langerhans-treatment-pdq">Cytogenetic and Genomic Studies</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information.)</Para><Para id="_280">LCH may involve a single organ (single-system LCH), which may be a single site (unifocal) or involve multiple sites (multifocal); or LCH may involve multiple organs  (multisystem LCH), which may involve a limited number of organs or be disseminated.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="12697451">Laman JD, Leenen PJ, Annels NE, et al.: Langerhans-cell histiocytosis 'insight into DC biology'.

The RAS signaling pathway (<SummaryRef href="CDR0000600550#_490" url="/types/langerhans/hp/langerhans-treatment-pdq">Figure</SummaryRef>) transmits signals from a cell surface receptor (e.g., a growth factor) through the RAS pathway (via one of the RAF proteins [A, B, or C]) to phosphorylate MEK and then extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which leads to nuclear signals affecting cell cycle and transcription regulation.

LCH cells have a portal (bile duct) tropism that  may lead to biliary damage and ductal sclerosis. A percutaneous (peripheral) liver biopsy may not be diagnostic of the infiltrate that tends to be more central in the liver, but will show the upstream obstructive effects of distal biliary occlusion. Hepatic enlargement can be accompanied by dysfunction, leading to hypoalbuminemia with ascites, hyperbilirubinemia, and clotting factor deficiencies.

While ultrasound and/or MRI-cholangiogram can be helpful in the diagnosis of this complication, liver biopsy is currently the only definitive way to determine whether active LCH or hepatic fibrosis is present. Biopsy results often show lymphocytes and biliary obstructive effects without LCH cells. Peribiliary LCH cells and, rarely, nodular masses of LCH, may also be present. It is thought that cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF)-beta, elaborated by lymphocytes during the active phase of the disease, leads to fibrosis and sclerosis around the bile ducts.<Reference refidx="17"/></Para><Para id="_287">Seventy-five percent of children with sclerosing cholangitis will not respond to chemotherapy because the LCH is no longer active, but the fibrosis and sclerosis remain.   Despite the limitations, liver biopsy may be the only way to distinguish active LCH from end-stage fibrosis. Liver transplantation is the only alternate  treatment when hepatic function worsens.  In one series of 28 children undergoing liver transplantation, 78% survived and 29% had recurrence of LCH, but only two cases of recurrent LCH occurred in the transplanted liver, although other cases have been reported since the initial data was published.<Reference refidx="18"/> If at all possible, active LCH should be under control before transplant.

Ultimately, widespread fibrosis and destruction of lung tissue may lead to severe pulmonary insufficiency.  Declining diffusion capacity may also herald the onset of pulmonary hypertension.<Reference refidx="25"/> Widespread fibrosis and declining diffusion capacity are much less common in children.

The risk of reactivations is unknown.</Para><Para id="_412">A consensus group reported on the evaluation and treatment of adult patients with LCH.<Reference refidx="1"/> However, discussion continues, particularly regarding optimal first-line therapy.</Para><SummarySection id="_142"><Title>Incidence </Title><Para id="_143">It is estimated that one to two adult cases of LCH occur per 1 million population.<Reference refidx="2"/> The true incidence of this disease is not known, however, because published studies are mostly nonpopulation based and the disorder is likely to be underdiagnosed.

LCH in adults is often similar to that in children, and appears to involve the same organs, although the proportions may be different. There is a predominance of lung disease in adults, usually occurring as single-system disease and closely associated with smoking and with some unique biologic characteristics. Most adult lung LCH cases are  polyclonal and possibly reactive, while the minority of lung LCH cases are monoclonal. A German registry with 121 registrants showed that 62% had single-organ involvement and 38% had multisystem involvement, while 34% of the total had lung involvement. The median age at diagnosis was 44 years ± 12.8 years. The most common organ involved was lung followed by bone and skin. All organ systems found in childhood LCH were seen, including endocrine and central nervous system, liver, spleen, bone marrow, and gastrointestinal tract. The major difference is the much higher incidence of isolated pulmonary LCH in adults, particularly in young adults who smoke. Other differences appear to be the more frequent involvement of genital and oral mucosa. There may possibly be a difference in the distribution of bone lesions, but both groups suffer reactivations of bone lesions and progression to diabetes insipidus, although the exact incidence is unknown in adults.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_146">Presenting symptoms from published studies are (in order of decreasing frequency) dyspnea or tachypnea, polydipsia and polyuria, bone pain, lymphadenopathy, weight loss, fever, gingival hypertrophy, ataxia, and memory problems. The signs of LCH are skin rash, scalp nodules, soft tissue swelling near bone lesions, lymphadenopathy, gingival hypertrophy, and hepatosplenomegaly.  Patients who present with isolated diabetes insipidus should be carefully observed for onset of other symptoms or signs characteristic of LCH.  At least 80% of patients with diabetes insipidus had involvement of other organ systems, including bone (68%),  skin (57%), lung (39%), and lymph nodes (18%).<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><SummarySection id="_147"><Title>Skin and oral cavity</Title><Para id="_332">Thirty-seven percent of adults with LCH have skin involvement which usually occurs as part of multisystem disease.

The cutaneous involvement is clinically similar to that seen in children and may take many forms.<Reference refidx="6"/> Infra-mammary and vulvar involvement may be seen in adult women with skin LCH.</Para><Para id="_148">Many patients have a papular rash with brown, red, or crusted areas ranging from the size of a pinhead to a dime. In the scalp, the rash is similar to that of seborrhea. Skin in the inguinal region, genitalia, or around the anus may have open ulcers that do not heal after antibacterial or antifungal therapy. The lesions are usually asymptomatic but may be pruritic or painful. In the mouth, swollen gums or ulcers along the cheeks, roof of the mouth, or tongue may be signs of LCH.</Para><Para id="_333">Diagnosis of LCH is usually made by skin biopsy performed for persistent skin lesions.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_149"><Title>Bones</Title><Para id="_150">The relative frequency of bone involvement in adults differs from that in children: mandible (30% vs. 7%) and skull (21% vs. 40%).<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>  The frequency of vertebrae (13%), pelvis (13%), extremities (17%), and rib (6%) lesions in adults are similar to those found in children.<Reference refidx="2"/> </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_151"><Title>Lung</Title><Para id="_334">Pulmonary LCH in adults is usually single-system disease, but in a minority of patients other organs may be involved, including bone (18%), skin (13%), and diabetes insipidus (5%).<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_152">Pulmonary LCH is more prevalent in smokers than in nonsmokers and the male to female ratio may be near unity depending on the incidence of smoking in the population studied.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> Patients with pulmonary LCH usually present with a dry cough, dyspnea, or chest pain, although nearly 20% of adults with lung involvement have no symptoms.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/> Chest pain may indicate a spontaneous pneumothorax (10%–20% of adult pulmonary LCH cases).
