In the United States in 2015, about 61,560 cases of kidney cancer and renal pelvis cancer are expected to occur and lead to more than 14,080 deaths.<Reference refidx="1"/> This cancer accounts for about 4% of all the adult malignancies. The male-to-female ratio is 1.5:1.<Reference refidx="2"/> RCC is distinct from kidney cancer that involves the renal pelvis or renal medulla, and it only applies to cancer that forms in the lining of the kidney bed (i.e., in the renal tubules). Genetic <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046063">mutations</GlossaryTermRef> have been identified as the cause of inherited cancer risk in some RCC cancer–prone families; these mutations are estimated to account for only 1% to 2% of RCC cases overall.<Reference refidx="3"/>  It is likely that other undiscovered genes and background genetic factors contribute to the development of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460148">familial</GlossaryTermRef> RCC in conjunction with nongenetic risk factors.  About 80% of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339347">sporadic</GlossaryTermRef> RCC is of clear cell histopathology.<Reference refidx="2"/>  Non–renal cell cancers of the kidney, including cancer of the renal pelvis or renal medulla, are not addressed in this summary.</Para><Para id="_560">RCC occurs in both sporadic and heritable forms.  The following four major <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339338">autosomal dominantly inherited</GlossaryTermRef> RCC syndromes have been identified:</Para><ItemizedList id="_561" Style="bullet">

(Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062894" url="/types/kidney/hp/kidney-treatment-pdq">Renal Cell Cancer Treatment</SummaryRef> for more information and the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062937" url="/types/kidney/hp/transitional-cell-treatment-pdq">Transitional Cell Cancer of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter Treatment</SummaryRef> for more information about sporadic kidney cancer.) </Para><SummarySection id="_12"><Title>Natural History Varies by Histopathology</Title><Para id="_13">The natural history of each of the RCCs varies according to the characteristic histopathology of the renal tumors that arise in the specific syndrome.  Although it is useful to follow the predominant reported natural history of each syndrome, each individual <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460124">affected</GlossaryTermRef> will need to be evaluated and monitored for occasional individual variations.  The individual prognosis will depend upon the characteristics of the renal tumor at the time of detection and intervention and will differ for each syndrome (VHL, HPRC, BHD, and HLRCC).  Prognostic determinants at diagnosis include the stage of the RCC, whether the tumor is confined to the kidney, primary tumor size, Fuhrman nuclear grade, and multifocality.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_14"><Title>Family History as a Risk Factor for RCC</Title><Para id="_15">Epidemiologic studies of RCC suggest that a family history of RCC is a risk factor for the disease.  The relative risk (RR) is estimated to be 2.5 for a sibling of an RCC-affected patient.  This observation was reproducible in a number of studies.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/>  Analysis of renal carcinomas up to the year 2000  in the Sweden Family-Cancer Database, which includes all Swedes born since 1931 and their biological parents, led to the observation that risk of RCC was particularly high in the siblings of those affected with RCC.  The higher RR in siblings than  in parent-child pairs suggests that a recessive gene contributes to the development of sporadic renal carcinoma.<Reference refidx="7"/>  Investigators in Iceland studied all patients in Iceland who developed RCC between 1955 and 1999 (1,078 cases).  In addition, they used an extensive computerized database to perform a unique genealogic study that included more than 600,000 Icelandic individuals.  The results revealed that nearly 60% of RCC patients in Iceland during this time period had either a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460150">first-degree relative</GlossaryTermRef> or a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000485395">second-degree relative</GlossaryTermRef> with RCC.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_16">Because RCC accounts for only about 4% of all adult malignancies in the United States,<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="9"/> the presence of two or more family members with RCC may suggest a hereditary etiology. Having a relative affected with kidney cancer is one of the known epidemiologic risk factors for this disease.  There is a 2.5 times greater chance of RCC arising in a sibling of an affected individual than in someone in the general population.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="10"/>   Young age at onset is also a clue to possible hereditary etiology. In contrast with sporadic RCC, which is generally diagnosed during the fifth to seventh decades of life, hereditary forms of kidney cancer are generally diagnosed at an earlier age. In a review from the National Cancer Institute of over 600 cases of hereditary kidney cancer, the median age at diagnosis was 37 years, with 70% of the cases being diagnosed at age 46 years or younger,<Reference refidx="11"/> compared with a median age at diagnosis of 64 years in the overall population.<Reference refidx="12"/>.  Bilaterality and multifocality are common in most heritable RCC, except in HLRCC. </Para><Para id="_749">There is no consensus regarding whom to refer for genetic consultation for a possible hereditary kidney cancer syndrome, although the following organizations have offered guidance:</Para><ItemizedList id="_750" Style="bullet">

Smoking, hypertension, and obesity   are the major  environmental and lifestyle risk factors associated with RCC.<Reference refidx="9"/> In addition, workers who were reportedly exposed to the environmental carcinogen trichloroethylene developed sporadic clear cell RCC, presumably due to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046586">somatic mutations</GlossaryTermRef> in the <GeneName>VHL</GeneName> gene.<Reference refidx="15"/>  Dietary intake of vegetables and fruits has been inversely associated with RCC. Greater intake of red meat and milk products have been associated with increased RCC risk, although not consistently.<Reference refidx="16"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">American Cancer Society: Cancer Facts and Figures 2015.

Some of the initial surgical series focused on performing a bilateral radical nephrectomy for renal tumors followed by a renal transplantation.<Reference refidx="85"/><Reference refidx="86"/>

Nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) for VHL was introduced in the 1980s after several groups demonstrated a low risk of cancer dissemination with a less-radical surgical approach.<Reference refidx="87"/><Reference refidx="88"/>
In 1995, a large, multi-institutional series demonstrated how NSS could produce excellent cancer-specific survival in patients with RCC.<Reference refidx="89"/>
 Because of multiple reports of excellent outcomes, when feasible, NSS is now considered the surgical standard of care. Over time, the technique of NSS in this population has been refined to minimize damage to the adjacent normal parenchyma.  To avoid the taking of a wide margin, enucleative resection was developed and allows the tumor and pseudocapsule to be shelled off the surrounding adjacent normal parenchyma.<Reference refidx="90"/></Para><Para id="_721">Patients with VHL can have dozens of renal tumors; therefore, resection of all evidence of disease may not be feasible. To minimize the morbidity of multiple surgical procedures, loss of kidney function, and the risk of distant progression, a specific timing for intervention was questioned. The National Cancer Institute evaluated a specific size threshold to trigger surgical intervention. An evaluation of 52 patients treated before the largest lesion reached 3 cm demonstrated no evidence of distant metastases or need for renal replacement therapy at a median follow-up of 60 months.<Reference refidx="52"/>  Later series reinforced that this was an important threshold because 0 of 108 patients with tumors managed at 3 cm or smaller had evidence of distant spread.<Reference refidx="91"/> For patients with tumors larger than 3 cm, a total of 27.3% (20 of 73) developed distant recurrence.<Reference refidx="91"/>
 This threshold is now widely used to trigger surgical intervention for VHL-associated ccRCC. When surgery is performed on a patient with VHL, resection of more than a dozen renal tumors may be necessary.<Reference refidx="92"/>
The use of intraoperative ultrasound to identify and then remove smaller lesions may delay the need for further surgical interventions.<Reference refidx="93"/>
</Para><Para id="_722">Many patients with VHL develop new RCCs on an ongoing basis and may  require further intervention. Adhesions and perinephric scarring make subsequent surgical procedures more challenging. While a radical nephrectomy could be considered, NSS is still the preferred approach, when feasible. While there may be a higher incidence of complications, repeat and salvage NSS can enable patients to maintain excellent renal functional outcomes and provide promising oncologic outcomes at intermediate follow-up.<Reference refidx="94"/><Reference refidx="95"/>

These surgeries may be best handled at a specialized center with significant experience with this surgical approach.<Reference refidx="96"/></Para><Para id="_683"><LOERef href="CDR0000531840">Level of evidence: 3di</LOERef></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_610"><Title>Ablative techniques</Title><SummarySection id="_723"><Title>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and cryoablation (CA)</Title><Para id="_724">Thermal ablative techniques utilize either heating or cooling of a mass in an effort to destroy the tumor. Cryoablation (CA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) were introduced into the management of small renal masses in the late 1990s.<Reference refidx="97"/><Reference refidx="98"/>
For sporadic renal masses, both thermal ablative techniques have a nearly 90% recurrence-free survival rate, leading the American Urologic Association to consider this as a recommendation in high-risk patients with a small renal mass.<Reference refidx="99"/> For patients with VHL, the clinical applications of ablative techniques are still not clearly defined, and surgery is still the most-studied intervention. Ablative techniques were first introduced into the management of VHL-associated RCC in a phase II trial investigating the effects of ablation at the time of lesion resection. In this study, 11 tumors were treated, and an intra-operative ultrasound showed complete elimination of blood flow to the tumors; on final pathology, there was evidence of treatment effect on all tumors.<Reference refidx="100"/>
Since this time, some centers have utilized thermal ablative techniques for primary and salvage management in patients with VHL with good success.<Reference refidx="101"/> Other centers have found that techniques such as RFA have a higher failure rate and should be reserved for patients with marginal renal function.<Reference refidx="102"/> Despite limited long-term data, these techniques have been increasingly utilized in the treatment of RCC in patients with VHL. A single-institution study evaluated treatment trends in RCC in 113 patients with VHL. Between 2004 and 2009, 43% of cases were managed with RFA at this center.<Reference refidx="103"/></Para><Para id="_725">Thermal ablation may play an increasing role in the salvage therapy setting for individuals with a high risk of morbidity from surgery. Cryoablation as salvage therapy was evaluated in a series of 14 patients to avoid the morbidity of repeat NSS. There was minimal change in renal function; at a median follow-up of 37 months, there was suspicion for lesion recurrence in only 4 of 33 tumors treated.<Reference refidx="104"/>
 However, it must be cautioned that surgery after thermal ablation is a very challenging endeavor, with a significantly higher rate of postoperative complications due to adhesions and scarring, especially along the tract of the ablative probes.<Reference refidx="105"/><Reference refidx="106"/>
<Reference refidx="107"/> In younger individuals who may need further surgical management in their lifetimes, clinicians must consider how a thermal ablation could impact future RCC management.<Reference refidx="96"/><Reference refidx="108"/></Para><Para id="_711">The clinical applications of ablative techniques in VHL are still not clearly defined, and surgery is still the most-studied intervention. The available clinical evidence suggests that ablative approaches be reserved for small (≤3 cm), solid-enhancing renal masses in older patients with high operative risk, especially in patients facing salvage renal surgery because of a higher complication rate. Young age, tumor size larger than 4 cm, hilar tumors, and cystic lesions can be regarded as relative contraindications. Irreversible coagulopathy is widely accepted as an absolute contraindication.<Reference refidx="109"/><Reference refidx="110"/></Para></SummarySection><Para id="_685"><LOERef href="CDR0000531840">Level of evidence: 3di</LOERef></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_578"><Title>Chemotherapy</Title><Para id="_579">A 2011 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of sunitinib in VHL patients.<Reference refidx="111"/> Fifteen patients  with VHL were given 50 mg of sunitinib daily for 28 days, followed by 14 days off for up to four cycles, with a primary endpoint of toxicity.
