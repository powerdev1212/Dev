<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046704">pancreatic enzymes</GlossaryTermRef> in a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef> management program. The <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045864">regimen</GlossaryTermRef> is intended to detoxify the body, correct nervous system imbalances that might lead to impaired general health, and support natural <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356">immune</GlossaryTermRef> processes. The pancreatic enzymes are thought to be the specific anticancer component of the Gonzalez program.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_11">Two major concepts underlie use of the Gonzalez regimen in cancer treatment. The first concept is that the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046254">pancreas</GlossaryTermRef>, like the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046312">liver</GlossaryTermRef>, is an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000257523">organ</GlossaryTermRef> that performs a detoxification function and that pancreatic enzymes help the body eliminate <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046622">toxins</GlossaryTermRef> and help normal <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046476">cells</GlossaryTermRef> repair damaged cells.<Reference refidx="2"/>  The second concept is that cancer and most other human illness are related to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045837">physiological</GlossaryTermRef> imbalances created by environmental toxins either consumed in food or contacted in the environment.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_13">Proponents of the Gonzalez regimen believe that toxins from sources such as processed foods and environmental pollution are responsible for human cancers. These toxins are thought to accumulate in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissues</GlossaryTermRef> and over time create imbalances in the autonomic nervous system, diminish the normal <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045722">immune response</GlossaryTermRef>, and give rise to cellular damage that can lead to cancer.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/> If these toxins could be neutralized and eliminated from the body, proponents believe, both early and established cancers would be halted, and general health would be restored.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_64">According to the developer of the Gonzalez regimen, the diets used in this regimen are chosen for each patient according to individual <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044056">metabolic</GlossaryTermRef> profiles  established at the time of initial evaluation through various tests, including hair <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000390238">analysis</GlossaryTermRef>.  There are ten    basic diets and 90 variations.<Reference refidx="2"/> The diets emphasize organic foods. Each diet carries a particular focus and can range from strictly vegetarian diets to diets high in meat and fat. Variations in the diets correlate with the theory that imbalances in the autonomic nervous system are exacerbated by a diet that is inappropriate for the patient’s metabolic type.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_65">Nutritional supplements employed in the Gonzalez regimen include <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044744">vitamins</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045787">minerals</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044573">trace elements</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000446104">amino acids</GlossaryTermRef>, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000407760">extracts</GlossaryTermRef> of animal organs (e.g., <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046616">thymus</GlossaryTermRef> and liver extracts from sheep or cows). As with the dietary protocols, the nutritional supplements are intended to correct autonomic nervous system imbalances.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_66">The major feature of the Gonzalez regimen is  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044150">freeze-dried</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000446108">porcine</GlossaryTermRef> pancreatic enzyme (PPE) administered in capsule form as part of the nutritional <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045916">supplementation</GlossaryTermRef> aspect of the program. Obtained from pigs, PPE is considered to be the primary cancer-fighting component in the regimen and to contribute to the overall detoxification process.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_67">Proponents of the regimen believe that the pancreatic enzymes are delivered to the bloodstream and help the body eliminate and destroy <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044636">abnormal</GlossaryTermRef> cells, waste material, and abnormal <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046092">proteins</GlossaryTermRef> that are <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043986">toxic</GlossaryTermRef> to the body.  As the body detoxifies, the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancerous</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumors</GlossaryTermRef> tend to shrink.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_68">Coffee enemas are also included as part of the detoxification process.  The enemas are administered twice daily.<Reference refidx="3"/>   The use of coffee enemas is based on a belief that coffee introduced into the lower <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044046">intestinal</GlossaryTermRef> tract will improve liver function and stimulate emptying of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046395">gallbladder</GlossaryTermRef>, thereby enhancing the elimination of toxins and waste products from the body.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_70">The Gonzalez regimen is available only to private patients of its New York-based practitioner.</Para><Para id="_71">Pancreatic enzymes are sold in the United States as either <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044711">prescription</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000348921">drugs</GlossaryTermRef> indicated for pancreatic insufficiency <Reference refidx="4"/> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044696">over-the-counter</GlossaryTermRef> (OTC) dietary supplements.   As of 2004, those sold as prescription drugs must have a New Drug              Approval  from the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454785">US   Food and Drug Administration</GlossaryTermRef> (FDA) to be marketed legally in the United States.   Pancreatic enzymes sold as OTC dietary supplements are regulated as foods, not drugs.   Dietary supplements in the United States are therefore sold without a requirement of a market approval by the FDA, as long as they do not claim to treat or prevent a specific disease or condition.  According to the developer of the Gonzalez regimen, most OTC preparations or other commercially available pancreatic enzymes are not effective against cancer.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_73">For the FDA, PPE falls under the category of a new prescription drug that is under investigation.  To conduct <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044168">clinical</GlossaryTermRef> drug research in the United States, researchers must file an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044763">Investigational</GlossaryTermRef> New Drug (IND) application with the FDA. To date, only one group of investigators is known to have IND approval to study this pancreatic enzyme preparation as a treatment for cancer. The IND process is confidential, and the existence of an IND can be disclosed only by the applicant(s). </Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="10368805">Gonzalez NJ, Isaacs LL: Evaluation of pancreatic proteolytic enzyme treatment of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, with nutrition and detoxification support.

Dr. Kelley’s approach espoused, among other things, the use of pancreatic enzymes administered <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044068">orally</GlossaryTermRef> as anticancer agents.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>  The use of enzymes as a treatment for cancer was originally proposed nearly a century ago <Reference refidx="6"/> and then resurfaced in the work of  Dr. Max Gerson in the 1940s.<Reference refidx="7"/> The Gonzalez <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045864">regimen</GlossaryTermRef> was developed from these earlier theories and approaches.
</Para><Para id="_99">A key concept underlying the original use of pancreatic enzymes for cancer treatment is  the trophoblastic theory of cancer.<Reference refidx="8"/> When a human egg is fertilized by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000257221">sperm</GlossaryTermRef>, the early <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046476">cell </GlossaryTermRef>divisions produce a small ball of cells, which give rise to the blastocyst (preimplantation <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044202">embryo</GlossaryTermRef>). The blastocyst possesses a surrounding layer of cells known as the trophectoderm, which is made of individual cells called trophoblasts. Responsible for protecting the developing blastocyst and for mediating its attachment to the wall of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046645">uterus</GlossaryTermRef>, trophoblasts create the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045017">placenta</GlossaryTermRef>. During the process of attaching the blastocyst to the uterine wall, trophoblasts express invasive qualities similar to those found in cancer cells. Trophoblasts, however, cease their invasive activity once the placenta is in place and functioning and then differentiate into other cell types.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_76">When Scottish embryologist Dr. John Beard <Reference refidx="6"/> first observed the invasive activity of trophoblasts in 1902, he speculated on the similarities between these cells and cancer cells. In addition, he observed that trophoblast invasiveness begins to decline at about the same time that the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046254">pancreas</GlossaryTermRef> in the developing fetus begins to function. He also theorized that maternal pancreatic enzymes might play a role in containing trophoblastic invasiveness in the uterus. These considerations led to his proposal that cancer cells, like trophoblasts, arise from primordial <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046382">germ cells</GlossaryTermRef>.    Dr. Beard also thought  that some of these primordial cells—carrying <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000257211">latent</GlossaryTermRef> capacities for invading tissues—could escape and spread throughout the body of the developing fetus. He thought it was possible that pancreatic enzymes modulated the degree of trophoblastic invasiveness in the uterus, he suggested that these same enzymes play a role in either limiting or eliminating <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancerous</GlossaryTermRef> cells elsewhere in the body.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="8"/>  Dr. Beard worked before the advent of molecular biology and human <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046391">genetics</GlossaryTermRef>. Although unable to experimentally establish that pancreatic enzymes had anticancer effects, he published papers and a book about his theory between 1902 and 1911. Other scientists of the time raised significant objections to the trophoblastic theory of cancer, and it was never broadly accepted.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_77">As Dr. Beard had before him, Dr. Kelley also asserted that trophoblasts and cancer cells have a common origin in primordial germ cells.  Dr. Kelley maintained, furthermore, that cancer was initiated when primordial germ cells migrated to a point in the body already weakened by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043986">toxic</GlossaryTermRef> exposure and nervous system imbalance. At these presumably compromised sites, the germ cells met no opposition from the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356">immune system</GlossaryTermRef> and initiated an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046053">aggressive</GlossaryTermRef> invasion of normal <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissue</GlossaryTermRef>, creating <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045771">malignancy</GlossaryTermRef>. Dr. Kelley’s treatment approach was based on the belief that primordial germ cells are the single cause of all cancers, no matter where they occur, and that pancreatic enzymes are able to suppress or destroy cancers.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_78">Dr. Gonzalez incorporated many of Dr. Beard’s and Dr. Kelley’s key points into his own 
treatment regimen.  In addition, the Gonzalez regimen includes the rigorous dietary protocols, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044698">nutritional</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045916">supplements</GlossaryTermRef>, and coffee enemas that can be found in the earlier work of Dr. Max Gerson.<Reference refidx="7"/>  The Gonzalez regimen now includes use of pancreatic enzymes, along with nutritional supplements, coffee enemas, and prescriptive <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044660">diets</GlossaryTermRef> based on a theory 
of autonomic dominance.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_79">An example of the Gonzalez regimen for a patient with pancreatic <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046216">adenocarcinoma</GlossaryTermRef> would be the following:</Para><OrderedList id="_98" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>A diet that emphasizes fresh raw fruits, raw and lightly steamed vegetables, and freshly made vegetable juice daily.  The diet protocol relies on plant-based sources such as cereals, nuts, and seeds and whole-grain products such as whole-grain bread and brown rice.  The patient may eat one or two eggs daily, whole-milk yogurt daily, and fish two or three times a week, but no red meat or poultry.  </ListItem><ListItem>Nutritional supplements that include <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044744">vitamins</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045787">minerals</GlossaryTermRef>, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044573">trace elements</GlossaryTermRef>. Also prescribed are certain <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044150">freeze-dried</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000257523">organ</GlossaryTermRef> concentrates such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046616">thymus</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046312">liver</GlossaryTermRef>, derived from beef or lamb.</ListItem><ListItem><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044100">Ingestion</GlossaryTermRef> of 25 g to 40 g of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000446108">porcine</GlossaryTermRef> lyophilized pancreas product daily, in capsule form, taken away from meals and spread evenly throughout the day.<Reference refidx="2"/></ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_80">The total number of capsules taken per day by each cancer patient on the Gonzalez regimen   typically ranges from 130 to 160, taken with and away from meals.<Reference refidx="2"/> In addition, the Gonzalez regimen uses coffee enemas on the premise that coffee absorbed through the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044046">intestinal</GlossaryTermRef> wall will improve liver and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046395">gallbladder</GlossaryTermRef> function and help increase the removal of toxic waste from <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumor</GlossaryTermRef> breakdown.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="4"/>  At this time there is no scientific evidence that coffee enemas have any specific effects on increased liver function, effects on tumor breakdown detoxification, or a role in the treatment of any cancer. </Para><Para id="_81">Doubts exist about the effectiveness of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044068">oral</GlossaryTermRef> administration of pancreatic enzymes because pancreatic enzymes were not thought to be transported intact from the gut to the bloodstream.

Sixty Fischer F344 female rats were divided into five groups of 12 each.  All groups were fed the same basic <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044660">diet</GlossaryTermRef>.   After 5 days, R13762 transplantable rat <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044560">mammary</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumor</GlossaryTermRef> was <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000285636">implanted</GlossaryTermRef> into a mammary fat pad on each rat.

However, when the rate of metastases in the
rats dosed at the 20% rate was compared with those dosed at 2%, it was noted that there was an increase in metastases in the rats given a higher dose of PPP.

The treatment group (14 mice) received PPE in water at a dose of 400 mg/kg of body weight, which corresponds to the dose used in patients receiving the Gonzalez regimen.  The <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044149">control group</GlossaryTermRef> (13 mice) was given only water. After death, the pancreas was removed and measured for volume and weight.  The <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000655249">median survival</GlossaryTermRef> rates for the treatment group and the control group were 43.5 days and 35 days, respectively. At day 35, the survival rates were 79% in the treatment group and 38% in the control group.  In addition, the control mice showed reduced activity as compared with the treatment group, which showed normal activity and no signs of disease.  In general, the size of tumors and the rate of invasion in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046312">liver</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045829">peritoneum</GlossaryTermRef> correlated with length of survival time.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_86">In the tumor growth segment of this study, a second group of 30 mice was taken through the same procedures.  Tumor size and weight were measured in two mice from each group on day 52, and again in two mice from the control group and five mice from the treatment group on day 60.  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045601">Ascites</GlossaryTermRef> were much more apparent in the control group than in the treatment group. Physical activity among the treated mice was much greater than in the control group.  Results showed that the treatment group had significantly smaller tumors than the control group in both weight and volume.  The <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000285973">mean</GlossaryTermRef> tumor weight was 1.2 g in the control group and 0.75 g in the treatment group.  The tumor volume was 0.42 cm<Superscript>3</Superscript> in the treatment group and 0.91 cm<Superscript>3</Superscript>  in the control group.  All mice in the control group showed steatorrhea, hyperglycosuria, hyperbilirubinuria, and ketonuria in the early <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045885">stages</GlossaryTermRef> of tumor growth, whereas in the treated group only a few mice showed these abnormalities in the final stages.

None of the patients had received <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045214">chemotherapy</GlossaryTermRef> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044971">radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef>, and none had undergone <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046565">surgical resection</GlossaryTermRef> with curative intent.

Survival from the time of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046450">diagnosis</GlossaryTermRef> was the only study <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000346519">endpoint</GlossaryTermRef>, and all 11 patients (including one who left the study) were included in this survival <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000390238">analysis</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para><Para id="_89">The investigators reported a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000655249">median survival</GlossaryTermRef> time of 17 months and a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000285974">mean survival time</GlossaryTermRef> of 25.2 months for these patients.  Nine patients (82%) survived 1 year, five patients (45%) survived 2 years, and four patients (36%) survived 3 years.  At the time the study was reported, two patients were alive: one who had survived 3 years, and one  had survived 4 years. The researchers concluded that the 1-year and 2-year survival percentages for this group of patients were superior to those observed for other U.S. patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (1-year survival, all stages = 25%; 2-year survival, all stages = 10%).<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_90">The small number of patients in this study and the absence of a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044149">control group</GlossaryTermRef> are limitations that raise doubts about the reliability of its findings. It is possible that important, unidentified differences between these patients and other patients diagnosed with stage II to stage  IV pancreatic cancer contributed to the relatively long survival. The investigators report that 25 additional patients with pancreatic cancer were seen during the study period but were excluded from study participation.  Eleven of these patients were excluded on the basis of  comorbidities, previous treatment, or delay between diagnosis and beginning the program; 14 otherwise eligible patients were excluded on the grounds that they chose not to start the program, complied only briefly, or predicted noncompliance.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_91">The second study is a nonrandomized prospective case-control observational study  sponsored by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine  and the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044266">National Cancer Institute</GlossaryTermRef> in which median survival and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef> were found to be better in patients treated  with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045347">gemcitabine</GlossaryTermRef>-based (i.e., other <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000348921">drugs</GlossaryTermRef> may be included) chemotherapy than for patients treated with the Gonzalez regimen.

The  same <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000346518">eligibility criteria</GlossaryTermRef> were used to select patients for both treatment arms. The results of this study were reported in the peer-reviewed Journal of Clinical Oncology.<Reference refidx="2"/>               According to the report, 70 patients were evaluated for the study and 55 were enrolled: 23 in the gemcitabine arm and 32 in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046081">enzyme</GlossaryTermRef> treatment arm. The enzyme treatment included orally ingested proteolytic enzymes, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463726">nutritional supplements</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000446105">detoxification</GlossaryTermRef>, and an organic <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044660">diet</GlossaryTermRef> (as used in  the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045838">pilot study</GlossaryTermRef> by Gonzalez and Isaacs).<Reference refidx="1"/> Patients received three <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044074">pancreatic</GlossaryTermRef> enzyme <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000455334">capsules</GlossaryTermRef> and two <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000373087">magnesium</GlossaryTermRef> citrate capsules with each meal.

The <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044664">dose</GlossaryTermRef> for patients with stage II disease was 69 enzyme capsules per day, and the dose for patients with stages III or stage IV was 81 capsules per day. After day 16, patients had a 5-day rest period and then resumed treatment on day 22. Patients in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044758">experimental</GlossaryTermRef> arm received proteolytic treatment under the care of a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463164">practitioner</GlossaryTermRef> familiar with the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045864">regimen</GlossaryTermRef>; those in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045214">chemotherapy</GlossaryTermRef> arm received treatment by the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046260">oncologist</GlossaryTermRef> they selected.<Reference refidx="2"/> Treatment could be adjusted by the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000390246">physician</GlossaryTermRef>, and it could be increased for <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer </GlossaryTermRef><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044078">progression</GlossaryTermRef>.  The gemcitabine treatment patients received various gemcitabine-containing regimens, with 19 of the 23 patients receiving a combination of gemcitabine, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045565">capecitabine</GlossaryTermRef>, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045382">docetaxel</GlossaryTermRef>. The two groups had similar clinical characteristics. The  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000655249">median survival</GlossaryTermRef> for the patients in the gemcitabine arm was 14 months and, on the enzyme arm, 4.3 months. The quality of life as measured by the FACT-PA was also better in the chemotherapy arm.  The paper does not list Dr. Gonzalez as an author, and does not identify him as participating in the study; however,  Dr. Gonzalez published comments on his Web site indicating his participation  in the study and detailing his concerns about how the study was conducted, including patient compliance with the prescribed treatment in the enzyme arm.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_92">No data concerning the effectiveness of the Gonzalez regimen for the treatment of cancer  patients with other types of cancer have been reported, despite claims that a variety of cancers can be treated.
