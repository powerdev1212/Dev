cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team
of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during
childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the primary care physician, pediatric surgical subspecialists, radiation
oncologist, pediatric oncologist/hematologist, rehabilitation specialists,
pediatric nurse specialists, social workers, and others  to ensure that
children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation that will
achieve optimal survival and quality of life.  (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000595857" url="/types/childhood-cancers/pediatric-care-hp-pdq">Pediatric Supportive Care</SummaryRef> for specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer.)</Para><Para id="_156">Guidelines for pediatric cancer
centers and their role in the treatment of pediatric patients with cancer have
been outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics.<Reference refidx="2"/>  At these pediatric
cancer centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer
that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity to participate in
these trials is offered to most patients/families.  Clinical trials for
children and adolescents with cancer are generally designed to compare
potentially better therapy with therapy that is currently accepted as standard. 
Most of the progress made in identifying curative therapies for
childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.  Information about
ongoing clinical trials is available from the <ExternalRef xref="http://cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/">NCI  Web site.</ExternalRef></Para><Para id="_170">Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer.<Reference refidx="1"/> Between 1975 and 2010, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.<Reference refidx="1"/> For rhabdomyosarcoma, the 5-year survival rate increased over the same time, from 53% to 67% for children younger than 15 years  and from 30% to 51% for adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close follow-up because cancer therapy side effects may persist or develop months or years after treatment.

Relapses, however, are more common in patients who  have gross residual disease in unfavorable sites after initial surgery and in those who have metastatic disease at diagnosis.<Reference refidx="39"/></Para><Para id="_605">Examples of both
clinical and biological factors with proven or possible prognostic significance
include the following: 
</Para><ItemizedList id="_588" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem><Strong>Age:</Strong> Children aged 1 to 9 years have the best prognosis, while those younger and older fare less well. In recent IRSG trials, 5-year failure-free survival (FFS) was 57% for patients younger than 1 year, 81% for patients aged 1 to 9 years, and 68% for patients older than 10 years. Five-year survival for these groups was 76%, 87%, and 76%, respectively.<Reference refidx="6"/> Historical data show that adults fare worse than children (5-year overall survival (OS) rates, 27% ± 1.4% and 61% ± 1.4%, respectively; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .0001).<Reference refidx="40"/><Reference refidx="41"/><Reference refidx="42"/><Reference refidx="43"/><ItemizedList id="_609" Style="dash" Compact="No"><ListItem><Emphasis>Infants</Emphasis> may do poorly because their bone marrow is less tolerant of chemotherapy doses that older children can receive; thus, infants are relatively underdosed compared with older patients. In addition, infants younger than 1 year may be less likely to receive radiation therapy for local control, because of concern about the high incidence of complications in this age group.  <Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="38"/><Reference refidx="44"/> Thus, they have a relatively high rate of local failure. </ListItem><ListItem>In <Emphasis>older children</Emphasis>, vincristine and dactinomycin have upper dosage limits based on body surface area, and these patients may also require reduced vincristine doses because of neurotoxicity.<Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="45"/></ListItem><ListItem><Emphasis>Adolescents:</Emphasis> A report from the AIEOP (Italian) Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee suggests that adolescents may have more frequent unfavorable tumor characteristics, including alveolar histology, regional lymph node involvement, and metastatic disease involvement, accounting for their poor prognosis.  This  study also found that 5-year OS and progression-free survival rates were somewhat lower in adolescents than in children, but the differences among age groups younger than 1 year and aged 10 to 19 years at diagnosis were significantly worse than those in the group aged 1 to 9 years.<Reference refidx="46"/></ListItem></ItemizedList></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Site of origin:</Strong> Primary sites with more favorable prognoses include the following:<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="47"/><Reference refidx="48"/> <ItemizedList id="_610" Style="dash"><ListItem>Orbit and nonparameningeal head and neck.</ListItem><ListItem>Paratestis, vulva, vagina, uterus (nonbladder, nonprostate genitourinary tract).</ListItem><ListItem>Biliary tract.</ListItem></ItemizedList></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Diameter of the tumor:</Strong> Patients with
smaller tumors (≤5 cm) have improved survival compared  with children with
larger tumors.<Reference refidx="7"/> Both tumor volume and maximum tumor diameter are associated with outcome.<Reference refidx="37"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335144">Level of evidence: 3iiA</LOERef>] <Para id="_616">A retrospective review of soft tissue sarcomas in children and adolescents suggests that the 5 cm cutoff used for adults with soft tissue sarcoma may not be ideal for smaller children, especially infants. The review identified an interaction between tumor diameter and body surface area (BSA).<Reference refidx="49"/> This was not confirmed by a Children's Oncology Group study of patients with intermediate-risk rhabdomyosarcoma.<Reference refidx="50"/> This relationship requires prospective study to determine the therapeutic implications of the observation.  </Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Metastases and regional lymph node involvement: </Strong>Children with metastatic disease at diagnosis have the
worst prognosis.  The prognostic significance of metastatic disease
is modified by tumor histology (embryonal  is more favorable than alveolar),  the site of metastatic disease, and the number of metastatic sites.<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="51"/><Reference refidx="52"/> 
Patients with metastatic genitourinary (nonbladder, nonprostate)
primary tumors have a more favorable outcome than do patients with
metastatic disease from primary tumors at other sites.<Reference refidx="53"/>   

<Para id="_617">Patients with otherwise localized disease but with proven regional lymph node
involvement have a worse prognosis than do patients without regional nodal
involvement.<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/></Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Resectability: </Strong>The extent of disease after the primary surgical procedure (i.e., the Surgical-pathologic Group, formerly called the Clinical Group) is also correlated with outcome.<Reference refidx="7"/>  In the IRS-III study, patients with localized, gross residual disease after
initial surgery (Surgical-pathologic Group III) had a 5-year survival rate of 
approximately 70%, compared with a more than 90% 5-year survival rate for
patients without residual tumor after surgery (Group I) and an
approximately 80% 5-year survival rate for patients with microscopic residual
tumor after surgery (Group II).<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="26"/> Regardless, outcome is primarily related to the use of multimodality therapy; all patients require chemotherapy and at least 85% also benefit from radiation therapy, with favorable outcome even for those patients with nonresectable disease.  In IRS-IV, the Group III patients with unresectable disease who were treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy had a 5-year FFS of about 75%.<Reference refidx="54"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Histopathologic subtype: </Strong>The alveolar subtype is more prevalent among patients with less favorable
clinical features (e.g., younger than 1 year or older than 10 years,
extremity primary tumors, and metastatic disease at diagnosis), and is generally associated with
a worse outcome than in similar patients with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.  In the IRS-I and IRS-II studies, the alveolar subtype was
associated with a less favorable outcome even in patients whose primary 
 tumor was completely resected (Group I).<Reference refidx="47"/>  A statistically  significant
difference in 5-year survival by histopathologic subtype (82% for embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma vs. 65% for alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma), was not noted
when 1,258 IRS-III and IRS-IV patients with rhabdomyosarcoma were analyzed.<Reference refidx="55"/>  In the IRS-III study, outcome for patients with Group I alveolar subtype tumors was similar to that for other patients with
Group I tumors, but the alveolar patients received more
intensive therapy.<Reference refidx="7"/>  <Para id="_495">Patients with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma who have regional lymph node involvement have significantly worse outcomes (5-year FFS, 43%) than patients who do not have regional lymph node involvement (5-year FFS, 73%).<Reference refidx="56"/></Para><Para id="_618">Anaplasia has been observed in 13% of cases of rhabdomyosarcoma and its presence may adversely influence clinical outcome in patients with intermediate-risk embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. However, anaplasia was not shown to be an independent prognostic variable in a multivariate analysis (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .081).<Reference refidx="57"/></Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Biological characteristics:</Strong> Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062792#_232" url="/types/soft-tissue-sarcoma/hp/rhabdomyosarcoma-treatment-pdq">Molecular Classification</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Response to therapy:</Strong> In a study of 94 patients with rhabdomyosarcoma who underwent preirradiation and postirradiation positron emission tomography (PET) imaging at a median of 55 days after the completion of radiation therapy, a negative postirradiation PET predicted improved local failure-free survival.<Reference refidx="58"/> This difference was most pronounced for patients who had a negative postirradiation PET and no evidence of residual disease on coregistered computed tomography.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_619">Adult patients with rhabdomyosarcoma have a high incidence of pleomorphic histology (19%). Pleomorphic histology is extremely rare in children and young adults with rhabdomyosarcoma. Adults also have a higher incidence of tumors in unfavorable sites than do children.<Reference refidx="40"/></Para><Para id="_590">Because treatment and prognosis depend, in part, on the histology and molecular genetics of the tumor,
it is necessary that the tumor tissue be reviewed by pathologists and cytogeneticists/molecular geneticists with
experience in the evaluation and diagnosis of tumors in children. 
Additionally, the diversity of primary sites, the distinctive surgical and
radiation therapy treatments for each primary site, and the subsequent 
site-specific rehabilitation underscore the importance of treating children
with rhabdomyosarcoma in medical centers with appropriate experience in all
therapeutic modalities.

Study Group (IRSG) studies, and treatment plans were designed on the basis of assignment of
patients to different treatment groups according to prognosis.  Several years ago, the IRSG merged with the National Wilms Tumor Study Group and two large cooperative pediatric cancer treatment groups to form the Children's Oncology Group (COG). New protocols for children with soft tissue sarcoma are developed by the Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee of the COG (COG-STS).

In most cases, this is not possible, and therefore, only an initial biopsy is performed. The majority of patients have Group III (gross residual) disease. After initial chemotherapy, Group III patients receive definitive RT for control of the primary tumor. Some patients with initially unresected tumors may undergo second-look surgery (delayed primary excision) to remove residual tumor.  This is most appropriate if the delayed excision is deemed feasible with acceptable functional/cosmetic outcome and if a modest reduction in radiation dose is expected to significantly reduce the risk of long-term adverse effects. RT is given to clinically suspicious lymph nodes (detected by palpation or imaging) unless the suspicious lymph nodes are biopsied and shown to be free of rhabdomyosarcoma.

Subsequent surgical resection is preferred over RT, which is used only after incomplete resection, documented regional lymph node involvement, or a poor clinical response to initial chemotherapy. This approach is designed to avoid major surgical procedures and long-term damaging effects from  RT. Conversely, the primary COG-STS objective has been to employ local therapy soon after the initial operation or biopsy (except in patients with metastatic disease), using RT for patients with residual disease. Event-free survival (EFS) is the target endpoint, attempting to avoid relapse and subsequent salvage therapy.<Reference refidx="3"/> The MMT Group approach led to an overall survival (OS) rate of 71% in the European MMT89 study, compared with an OS rate of 84% in the IRS-IV study. Similarly, EFS rates at 5 years were 57% in the MMT89 study versus 78% in the IRS-IV study. Differences in outcome were most striking for patients with extremity and head and neck nonparameningeal tumors.  Failure-free survival was lower for patients with bladder/prostate primary tumors who did not receive RT as part of their initial treatment, but there was no difference in OS between the two strategies for these patients.<Reference refidx="4"/> The overall impression is that survival for most patient subsets is superior with the use of early local therapy, including RT.
