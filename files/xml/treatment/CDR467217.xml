            complementary and alternative treatment for cancer?
</Question><Answer><Para id="_8">Most of the herbs in PC-SPES have been used in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449722">traditional Chinese medicine</GlossaryTermRef> (TCM) for many health problems, including <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046539">prostate</GlossaryTermRef> problems, for hundreds of years. A chemist in New York and a doctor/herbalist  in China worked together to create the mixture. In 1997, a company was formed to make PC-SPES and sell it in the United States without a prescription. Interest in PC-SPES grew, and researchers began looking at it. Tests found that some batches of  PC-SPES contained one or more of the following <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000348921">drugs</GlossaryTermRef>, which are not found in nature:</Para><ItemizedList id="_26" Style="bullet"><ListItem><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044873">DES</GlossaryTermRef>, a type of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046076">estrogen</GlossaryTermRef> made in a lab.</ListItem><ListItem><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045249">Warfarin</GlossaryTermRef> (Coumadin), a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044371">blood-thinner</GlossaryTermRef>. </ListItem><ListItem> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045223">Indomethacin</GlossaryTermRef>, a drug used to decrease <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044042">inflammation</GlossaryTermRef>.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_27"> Because these drugs are to be used only by prescription and could be harmful to some people, PC-SPES was taken off the market in 2002. </Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_9"><Question>What is the theory behind the claim that PC-SPES is useful in treating cancer?</Question><Answer><Para id="_30">In lab tests, each <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463714">herb</GlossaryTermRef> used in PC-SPES has been reported to help keep <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef>  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046476">cells</GlossaryTermRef> from growing or to help prevent cell damage that can lead to cancer and other diseases.</Para><Para id="_10">PC-SPES was reported to slow the growth of prostate cancer but did not <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000318813">cure</GlossaryTermRef> it. It is not known how PC-SPES works in the body. Some of the herbs in the mixture contain <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000330175">phytoestrogens</GlossaryTermRef>, which are estrogen-like substances found in plants. Estrogen can cause the
				<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046611">testicles</GlossaryTermRef> to stop making
				<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045581">testosterone</GlossaryTermRef>, which makes some prostate cancers grow.  Patients' <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044085">responses</GlossaryTermRef> to  PC-SPES were similar to responses to estrogen <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044737">therapy</GlossaryTermRef> using DES. The DES found in some batches of PC-SPES, however, may not have been enough to cause all of the estrogen-like effects that were seen in users of the mixture. There is some evidence that the mixture works in a different way than DES does, and that PC-SPES alone (without DES in it) may fight prostate cancer.</Para><Para id="_29">PC-SPES has also shown anticancer effects on prostate cancers that do not depend on testosterone  and on other types of cancer. This suggests that PC-SPES may have anticancer qualities  other than its estrogen-like effects.  </Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_11"><Question>How is PC-SPES administered?</Question><Answer><Para id="_12">PC-SPES is taken by mouth in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000455334">capsules</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_13"><Question>Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies  been conducted using    
	PC-SPES?
</Question><Answer><Para id="_31">Studies of PC-SPES in test tubes  and using rats showed that it might keep cancer cells from growing. These studies were done, however, before it became known that some batches of the product contained unlisted prescription medicines. Also, the product was not standardized (different batches of PC-SPES were found to contain different strengths of the herbal ingredients). For these reasons, the results of the lab tests and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454774">animal studies</GlossaryTermRef> are not considered to be good evidence. </Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_15"><Question>Have any  clinical trials (research studies with people) of PC-SPES been conducted?</Question><Answer><Para id="_16">Clinical trials of PC-SPES had begun before the product was taken off the market. In these trials, PC-SPES was reported to improve <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef>, reduce pain, and lower <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044867">PSA</GlossaryTermRef> (prostate specific antigen) levels in patients with prostate cancer. Rising PSA levels can be a sign that prostate cancer is growing. </Para><Para id="_37">After it was learned that some batches of PC-SPES contained prescription medicines, ongoing studies were stopped and previous study results came into question. The responses reported in the studies may have been caused by the prescription medicines that were in the PC-SPES, as well as by the herbal ingredients. Also, since different batches of PC-SPES contained different ingredients, the  studies cannot easily  be compared. </Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_17"><Question>Have any side effects or risks been reported from PC-SPES?</Question><Answer><Para id="_18">Common <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046580">side effects</GlossaryTermRef> were the same as those reported with estrogen therapy:</Para><ItemizedList id="_33" Style="bullet"><ListItem><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000304766">Breast</GlossaryTermRef> swelling and tenderness.</ListItem><ListItem>Loss of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000651212">sex drive</GlossaryTermRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000321376">Impotence</GlossaryTermRef> (inability to have an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000373933">erection</GlossaryTermRef>).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_34">There were other, less common, side effects:</Para><ItemizedList id="_35" Style="bullet"><ListItem><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000476017">Blood clots</GlossaryTermRef> in the legs.</ListItem><ListItem><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000306496">Diarrhea</GlossaryTermRef>.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_36">PC-SPES may also change the way drugs, including anticancer drugs, work in the body.

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_2"><Title>General CAM Information</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_3">Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also referred to as integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_4">Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_5">Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. </Para></SummarySection> 
  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_6"><Title>Evaluation of CAM Approaches</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_7">It is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute  and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_8">Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH)  in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.</Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_9"><ExternalRef xref="http://cam.cancer.gov/cam/best_case_intro.html">The NCI Best Case Series Program</ExternalRef>   which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.</Para></SummarySection>
