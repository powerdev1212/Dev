The existing body of work on family caregivers of patients with cancer focuses primarily on a caregiver’s adjustment during the acute survivorship phase, from the time of diagnosis to 2 years postdiagnosis.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_35">As open communication and diagnostic disclosure for patients have gained in popularity, studies have focused on the impact of truth-telling on patients, and guidelines for such communication have been developed.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/> Although caregivers are sometimes included in these studies, little attention has been paid to caregivers’ specific informational needs and preferences for diagnostic information or to caregivers’ readiness or willingness to integrate this new medical information. Yet a caregiver is expected to learn new illness-related terminology, enter the new treatment setting with the cancer patient, and participate actively in treatment decision making. For all of these reasons, caregivers experience a complex array of powerful emotions that may equal or surpass those experienced by the patient during diagnosis and treatment.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/></Para><SummarySection id="_33"><Title>At Diagnosis</Title><Para id="_34">Family caregivers in the United States are expected to take an active role in decision making related to treatment options, beginning during the diagnostic phase. The caregiver is expected to do the following:<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_36" Style="bullet"><ListItem>	Integrate new medical information.</ListItem><ListItem>	Learn new illness-related terminology.</ListItem><ListItem>	Enter a new treatment setting.</ListItem><ListItem>	Find the time to accompany the patient to medical appointments.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_37"><Title>During Hospitalization and Treatment</Title><Para id="_38">Caregivers play an important role in making decisions about treatment and care. The family often steps in as a patient's advocate and primary decision maker at the request of the patient. How well a caregiver fulfills that role may depend on his or her preexisting relationship with the patient and the level of agreement between caregiver and patient. Disagreements and conflicts can complicate decision making and affect treatment choices.<Reference refidx="9"/> In addition, disagreement within the family about the most appropriate treatment options for the patient can cause excessive stress for both patients and caregivers, resulting in diminished quality of life.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_39">The Cancer Communication Assessment Tool for Patients and Families (CCAT-PF) is an instrument that assesses congruence in patient-caregiver communication. The tool can be used on patients, caregivers, or both and identifies specific areas of conflict that may be amenable to intervention. In the initial validation study, higher CCAT-PF scores were significantly correlated with the following:<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_40" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Greater patient depression.</ListItem><ListItem>Higher perceived family conflict.</ListItem><ListItem>Lower patient and caregiver well-being.</ListItem><ListItem>Less expressiveness.</ListItem><ListItem>Lower perceived family cohesion.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_41">The CCAT-PF can be administered by any member of the oncology team.</Para><Para id="_42">During the active treatment phase, caregivers report difficulties in juggling the competing demands of providing emotional and tangible support to patients while meeting the ongoing obligations of home, work, and family. The demands of providing transportation, scheduling and making hospital visits, arranging for home care, and dealing with insurers may be physically and emotionally exhausting for both cancer patients and their caregivers.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_43"><Title>Planning the Transition Home</Title><Para id="_44">Transitions between care settings are particularly stressful for both cancer patients and their caregivers. The immediate posthospitalization period may be the most precarious for caregivers, filled with mounting concerns about managing patients at home while also attending to their own health.<Reference refidx="12"/> A study involving 518,240 elderly couples enrolled in Medicare found that the hospitalization of a spouse was associated with an increased risk of death for elderly caregivers.<Reference refidx="13"/> The cancer patient usually prefers to be at home, where he or she can resume a sense of normalcy in a familiar and comforting environment.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_45"><Title>Home Care</Title><Para id="_46">If the cancer patient is receiving home care, the caregiver is responsible for managing home care professionals, organizing necessary medical and food supplies, managing any medical emergencies that may arise, and generally navigating the health care system. In addition to assuming many of the patient’s domestic responsibilities, the family caregiver may have to forgo social activities and work duties to assume the primary caregiver tasks of providing companionship, accompanying the patient to medical appointments, and running personal errands.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_47"><Title>Surviving Beyond Treatment</Title><Para id="_48">Persistent psychological distress and role adjustment problems experienced by caregivers have been reported up to a year after patients have completed treatment for cancer, with levels of distress far higher than those found in healthy controls.<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/> Much of this distress is attributed to elevated fears of recurrence and sexual difficulties.<Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/> At 2 years postdiagnosis, however, studies do not indicate long-term psychological distress.<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/></Para><Para id="_49">Generally speaking, factors that may predict a caregiver’s poor adjustment over the long term include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_50" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Strain in the relationship between caregiver and patient.<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/></ListItem><ListItem>Negative communication patterns between caregiver and patient.<Reference refidx="20"/></ListItem><ListItem>Less social support.<Reference refidx="21"/></ListItem><ListItem>Role overload.<Reference refidx="22"/></ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_51"><Title>End of Life</Title><Para id="_52">Caregiver quality of life has been found to be influenced by the cancer patient’s stage of illness and goals of care. Caregivers of patients at the end of life have been shown to have significantly lower quality-of-life scores and health scores than do caregivers of patients who are in active/curative treatment.<Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/></Para><Para id="_53">The physical and emotional demands of caregiving reach their peak as the disease progresses to the terminal phase. The period during which patients enter hospice is often characterized by profound unrest and intense strain. In the context of recurrent illness, terminal illness, or the dying process, the caregiver must meet a new set of challenges in dealing with increasing functional limitations, increasing dependence of the patient, and greater symptom burden.<Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/> If treatment is prolonged, the capacity of caregivers to meet the daily needs of patients is severely strained.</Para><Para id="_54">Caregivers providing end-of-life care have been shown to experience increased emotional distress, regardless of the amount of care provided, when they are limited in their ability to participate in valued activities and interests.<Reference refidx="26"/> Research had suggested that caregivers of cancer patients were at risk of developing a variety of psychological and physical problems, including anxiety, depression, fatigue, reduced self-esteem, and somatic health problems.<Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/> A well-designed study examined the prevalence of psychosocial variables associated with anxiety and depression in 436 caregivers of cancer survivors at 6 and 12 months postsurvivorship. Outcomes show that anxiety and depression often coexist, and that while anxiety abated over time, the percentage of those who were depressed remained stable. Partners and caregivers of survivors with lung, hematological, or head and neck cancer showed the highest levels of anxiety and depression. High use of avoidant coping and interference in regular activities were associated with both anxiety and depression. This included lower emotional/informational support and lower positive social interaction. Additional variables associated with anxiety and depression at 12 months included higher unmet needs and more caregiver involvement in personal and medical tasks. Even at the 12-month postsurvivor diagnosis, almost one-third of participants reported anxiety. Understanding the variables associated with caregivers' anxiety and depression can lead to earlier identification, more specific assessment, earlier referral, and more tailored caregiver interventions.<Reference refidx="29"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] However, the landscape has changed since the development of hospice and palliative medicine as a medical specialty, the availability of specialist-level palliative care consultation teams, and the equal focus on the cancer patient and family caregiver as the unit of care.</Para><Para id="_55">Hospital palliative care programs have been shown to improve caregiver well-being, family satisfaction, and physical and psychological symptom management for patients and caregivers alike. In a retrospective study involving 524 caregivers, palliative care consultation was associated with higher scores in nine caregiver-related domains of care during the last month of life.<Reference refidx="30"/> These differences were attributable primarily to improvements in communication and emotional support.</Para><Para id="_56">Generally speaking, the hallmarks of palliative care that relate to caregivers include the following:<Reference refidx="31"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_57" Style="bullet"><ListItem>An interdisciplinary focus.</ListItem><ListItem>Concern for quality of life of both patients and family caregivers.</ListItem><ListItem>Involvement of caregivers in symptom management, communication, and medical decision making.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_58">While the oncologist and other team members cannot be expected to address the symptoms of psychological distress in family caregivers, it is nonetheless helpful to recognize and identify such symptoms so that caregivers can be referred to any services they may need.

A cross-sectional study was conducted in Taiwan to determine the frequency and difficulty of decisions encountered by bereaved caregivers of terminally ill patients who had died in one university hospital.<Reference refidx="4"/>  In Asian cultures, it is not uncommon for health care providers to refrain from telling the complete truth to patients, especially in the case of terminal disease, with the responsibility often left to family caregivers.

Ideally, a comprehensive caregiver assessment should be performed when the patient is first diagnosed with cancer, when the patient presents in the emergency department, and when a major transition is planned. In systems where caregivers are assessed, caregivers can be acknowledged by practitioners as valued members of the health care team. Caregiver assessment can identify family members most at risk for health and mental health difficulties so that additional services can be planned accordingly.<Reference refidx="18"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_137"><Title>Culture</Title><Para id="_138">Caregiver assessment needs to be multidimensional and reflect culturally competent practice.<Reference refidx="19"/> Studies have shown that cultural beliefs play a part in influencing family emotions and concerns in the cancer experience.</Para><Para id="_139">In a meta-analysis of 116 empirical studies, Asian American caregivers were found to provide more caregiving hours than white, African American, and Hispanic caregivers; to use lower levels of formal support services; and to have fewer financial resources, lower levels of education, and higher levels of depression than the other subgroups.<Reference refidx="19"/> These findings are important for the oncology team because caregivers with no outside help are more depressed than those who receive help. A study involving unmet needs and service barriers among Asian American caregivers found that caregivers refused outside help because they “felt too proud to accept it” or “didn’t want outsiders coming in”; other reported barriers included “bureaucracy too complex” or “can’t find qualified providers.”<Reference refidx="20"/></Para><Para id="_140">Access to care may be compromised by the family's reluctance to discuss the disease among themselves. Some Asian Americans believe that talking about death or dying is bad luck, which greatly complicates discussions about prognosis and informed consent.<Reference refidx="21"/> Keeping a cancer diagnosis secret from a patient and avoiding discussions of disease progression can add to a caregiver’s sense of burden and responsibility. Early in the initial assessment, cultural beliefs about illness and caregiver roles should be identified and discussed.</Para><Para id="_141">Studies show that Hispanic and African American patients and caregivers underutilize community health resources, including counseling and support groups, home care, residential care, and hospice services. There are many reasons for this underutilization. One important reason is that strong family ties may prevent minority caregivers from seeking help outside of the family unit.<Reference refidx="22"/> A study that compared African American, white, and Hispanic caregivers found that 75% of Hispanic patients and 60% of African American patients lived with the family of the primary caregiver. The minority families relied more on informal caregiving from friends and relatives and had larger social support networks than the white families. However, this increased sense of obligation to provide care for older family members was associated with more caregiving hours, greater resignation about caregiving, higher levels of caregiver strain, and a larger reduction in household income than that reported by white caregivers.<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/></Para><Para id="_142">Another study analyzed reports of employment loss due to caregiving. Results showed that African American and Hispanic caregivers were more likely than white caregivers to reduce their work hours to care for patients. In addition, minority caregivers were reluctant to use formal nursing home services for their loved ones. The decision to reduce work hours rather than place a relative in a nursing home was associated with increased psychological, social, and financial burden.<Reference refidx="24"/></Para><Para id="_143">Accepting the burden of caregiving may lead to depression in caregivers. Caregivers who have no outside help are more depressed than those who receive help from secondary informal caregivers or from formal resources. Despite reporting stress, many Hispanic and African American caregivers do not seek outside help, even when they are aware of support groups and other resources. This barrier to care may be a reluctance to share familial problems with outsiders. Other barriers include the following:<Reference refidx="25"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_144" Style="bullet"><ListItem>	Lack of availability of outside help.</ListItem><ListItem>	Lack of community awareness.</ListItem><ListItem>	Lack of trust in social service providers.</ListItem><ListItem>	Misperceptions of the role of hospice services.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_145">Because African Americans rely heavily on closely knit groups of friends and family, they are less inclined to welcome strangers such as home care workers into their networks.<Reference refidx="25"/></Para><Para id="_146">In addition, a prerequisite for obtaining hospice care is the presence of a primary caregiver in the home. Because African American family members often must work outside the home, no one is available to care for the patient, and the patient may thus be barred from hospice care. Members of the African American community may also be uncomfortable with the concept of palliative care, which seems to encourage the patient to give up and stop fighting.<Reference refidx="25"/> These cross-cultural issues are important in assessing caregiver needs and in designing clinical and educational programs to meet those needs.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_147"><Title>Caregiver Age and Health Status</Title><Para id="_148">Family caregivers often feel unprepared, have inadequate knowledge, and receive little guidance from the oncology team for providing care to the cancer patient.<Reference refidx="27"/> Older caregivers are especially vulnerable because they may present with comorbidities, they may be living on fixed incomes, and their available social support networks may have shrunk. In addition, older caregivers of cancer patients may neglect their own health needs, have less time to exercise, forget to take their own prescription medications, and become fatigued from interrupted sleep. It is therefore common for caregiving by older people to lead to poor physical health, depression, and even increased mortality.<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/></Para><Para id="_149">Younger caregivers must generally juggle work, their own family responsibilities, and sacrifices involving their social lives. Middle-aged caregivers typically worry about missed workdays, interruptions at work, taking leaves of absence, and reduced productivity.<Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="31"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_150"><Title>Socioeconomic Background</Title><Para id="_151">Substantial out-of-pocket costs involved in caregiving can create financial strain for the families of patients with cancer. Higher income can mitigate some of these effects because wealthier families are better able to purchase care and external support services, which can lower feelings of distress. On the other hand, low personal and household incomes and limited financial resources may also place families at risk for treatment compliance or treatment-related decisions that are made on the basis of income.<Reference refidx="32"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_152"><Title>The Family and Medical Leave Act</Title><Para id="_153">The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) was designed to give employees the option of taking time off from work for their own serious medical condition or that of a relative without losing their benefits or their jobs. Family members are entitled to a maximum of 12 weeks’ leave under the law; however, since its implementation, FMLA has been met with resistance from employers and underutilization by employees. In an exploratory study involving 45 caregivers of children with chronic illnesses, FMLA was least used by unmarried women with annual incomes lower than $35,000.<Reference refidx="33"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_154"><Title>Norms, Roles, and Expectations</Title><Para id="_155">The original theoretical models for understanding caregiver burden highlighted caregiver appraisal and role strain.<Reference refidx="34"/><Reference refidx="35"/> Multiple roles performed by caregivers of cancer patients can compete with each other in relation to caregivers’ physical and emotional resources.</Para><Para id="_156">Role strain theory has been used to explain caregiver burden in numerous studies. Results of a study of 457 middle-aged caregivers showed that the more social roles a caregiver performed, the more likely the caregiver was to experience stress and negative affect.<Reference refidx="36"/>  Employed caregivers who were also caring for children reported higher levels of stress; however, employed caregivers beneﬁted from the respite provided by work and from the support of employers and co-workers, which enabled them to replenish their psychological resources. Encouraging caregivers to maintain their roles as employees might therefore be helpful.</Para><Para id="_157">Focus has shifted to the treatment of caregiving as a dyadic phenomenon, based on the recognition that family caregiver roles are complex and overlapping.  By its nature, caregiving is fundamentally relational <Reference refidx="37"/> and often reciprocal.<Reference refidx="38"/><Reference refidx="39"/> To be effective, any assessment should take into account not only what the care recipient requires but also what the caregiver is able and willing to provide.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="18797213">Levine C: Nursing and social work leadership.

However, these interventions are expensive and may prove too time-consuming for working or highly distressed caregivers.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_177"><Title>Home Care Services for the Cancer Patient</Title><Para id="_178">Home care services provided for the cancer patient generally include caregiver support as part of the plan of care. Caregivers report high rates of satisfaction with such services and describe them as useful.<Reference refidx="15"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] At the same time, however, studies continue to show high levels of psychological morbidity and unmet needs among caregivers of cancer patients using home care services, suggesting that generic supportive nursing care does not fully meet caregiver needs.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para><Para id="_179">One group of investigators studied whether specialized oncology home care services provided to lung cancer patients influenced bereavement and psychological distress among survivors.<Reference refidx="16"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] Participants were randomly assigned to an oncology home care group, a standard home care group, or an office care control group.  Spouses of patients in the oncology home care group had significantly lower psychological distress than did spouses of patients in either of the other groups.<Reference refidx="16"/> These findings have been corroborated by others.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_180"><Title>Hospice Care for the Cancer Patient</Title><Para id="_181">Family caregivers of home-based palliative care patients report the need for coaching in practical nursing skills and more access to professional advice to increase their self-confidence and ability to perform the practical aspects of home-based care.<Reference refidx="17"/> In addition, caregivers assisting patients in the final stages of life experience as much distress as patients do, if not more. A meta-analysis of psychological distress among cancer patients and family caregivers found that both members of the dyad experienced similar levels of distress.<Reference refidx="18"/> For these reasons, there is a strong correlation between quality-of-life scores for patients and their caregivers in hospice home care programs; caregivers continue to report high rates of burden.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_182"><Title>Psychoeducation</Title><Para id="_183">Psychoeducational programs provide caregivers of cancer patients with a variety of skills, resources, and problem-solving strategies to help them cope with caregiving. For example, the problem-solving model summarized by the acronym COPE (creativity, optimism, planning, and expert information) is designed to maximize a caregiver’s effectiveness, sense of efficacy, and satisfaction.<Reference refidx="23"/> Caregivers are encouraged to develop creative solutions to challenging situations. The COPE problem-solving model:</Para><ItemizedList id="_184" Style="bullet"><ListItem>	Addresses the emotional aspect of problem-solving, combining optimism with realism.</ListItem><ListItem>	Helps caregivers develop specific plans to meet their individual situations.</ListItem><ListItem>	Teaches caregivers the rationales for what they do.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_185">The authors of the COPE study contend that their model moderates caregiver stress through empowerment and training.<Reference refidx="23"/></Para><Para id="_186">Skills training for caregivers has proven effective in improving their quality of life, reducing the burden associated with symptom management, and in strengthening caregiving tasks. Such programs are effective for caregivers of patients at all stages of cancer, including end-of-life care and hospice.<Reference refidx="22"/> The most effective skills training programs tend to be nursing intervention programs, which combine guidance, support, and nursing home visits.<Reference refidx="6"/> Nurse-led transition coaching programs prepare patients and caregivers for the next level of care, teach communication skills, and follow patients to the home. In addition, the nurses initiate phone calls at 2, 7, and 14 days after discharge, thereby providing continuity of care through a single point of contact.<Reference refidx="24"/></Para><Para id="_187">The effectiveness of psychoeducational programs for caregivers of cancer patients has been mixed.  For example, a 6-week problem-solving intervention with spouses of cancer patients was successful at reducing depression; however, there were no effects on coping, social support, or psychological well-being.<Reference refidx="25"/> In another study, 237 cancer patient/caregiver dyads were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a conventional care group or a 20-week experimental group. The focus of the intervention was improving the caregiver’s ability in symptom management and reducing their distress. Although the intervention improved caregivers’ symptom management abilities, it was not effective in decreasing their depression.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para><Para id="_188">It is possible that interventions with multiple components are more effective in assisting caregivers. For example, the Family Caregiver Cancer Education Program targets education about symptom management along with skill-building in communication, managing roles and relationships, managing finances, and maintaining self-care.<Reference refidx="27"/> Caregivers’ sense of confidence and being well informed increased after participation in the program, while perceptions of their own health improved over time.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_189"><Title>The Family Meeting</Title><Para id="_190">Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000681705#_74" url="/about-cancer/coping/family-friends/family-caregivers-hp-pdq">Convening a Family Meeting</SummaryRef> section in the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000681705#_7" url="/about-cancer/coping/family-friends/family-caregivers-hp-pdq">Physicians Interacting With Family Caregivers</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_191"><Title>Rehabilitation for the Caregiver</Title><Para id="_192">Although the subject of caregiver burden is well represented in the literature, one comprehensive review found a strikingly limited number of studies addressing interventions for caregiver strain and burden in oncology.<Reference refidx="28"/> The extensive literature search yielded only 20 intervention studies, with only 8 studies that specifically cited outcome measures for strain and burden. Two systematic reviews <Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="27"/> exclusively examined studies of caregivers in oncology or palliative care populations. However, most study designs were qualitative, descriptive, cross-sectional, or nonexperimental designs; therefore, many of the proposed interventions for caregivers (e.g., competence, support, respite, or adult day care) are those whose effectiveness cannot be established until further evidence is obtained with randomized clinical trials.</Para><Para id="_193">Although some of the interventions studied had positive psychosocial outcomes, the studies could not document a reduction in caregiver burden. Therefore, those particular strategies require further testing before their effectiveness in reducing caregiver burden can be established.<Reference refidx="28"/></Para><Para id="_194">Few intervention studies have demonstrated efficacy in improving the quality of life of caregivers from the study entry point. Instead, most intervention studies have demonstrated efficacy in improving knowledge of and skills in caregiving. For example, interventions designed to educate caregivers about how to seek out medical information, identify psychosocial resources, or manage symptoms have helped improve caregivers’ knowledge, confidence, and mood. Similarly, interventions designed to help caregivers develop problem-solving skills (e.g., coping with cancer) have demonstrated effectiveness in increasing caregiver self-efficacy in managing stress and in reducing psychological distress.<Reference refidx="29"/></Para><Para id="_202">In one study, the psychosocial needs of not only the caregiver but also other family members and people close to the dying patient—all defined in this study as "secondary survivors"—were examined.  A qualitative assessment of the needs of the secondary survivors, which occurred after 8 weeks of group psychoeducational grief intervention, revealed a sense of powerlessness and isolation in these individuals.  Also, support was identified as a need extending beyond the traditional needs associated with the care of dying patients.  The authors concluded that intervention by social workers directed toward the needs of  secondary survivors may be helpful.<Reference refidx="30"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="15008126">Hudson PL, Aranda S, Kristjanson LJ: Meeting the supportive needs of family caregivers in palliative care: challenges for health professionals.
