most common malignancy of the endocrine system.<Reference refidx="2"/>  Differentiated tumors
(papillary or follicular) are highly treatable and usually curable.  Poorly differentiated tumors (medullary or anaplastic) are much less common, are
aggressive, metastasize early, and have a much poorer prognosis.  Thyroid
cancer affects women more often than men and usually occurs in
people between the ages of 25 and 65 years.  The incidence of this malignancy has
been increasing over the last decade.  Thyroid cancer commonly presents
as a cold nodule.  The overall incidence of cancer in a cold nodule is 12% to
15%, but it is higher in people younger than 40 years and in people with calcifications present on preoperative ultrasonography.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_313"><Title>Risk Factors</Title><Para id="_314">Patients with a history of radiation administered in infancy and childhood for
benign conditions of the head and neck, such as enlarged thymus, acne, or
tonsillar or adenoidal enlargement, have an increased risk of cancer as well as
other abnormalities of the thyroid gland.  In this group of patients,
malignancies of the thyroid gland first appear beginning as early as 5 years
following radiation and may appear 20 or more years later.<Reference refidx="5"/> Radiation exposure as a consequence of nuclear fallout has also been associated with a high risk of thyroid cancer, especially in children.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> Other risk
factors for the development of thyroid cancer include the following:<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_315" Style="bullet"><ListItem>A history of goiter.</ListItem><ListItem>Family history of thyroid disease.</ListItem><ListItem>Female gender.</ListItem><ListItem>Asian race.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_316"><Title>Prognostic Factors</Title><Para id="_317">The prognosis for differentiated
carcinoma is better for patients younger than 40 years without
extracapsular extension or vascular invasion.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/>  Age appears to be the
single most important prognostic factor.<Reference refidx="12"/>  The prognostic significance of lymph node status is controversial.  One
retrospective surgical series of 931 previously untreated patients with
differentiated thyroid cancer found that female gender, multifocality, and
regional node involvement are favorable prognostic factors.<Reference refidx="15"/>  Adverse factors
included age older than 45 years, follicular histology, primary tumor   larger than 4
cm (T2–T3), extrathyroid extension (T4), and distant metastases.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/> 
Other studies, however, have shown that regional lymph node involvement had no
effect <Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/> or even an adverse effect on survival.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="19"/>  Use of sentinel lymph node biopsy may aid in identifying patients with occult metastases who might benefit from central neck dissection.<Reference refidx="20"/></Para><SummarySection id="_387"><Title>Risk factors and survivorship</Title><Para id="_318">Diffuse, intense
immunostaining for vascular endothelial growth factor in patients with
papillary cancer has been associated with a high rate of local recurrence and
distant metastases.<Reference refidx="21"/>  An elevated serum thyroglobulin level correlates
strongly with recurrent tumor when found in patients with differentiated
thyroid cancer during postoperative evaluations.<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/>  Serum thyroglobulin
levels are most sensitive when patients are hypothyroid and have elevated serum
thyroid-stimulating hormone levels.<Reference refidx="24"/>  Expression of the tumor suppressor
gene <GeneName>p53</GeneName> has also been associated with an adverse prognosis for patients with
thyroid cancer.<Reference refidx="25"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_388"><Title>Low-risk factors</Title><Para id="_319">Patients considered  at low risk by the age, metastases, extent, and size
(AMES) risk criteria include women younger than 50 years and men younger
than 40 years without evidence of distant metastases.  Also included in
the low-risk group are older patients with primary tumors    smaller than 5
cm and papillary cancer without evidence of gross extrathyroid
invasion or follicular cancer without either major capsular invasion or blood
vessel invasion.<Reference refidx="11"/>  Using these criteria, a retrospective study of 1,019
patients showed that the 20-year survival rate is 98% for low-risk patients and
50% for high-risk patients.<Reference refidx="11"/> The 10-year overall relative survival rates for patients in the United States are  93% for papillary cancer, 85% for follicular cancer, 75% for medullary cancer, and 14% for undifferentiated/anaplastic cancer.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_4">
The
thyroid gland may occasionally be the site of other primary tumors, including
sarcomas, lymphomas, epidermoid carcinomas, and teratomas and may be the site
of metastasis from other cancers, particularly of the lung, breast, and kidney.

by blood vessel invasion.  Medullary thyroid cancer occurs in two  forms, 
sporadic and familial.  In the sporadic form, the tumor is usually unilateral. 
In the familial form, the tumor is almost always bilateral.  In addition, the
familial form may be associated with benign or malignant tumors of other
endocrine organs, commonly referred to as the multiple endocrine neoplasia
syndromes (MEN 2A or MEN 2B).
</Para><Para id="_68">In these syndromes, there is an association with pheochromocytoma of the adrenal
gland and parathyroid hyperplasia.  Medullary carcinoma usually secretes
calcitonin, a hormonal marker for the tumor, and may be detectable in blood
even when the tumor is clinically occult.  Metastases to regional lymph nodes
are found in about 50% of cases.  Prognosis depends on extent of disease at
presentation, presence or absence of regional lymph node metastases, and
completeness of the surgical resection.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_69">Family members should be screened for calcitonin elevation to identify

mutation is the optimal approach in evaluating MEN 2A.  All patients with
medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (whether familial or sporadic) should be
tested for <GeneName>RET</GeneName>    mutations, and, if they are positive, family members should
