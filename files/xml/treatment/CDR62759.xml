As a result, most of the cervical cancer cases are diagnosed in women who live in regions with inadequate screening protocols.</Para><SummarySection id="_284"><Title>Incidence and Mortality</Title><Para id="_207">Estimated new cases and deaths from cervical (uterine cervix) cancer in the United States in 2015:<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_208" Style="bullet"><ListItem>New cases: 12,900.</ListItem><ListItem>Deaths: 4,100.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_391"><Title>Anatomy</Title><Para id="_668">The uterine cervix is contiguous with the uterine body,  and it acts as the opening to the body of the uterus. The uterine cervix is a cylindrical, fibrous organ that is an average of 3 to 4 cm in length.  The portio of the cervix is the part of the cervix that is visible on vaginal inspection.  The opening of the cervix is termed the external os.  The os is the beginning of the endocervical canal, which forms the inner aspect of the cervix.  At the upper aspect of the endocervical canal is the internal os, a narrowing of the endocervical canal.  The narrowing marks the transition from the cervix to the uterine body.  The endocervical canal beyond the internal os is termed the endometrial canal.</Para><Para id="_669">The cervix is lined by two types of epithelial cells: squamous cells at the outer aspect, and columnar, glandular cells along the inner canal.   The transition between squamous cells and columnar cells is an area termed the squamo-columnar junction.  Most of precancerous and cancerous changes arise in this zone. </Para><MediaLink ref="CDR0000609921" type="image/jpeg" alt="Anatomy of the female reproductive system; drawing shows the uterus, myometrium (muscular outer layer of the uterus), endometrium (inner lining of the uterus), ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina." language="en" thumb="Yes" id="_395" size="half"/></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_532"><Title>Pathogenesis</Title><Para id="_533">Cervical carcinoma has its origins at the squamous-columnar junction;  it can involve the outer squamous cells, the inner glandular cells, or both.  The precursor lesion is
dysplasia: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or adenocarcinoma <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis>,
which can subsequently become invasive cancer.  This process can be quite slow. 
Longitudinal studies have shown that in patients with untreated <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis>
cervical cancer, 30% to 70% will develop invasive carcinoma over a period of 10
to 12 years.  However, in about 10% of patients, lesions can progress from <Emphasis>in
situ</Emphasis> to invasive in a period of  less than  1 year.  As it becomes invasive, the
tumor breaks through the basement membrane and invades the cervical stroma. 
Extension of the tumor in the cervix may ultimately manifest as ulceration,
exophytic tumor, or extensive infiltration of underlying tissue, including
the bladder or rectum.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_392"><Title>Risk Factors</Title><SummarySection id="_534"><Title>Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection</Title><Para id="_670">HPV infection is a necessary step in the development of virtually all precancerous and cancerous lesions.  Epidemiologic studies convincingly demonstrate that the major risk factor for development of preinvasive or invasive carcinoma of the cervix is HPV infection, far outweighing other known risk factors.</Para><Para id="_535">More than 6 million
women in the United States are estimated to be infected with  HPV. Transient HPV infection is common, particularly in young women,<Reference refidx="3"/> while cervical cancer is rare.  The persistence of an HPV infection leads to increased risk of developing  precancerous and cancerous lesions.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_537">The strain of HPV infection is also important in conferring risk.  There are multiple subtypes of HPV that  infect humans; of these, subtypes 16 and 18 have been most closely associated with high-grade dysplasia and cancer.  Studies  suggest that acute infection with HPV types 16 and
18 conferred an 11-fold to 16.9-fold risk of rapid development of high-grade CIN.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> Further studies have shown that infection with either HPV 16 or 18 is more predictive than cytologic screening of high-grade CIN or greater disease, and that the predictive ability is seen for up to 18 years after the initial test.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_671">There are two commercially available vaccines that target anogenital-related strains of HPV.  The vaccines are directed towards HPV-naïve girls and young women, and although penetration of the vaccine has been moderate, significant decreases in HPV-related diseases have been documented.<Reference refidx="12"/>   (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062762" url="/types/cervical/hp/cervical-prevention-pdq">Cervical Cancer Prevention</SummaryRef> for more information.)</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_538"><Title>Other risk factors</Title><Para id="_539">Other risk factors for cervical cancer include the following:<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_540" Style="bullet">

However, molecular techniques for the identification of HPV DNA are highly sensitive and specific.  Current screening options include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_785" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Cytology alone.</ListItem><ListItem>Cytology and HPV testing.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_786">HPV testing is suggested when it is likely to successfully triage patients into low- and high-risk groups for a high-grade dysplasia or greater lesion.</Para><Para id="_543">HPV DNA tests are unlikely to separate patients with low-grade squamous

A study of 642 women found that 83% had one  or more tumorigenic HPV types
when cervical cytologic specimens were assayed by a sensitive (hybrid capture)
technique.<Reference refidx="15"/>  The authors of the study and of an accompanying editorial
concluded that using HPV DNA testing in this setting does not add sufficient
information to justify its cost.<Reference refidx="15"/>  </Para><Para id="_620">  HPV DNA testing has proven
useful in triaging patients with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance to colposcopy and has been integrated into current screening guidelines.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/></Para><Para id="_544">Other studies show that patients with low-risk cytology and high-risk HPV infection
with types 16, 18, and 31 are more likely to have CIN or microinvasive histopathology on biopsy.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/>  One
method has also shown that integration of HPV types 16 and 18 into the genome,
leading to transcription of  viral and cellular messages, may predict
patients who are at greater risk for high-grade dysplasia and invasive
cancer.<Reference refidx="21"/></Para><Para id="_674">For women older than 30 years who are more likely to have persistent HPV infection, HPV typing can successfully triage women into high- and low-risk groups for CIN 3 or worse disease.  In this age group, HPV DNA testing is more effective than cytology alone in predicting the risk of developing CIN 3 or worse.<Reference refidx="22"/>  Other studies have shown the effectiveness of a primary HPV DNA–screening strategy with cytology triage over  the previously used cytology-based screening algorithms.<Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_285"><Title>Prognostic Factors</Title><Para id="_3">The
prognosis for patients with cervical cancer is markedly affected by the extent of disease at the
time of diagnosis. More than 90% of cervical cancer cases
can be detected early through the use of the Pap test and HPV testing.<Reference refidx="25"/> Pap and HPV testing are not performed on approximately 33% of eligible women, which results in a higher-than-expected death rate. 
</Para><SummarySection id="_545"><Title>Clinical stage</Title><Para id="_546">Clinical stage as a prognostic factor is supplemented by several gross and microscopic pathologic findings in surgically treated patients. </Para><Para id="_548">Evidence (clinical stage and other findings):</Para><Para id="_622">In a large,
surgicopathologic staging study of patients with clinical stage IB disease
reported by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) (GOG-49), the factors that most prominently predicted
 for lymph node metastases and a decrease in disease-free
survival were capillary-lymphatic space involvement by tumor, increasing tumor
size, and increasing depth of stromal invasion, with the latter being the most
important and reproducible.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/></Para><Para id="_623">In a study of 1,028 patients treated with
radical surgery, survival rates correlated more consistently with tumor volume
(as determined by precise volumetry of the tumor) than with clinical or histologic
stage.<Reference refidx="28"/></Para><Para id="_624">A multivariate analysis of prognostic variables in 626 patients with
locally advanced disease (primarily stages II, III, and IV) studied by the GOG 
identified the following variables that were significant for progression-free interval and
survival:<Reference refidx="29"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_625" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Periaortic and pelvic lymph node status.</ListItem><ListItem>Tumor size.</ListItem><ListItem>Patient age.</ListItem><ListItem>Performance status.</ListItem><ListItem>Bilateral disease.</ListItem><ListItem>Clinical stage.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_626">The study confirmed the overriding importance of positive periaortic
nodes and suggested further evaluation of these nodes in locally advanced
cervical cancer. The status of the pelvic nodes was important only if the
periaortic nodes were negative.  This was also true for tumor size.</Para><Para id="_627">It is controversial whether
adenocarcinoma of the cervix carries a significantly worse prognosis than
squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.<Reference refidx="30"/>  Several population-based and retrospective studies show a worse outcome for patients with adenocarcinoma, with an increase in distant metastasis noted, when compared with  those with squamous histology.<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/> Reports
conflict about  the effect of adenosquamous cell type on outcome.<Reference refidx="35"/><Reference refidx="36"/>  One report
showed that approximately 25% of apparent squamous tumors have
demonstrable mucin production and behave more aggressively than their pure
squamous counterparts, suggesting that any adenomatous differentiation may
confer a negative prognosis.<Reference refidx="37"/>  </Para><Para id="_628">In a large
series of cervical cancer patients treated by radiation therapy, the incidence
of distant metastases (most frequently to the lung, abdominal cavity, liver, and
gastrointestinal tract) was shown to increase  as the stage of disease
increased, from 3% in stage IA to 75% in stage IVA.<Reference refidx="38"/>  A multivariate analysis of factors
influencing the incidence of distant metastases showed stage, endometrial
extension of tumor, and pelvic tumor control to be significant indicators of
distant dissemination.<Reference refidx="38"/></Para><Para id="_552">GOG studies have indicated that prognostic factors vary depending on whether clinical or surgical staging are utilized and with different treatments. Delay in radiation delivery completion is associated with poorer progression-free survival when clinical staging is used. To-date, stage, tumor grade, race, and age  are uncertain  prognostic factors in studies utilizing chemoradiation.<Reference refidx="39"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_553"><Title>Other prognostic factors</Title><Para id="_554">Other prognostic factors that may affect outcome include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_555" Style="bullet" Compact="No">

function of the extent and invasiveness of the local lesion.  While cancer of
the cervix generally progresses in an orderly manner, occasionally a small
tumor with distant metastasis is seen.  For this reason, patients must be
carefully evaluated for metastatic disease.

survival with routine surgical staging; the staging is usually performed only as

curable disease may be indicated in select cases when a nonsurgical search for
metastatic disease is negative.  If abnormal nodes are detected by computed tomography (CT) scan or
lymphangiography, fine-needle aspiration should be negative before a surgical

Patients should undergo biopsy as needed and  imaging  to establish the extent of disease  to make the most informed choices.   The most appropriate imaging modality in pregnancy is magnetic resonance imaging, when indicated.   </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_808"><Title>Treatment for Stage I Disease</Title><Para id="_809">Pregnancy does not alter the course of cervical cancer.  As a result, in certain cases, patients may elect to postpone treatment until its effects on the pregnancy are minimized.  This may be considered for patients with the more common, and less aggressive histologic subtypes: squamous, adenocarcinoma, and adenosquamous.  Patients with high-risk subtypes, such as small cell or neuroendocrine tumors, should be counseled toward immediate treatment despite the effects on the fetus, given their risk of progression.</Para><Para id="_810">Patients with early stage (IA) disease may safely undergo fertility-sparing treatments including cervical conization or radical trachelectomy, as indicated.  The optimal timing for this procedure is in the second trimester, before viability.  Some authors have suggested waiting until the completion of a pregnancy to initiate treatment.<Reference refidx="1"/>  For patients with IA2 and IB disease such a delay may also be safe, but because of  a risk of lymphatic spread, assessment of lymph-node status should first be ascertained.  The status  is best determined surgically via a laparoscopic or open lymph-node dissection, which can be safely performed up to approximately 20 weeks of pregnancy.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/> In patients without lymphatic spread, waiting for fetal viability to initiate treatment is an option.  Patients with positive lymph nodes should be counseled toward immediate treatment.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_719"><Title>Treatment for Stages II, III, and IV Disease</Title><Para id="_720">For patients with stage II or greater disease, waiting for viability is generally not acceptable.<Reference refidx="4"/> The standard of care is curative intent chemotherapy and radiation therapy.  This treatment is toxic to the fetus and without ovarian transposition will render the ovaries nonfunctional after treatment.  Evacuation of the fetus should be performed before the initiation of radiation.  When this is not possible, the radiation will generally cause a spontaneous abortion 3 to 5 weeks after initiating treatment.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_721"><Title>Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy</Title><Para id="_722">Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been offered to patients with locally advanced disease as a way to initiate treatment while maintaining the pregnancy.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Most chemotherapy agents can be initiated safely in the second trimester of pregnancy and beyond;  mild growth restriction of the fetus is the most common side effect. Restriction of growth  has been reported in a relatively small number of patients, and data is lacking on long-term outcomes for these women; as a result, this strategy should be considered with caution.   Most of the patients in the reports underwent standard treatment (either surgery or radiation) after completion of the pregnancy.  </Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="22325661">Morice P, Uzan C, Gouy S, et al.: Gynaecological cancers in pregnancy.
