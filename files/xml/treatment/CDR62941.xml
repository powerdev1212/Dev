epithelial ovarian cancers.  Nearly 75% of these tumors are stage I at the time of
diagnosis.  These tumors must be recognized because their prognosis and
treatment is clearly different from the frankly malignant invasive carcinomas.</Para><Para id="_17">A review of 22 series (953 patients) with a mean follow-up of 7 years revealed
a survival rate of 92% for patients with advanced-stage tumors, if patients with so-called
invasive implants were excluded.  The cause of death was determined to be
benign complications of disease (e.g., small bowel obstruction), complications
of therapy, and only rarely (0.7%), malignant transformation.<Reference refidx="1"/>  In one
series, the 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year survival rates of patients with low
malignant potential tumors (all stages), as demonstrated by clinical life table
analysis, were 97%, 95%, 92%, and 89%, respectively.<Reference refidx="2"/>  In this series, mortality was stage
dependent:  0.7%, 4.2%, and 26.8% of patients with stages I, II, and III,
respectively, died of disease.<Reference refidx="2"/>   Another large study showed early stage, serous
histology, and younger age to be associated with a more favorable prognosis.<Reference refidx="3"/> 
In contrast to the excellent survival rates for early-stage disease reported above, the Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d’Obstetrique Annual Report (#21) included 529 patients with stage I tumors with a 5-year actuarial survival rate of 89.1%.  Similarly, good survival was found in a
large prospective study.<Reference refidx="4"/>  Nonetheless, these survival rates are clearly in
contrast with the 30% survival rate for invasive tumors (all stages).</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_60"><Title>Endometrioid tumor</Title><Para id="_2">  The less
common endometrioid tumor of low malignant potential should not be regarded as
malignant because  it seldom, if ever, metastasizes.  Malignant transformation
can, however, occur and may be associated with a similar tumor outside of the
ovary; such tumors are the result of either a second primary or rupture of the
primary endometrial tumor.<Reference refidx="5"/>

not defined, in a study, 7 of 27 patients with presumed localized disease were
upstaged following complete surgical staging.<Reference refidx="1"/>  In two other studies, 16%

are free of  tumor.<Reference refidx="4"/>  In a large series, the relapse rate was higher with
