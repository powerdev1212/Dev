A small amount of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046550">radioactive</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044033">glucose</GlossaryTermRef> (sugar) is injected into a vein.  The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body.  Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. A PET scan and CT scan may be done at the same time.

		  <ListItem><Strong>Abdominal <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046157">ultrasound</GlossaryTermRef></Strong>: An ultrasound exam used to make pictures of the inside of the abdomen. The <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000367430">ultrasound transducer</GlossaryTermRef> is pressed against the skin of the abdomen and directs high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) into the abdomen. The sound waves bounce off the internal tissues and  organs and make echoes.  The transducer receives the echoes and sends them to a computer, which uses the echoes to make pictures called <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046587">sonograms</GlossaryTermRef>.

An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000572035">lens</GlossaryTermRef> for viewing.  A probe at the end of the endoscope   is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.  The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.  This procedure is also called endosonography.</ListItem> 
		   
		  <ListItem><Strong><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046429">Endoscopic
			 retrograde cholangiopancreatography</GlossaryTermRef> (ERCP)</Strong>: A procedure used to x-ray the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046441">ducts</GlossaryTermRef> (tubes) that carry <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046508">bile</GlossaryTermRef> from the liver to the gallbladder and from the gallbladder to the small intestine.  Sometimes pancreatic cancer causes these ducts to narrow and block or slow the flow of bile, causing jaundice.  An endoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is passed through the mouth, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046408">esophagus</GlossaryTermRef>, and stomach into the first part of the small intestine.  A <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045637">catheter</GlossaryTermRef> (a smaller tube) is then inserted through the endoscope into the pancreatic ducts.  A <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000409764">dye</GlossaryTermRef> is injected through the catheter into the ducts and an x-ray is taken.  If the ducts are blocked by a tumor, a fine tube may be inserted into the duct to unblock it.  This tube (or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044903">stent</GlossaryTermRef>) may be left in place to keep the duct open.  Tissue samples may also be taken.</ListItem> 
		  <ListItem><Strong><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046238">Percutaneous
			 transhepatic cholangiography</GlossaryTermRef> (PTC)</Strong>: A procedure used to x-ray the liver and bile ducts.  A thin needle is inserted through the skin below the ribs and into the liver.  Dye is injected into the liver or bile ducts and an x-ray is taken.  If a blockage is found, a thin, flexible tube called a stent is sometimes left in the liver to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000407759">drain</GlossaryTermRef> bile into the small intestine or a collection bag outside the body. This test is done only if <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046424">ERCP</GlossaryTermRef> cannot be
			 done.</ListItem>

Small <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046353">incisions</GlossaryTermRef> (cuts) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044360">laparoscope</GlossaryTermRef> (a thin, lighted tube) is inserted into one of the incisions. The laparoscope may have an ultrasound probe at the end in order to bounce high-energy sound waves off internal organs, such as the pancreas. This is called laparoscopic ultrasound. Other instruments may be inserted through the same or other incisions to perform procedures such as taking tissue samples from the pancreas or a sample of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044669">fluid</GlossaryTermRef>     from the abdomen to check for cancer.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Biopsy</Strong>: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000638184">microscope</GlossaryTermRef> by a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046244">pathologist</GlossaryTermRef> to check for signs of cancer. There are several ways to do a biopsy for pancreatic cancer.
			 A <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045691">fine needle</GlossaryTermRef> or a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000641799">core needle</GlossaryTermRef> may be inserted into the pancreas during an x-ray or

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/espanol/recursos/pdq">Spanish</ExternalRef>.</Para><Para id="_AboutThis_4">PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_AboutThis_5"><Title>Purpose of This Summary</Title><Para id="_AboutThis_6">This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of pancreatic cancer.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_AboutThis_7"><Title>Reviewers and Updates</Title><Para id="_AboutThis_8">Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Date Last Modified") is the date of the most recent change.
</Para><Para id="_AboutThis_9">The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/adult-treatment-board">PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board</ExternalRef>.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_AboutThis_10"><Title>Clinical Trial Information</Title><Para id="_AboutThis_11">A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
</Para><Para id="_AboutThis_12">Clinical trials are listed in PDQ and can be found online at <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials">NCI's Web site</ExternalRef>. Many cancer doctors who take part in clinical trials are also listed in PDQ. For more information, call the Cancer Information Service 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
