Nineteen patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045367">stage III</GlossaryTermRef> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045144">stage IV</GlossaryTermRef> disease were included in the survival arm; six of these patients were treated with conventional therapy (radiation therapy alone or chemotherapy alone) in addition to Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup, and 13 were treated with conventional therapy (radiation therapy alone, chemotherapy alone, surgery plus radiation therapy, or chemotherapy plus radiation therapy) (12 patients) or best <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046609">supportive care</GlossaryTermRef> (one patient) but not Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup.</Para><Para id="_42">The intended duration of Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup treatment for all patients who received the mixture was 24 months. The intended daily <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044664">dose</GlossaryTermRef> was 30 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000373014">g</GlossaryTermRef> of freeze-dried powder (i.e., DSV; refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000285728#_7" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/suns-soup-pdq">General Information</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information), mixed with water or other soup. Changes in body weight and changes in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044156">Karnofsky Performance Status</GlossaryTermRef>  (KPS) were measured in both arms of the trial. <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000655249">Median survival</GlossaryTermRef> time was the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044163">primary endpoint</GlossaryTermRef> in the survival arm.</Para><Para id="_43">In the toxicity arm, all five patients either gained weight or had no change in weight, which was measured twice, i.e., at study entry and 4 to 12 months later. The KPS score, which was also measured twice (at study entry and 3 months later), improved for four of the five patients and remained stable for the fifth. All five individuals were reported to be alive and well 24 months after diagnosis, and none developed a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045862">recurrent tumor</GlossaryTermRef> during follow-up. The actual duration of Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup treatment for these patients ranged from more than 17 months to more than 24 months. From these data, the researchers concluded that Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup was safe, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044509">nontoxic</GlossaryTermRef>, and well tolerated.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_44">In the survival arm, the average duration of Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup treatment was 7.3 months (range, 4–17 months). The median survival time from diagnosis for the six patients who <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044100">ingested</GlossaryTermRef> Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup was 15.5 months (range, 8 to more than 24 months), compared with a median survival time from diagnosis of 4 months (range, 1–12 months) for the 13 patients in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044149">control group</GlossaryTermRef>. This difference in median survival time was reported to be <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044167">statistically significant</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_45">As in 
the toxicity arm, body weight and KPS were measured twice in the survival arm.  Body-weight measurements were made at study entry and at an average of 4.8 months later (range, 3–7 months) for the six patients in the Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup treatment group. Among the 13 patients in the control group, nine had weight measurements made at study entry and at an average of 2.6 months later (range, 1–7 months); however, the second body-weight measurements were not available for four control subjects. The average percent body-weight loss for the six patients in the Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup treatment group was 2.1%; for the nine patients in the control group, the average percent body-weight loss was 11.6%. This 9.5% difference in body-weight loss was reported to be statistically significant. The two groups of patients had 
similar 
average body weights at study entry.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_46">KPS was measured at study entry and again 3 months later for all six patients in the Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup treatment group. For the 13 patients in the control group, KPS was measured at study entry and 1 to 3 months later. The first and second KPS scores did not differ substantially for the patients in the Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup treatment group. In fact, the second score was higher (indicating an improving condition) for five of the six patients; for the sixth patient, the first and second scores were the same.  The second KPS score was lower than the first (indicating a worsening condition) for all 13 patients in the control group. When the average KPS score at study entry for the control subjects was compared with the average score measured 1 to 3 months later, a statistically significant decline in KPS was noted.  The average KPS score at study entry for the patients in the control group was not substantially different from the average KPS score at study entry for patients in the Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup treatment group.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_47">Although treatment with Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup was associated with substantial benefits in this trial, the results cannot be considered conclusive. Several major weaknesses in the design and execution of the trial could have affected the outcome. One major weakness is the small numbers of patients enrolled in the survival arm (six patients in the Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup treatment group and 13 in the control group). Larger numbers of patients are needed to obtain reliable results.  Another weakness is that the patients in the survival arm were not <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000322881">randomly</GlossaryTermRef> assigned to the treatment group and the control group. The treatment group consisted of  individuals who agreed to be treated with Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup; those who refused treatment were assigned to  the control group. It is possible that important, unidentified differences existed between patients in the two groups.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_48">In 2001, the developer reported clinical findings for an additional 16 patients who had stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer and who had been treated with Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup.<Reference refidx="3"/> The formulation ingested by these patients was Frozen SV, or FSV.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> Among the 16 patients, 12 consumed FSV for a period of 2 months or more and were considered eligible for analysis. The duration of FSV treatment for these 12 patients ranged from 5 months to more than 46 months. All of the patients were treated with conventional therapy (one or more of the following: surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044294">pleurodesis</GlossaryTermRef>) in addition to treatment with Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup.</Para><Para id="_49">Among these 12 patients, two had no <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045869">residual tumor</GlossaryTermRef> after surgery to remove the primary tumor (n = 1) or surgery to remove the primary tumor and a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044169">contralateral</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045762">lymph node</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046710">metastasis</GlossaryTermRef> (n = 1). The patient with the lymph node metastasis consumed FSV for more than 32 months and remained tumor free more than 30 months. This patient survived more than 33 months.

Although <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044100">ingestion</GlossaryTermRef> of Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup was associated with improved survival in both studies, the results may not be reliable because of the small numbers of patients included in the studies (i.e., a total of 18 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044029">evaluable patients</GlossaryTermRef>) and because of other major weaknesses in the designs of the studies. Different formulations of Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup were used in the two studies, making a comparison of the results difficult.
