Patients who undergo aggressive surgical procedures for rectal cancer can have chronic symptoms, particularly if there is impairment of the anal sphincter.<Reference refidx="31"/> Patients treated with radiation therapy appear to have increased chronic bowel dysfunction, anorectal sphincter dysfunction (if the sphincter was surgically preserved), and sexual dysfunction than do patients who undergo surgical resection alone.<Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/><Reference refidx="35"/><Reference refidx="36"/><Reference refidx="37"/></Para><Para id="_886">An analysis of patients treated with postoperative chemotherapy and radiation

One reason for this difference is the concern in the United States for heightened late effects when high radiation doses per fraction are given.</Para><Para id="_891">A Polish study randomly assigned 316 patients to preoperative long-course chemoradiation therapy (50.4 Gy in 28 daily fractions with 5-FU and LV) or short-course preoperative radiation therapy (25 Gy in five fractions).<Reference refidx="37"/> 
Although the primary endpoint was sphincter preservation, late toxicity was not statistically significantly different between the two treatment approaches (7% long course vs. 10% short course). Of note, data on anal sphincter and sexual function were not reported, and toxicity was physician determined, not patient reported. </Para><Para id="_892">Ongoing clinical trials comparing preoperative and postoperative adjuvant chemoradiation therapy should further clarify the impact of either approach on bowel function and other important quality-of-life issues (e.g., sphincter preservation) in addition to the more conventional endpoints of DFS  and OS. </Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="16718838">Balch GC, De Meo A, Guillem JG: Modern management of rectal cancer: a 2006 update.
