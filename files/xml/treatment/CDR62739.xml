25% of cancer patients.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> Depression is believed to affect men and women with cancer equally, and gender-related differences in prevalence and severity have not been adequately evaluated.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Individuals and families who face a diagnosis of
cancer will experience varying levels of stress and emotional upset. Depression in patients with cancer not only affects the patients themselves but also has a major negative impact on their families.  A survey in England  of women with breast cancer showed that among several factors, depression  was the strongest predictor of emotional and behavioral problems in their children.<Reference refidx="6"/>  Fear of
death, disruption of life plans, changes in body image and self-esteem, changes
in social role and lifestyle, and financial and legal concerns are significant
issues in the life of any person with cancer, yet serious depression or anxiety is not
experienced by everyone who is diagnosed with cancer.
</Para><Para id="_374">Just as patients require ongoing evaluation for depression and anxiety throughout their course of treatment, so do family caregivers.  In a study of family caregivers of patients in the palliative phase of illness, both male and female caregivers experienced significantly more anxiety than normal samples, while there was an increased incidence of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale–defined depression among women.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_3">There are many myths about cancer and how people cope with it, such as the
following: </Para><ItemizedList id="_201" Style="bullet"><ListItem>All people with cancer are depressed.</ListItem><ListItem>Depression in a person with
cancer is normal.</ListItem><ListItem>Treatments are not helpful.</ListItem><ListItem>Everyone with cancer faces
suffering and a painful death.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_202">Sadness and grief are normal reactions to the
crises faced during cancer.  All people will experience these reactions periodically.  Because sadness is common, it is important to distinguish between
normal degrees of sadness and depressive disorders.  An end-of-life
consensus panel review article describes details regarding this important
distinction and illustrates the major points using case vignettes.<Reference refidx="8"/>  A
critical part of cancer care is the recognition of the  levels of
depression present and determination of the appropriate level of intervention, ranging from brief counseling or support groups to medication and/or psychotherapy. For example, relaxation and counseling interventions have been shown to reduce psychological symptoms in women with a new diagnosis of gynecological cancer.<Reference refidx="9"/>  Some people may have more
difficulty adjusting to the diagnosis of cancer than others and will vary in
their responses to the diagnosis.  Major depression is not simply sadness or a
blue mood.  Major depression affects approximately 25% of patients and has
recognizable symptoms that can and should be diagnosed and treated because they have an impact on quality of life.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/> Depression is also an underdiagnosed disorder in the general population.  Symptoms evident at the time of a cancer diagnosis may represent a preexisting condition and warrant separate evaluation and treatment.</Para><Para id="_429">Depression and anxiety disorders are common among patients receiving palliative care and contribute to a greatly diminished quality of life in these patients.<Reference refidx="12"/> In the Canadian National Palliative Care Survey, patients receiving palliative care for cancer (n = 381) were evaluated for depressive and anxiety disorders and for the impact of these disorders on quality of life.  The primary assessment tool was a modified version of the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD).  A significant number of participants (24.4%; 95% confidence interval, 20.2–29.0) were found to fulfill diagnostic criteria for at least one depressive or anxiety disorder (20.7% prevalence for depressive disorder and 13.1% for anxiety disorder).  Participants diagnosed with a disorder were significantly younger than the other participants (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .002), had lower performance status (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .017), had smaller social networks (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .008), and participated less in organized religious services (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .007).  They also reported more severe distress about physical symptoms, social concerns, and existential issues, suggesting significant negative impact on other aspects of their quality of life.<Reference refidx="12"/> The importance of psychological issues was underscored by another study conducted in terminally ill cancer patients (n = 211) with life expectancies of less than 6 months. Using specific validated psychometrics (e.g., visual analog scale), investigators evaluated patient “sense of burden to others” and its correlation with physical, psychological, and existential issues. The variables most highly correlated  with sense of burden to others included depression (<Emphasis>r</Emphasis> = 0.460, <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .0001), hopelessness (<Emphasis>r</Emphasis> = 0.420,  <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .0001), and outlook (<Emphasis>r</Emphasis> = 0.362,  <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .0001). In multiple regression analysis, four variables emerged predicting perception of burden to others: depression, hopelessness, level of fatigue, and current quality of life. No association between sense of burden to others and actual degree of physical dependency was found, implying that this perception is mainly mediated through psychological distress and existential issues. A subanalysis of patient groups from different settings suggested that these findings were consistent across the inpatient and outpatient settings, with some minor variations.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para><Para id="_4">Normally, a patient's initial emotional response to a diagnosis of cancer is
brief, extending over several days to weeks, and may include feelings of
disbelief, denial, or despair.     This normal response is part of a spectrum of
depressive symptoms that range from normal sadness to adjustment disorder with
depressed mood to major depression.<Reference refidx="8"/>  Other syndromes described include
dysthymia and subsyndromal depression (also called minor depression or
subclinical depression).  Dysthymia is a chronic mood disorder in which a
depressed mood is present on more days than not for at least 2 years.  In
contrast, subsyndromal depression is an acute mood disorder that is less severe
(some, but not all, diagnostic symptoms present) than major depression.
</Para><Para id="_5">The emotional response to a diagnosis of cancer (or cancer relapse) may begin
as a dysphoric period marked by increasing turmoil.  The individual will
experience sleep and appetite disturbance, anxiety, ruminative thoughts, and
fears about the future.  Epidemiologic studies, however, suggest that at least
one half of all people diagnosed with cancer will successfully adapt.  Markers
of successful adaptation include maintaining active involvement in daily
life;  minimizing the disruptions caused by the illness to one's life roles (e.g., spouse, parent, employee);  regulating the normal emotional reactions to the
illness; and  managing feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, worthlessness,
and/or guilt.<Reference refidx="14"/> Some studies suggest an association between maladaptive coping styles with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and fatigue symptoms.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/>  Examples of maladaptive coping behaviors include  avoidant or negative coping, negative self-coping statements, preoccupation with physical symptoms, and catastrophizing.  One study conducted in a group of 86 mostly late-stage cancer patients suggested that maladaptive coping styles and higher levels of depressive symptoms are potential predictors of the timing of disease progression.<Reference refidx="16"/>    Another study examining coping strategies in women with breast cancer (n = 138) concluded that patients with better coping skills such as positive self-statements have lower levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms.<Reference refidx="15"/> The same study found racial differences in the use of coping strategies, with African American women reporting and benefiting  more from the use of religious coping strategies such as prayer and hopefulness than did Caucasian women.<Reference refidx="15"/>    Preliminary data suggest a beneficial impact of spirituality on associated depression, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy—Spiritual Well-Being (FACIT-Sp) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.<Reference refidx="17"/></Para><Para id="_460">The following indicators may suggest a need for early
intervention:</Para><ItemizedList id="_461" Style="bullet"><ListItem>A  history of depression.</ListItem><ListItem>A weak social support system (not
married, few friends, a solitary work environment).</ListItem><ListItem>Evidence of persistent
irrational beliefs or negativistic thinking regarding the diagnosis.</ListItem><ListItem>A more
serious prognosis.</ListItem><ListItem>Greater dysfunction related to cancer.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_462">As shown by a study of adult cancer patients (n = 48) and their adult relatives (n = 99),  family functioning is an important factor that impacts patient and family distress.  Families that were able to act openly, express feelings directly, and solve problems effectively had lower levels of depression, and direct communication of information within the family was associated with lower levels of anxiety.<Reference refidx="18"/> Depressive symptoms in spouses of patients with cancer can also have a negative impact on their marital communication.  A preliminary study investigated 19 potential predictors of depression in spouses (n = 206) of women with nonmetastatic breast cancer.<Reference refidx="19"/>  Spouses were more likely to experience depressive symptoms if they were older, were less well educated, were more recently married, reported heightened fears over their wife's well-being, worried about their job performance, were more uncertain about their future, or were in less well-adjusted marriages.<Reference refidx="19"/></Para><Para id="_195">Risk factors may be different, especially pain and other physical symptoms.<Reference refidx="20"/> When the
clinician begins to suspect that a patient is depressed, he or she will assess
the patient for symptoms.  Mild or subclinical levels of depression that
include some, but not all, of the diagnostic criteria for a major depressive
episode can cause considerable distress and may warrant interventions such as
supportive individual or group counseling, either by a mental health
professional or through participation in a self-help support group.<Reference refidx="21"/> Evidence-based recommendations have been published describing various approaches to the problems of cancer-related fatigue, anorexia, depression, and dyspnea.<Reference refidx="22"/> Even in
the absence of any symptoms, many patients express interest in supportive
counseling, and clinicians should try to accommodate those patients by a
referral to a qualified mental health professional.  When symptoms are
more intense,  longer lasting, or recurrent after apparent resolution, however,
treatment to alleviate symptoms is essential.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/>  Anxiety and depression
in early treatment are good predictors of these same problems at 6 months.<Reference refidx="25"/>      In a  study of older women with breast cancer, a recent diagnosis of depression was associated with both a greater likelihood of not receiving definitive cancer treatment and poorer survival.<Reference refidx="26"/> </Para><Para id="_420">The pathophysiology of cancer-related depression remains unclear and probably encompasses many mechanisms.  A study of patients with advanced metastatic cancer showed that both plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction were markedly higher in patients with clinical depression.<Reference refidx="27"/> A cut-off value of 10.6 pg/mL for IL-6 yielded a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 87%, while a cut-off value of 33.5% for cortisol variations yielded a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 88%.  One limitation of this study was that neither pain levels nor fatigue levels were measured, which might independently affect these relationships.</Para><Para id="_1_4">In this summary, unless otherwise stated, evidence and practice issues as they relate to adults are discussed.  The evidence and application to practice related to children may differ significantly from information related to adults.  When specific information about the care of children is available, it is summarized under its own heading.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="8988260" MedlineID="97142010">Henriksson MM, Isometsä ET, Hietanen PS, et al.: Mental disorders in cancer suicides.

such as “I brought this on myself," "God is punishing me," or "I'm letting my

realistic evidence to the contrary.  Such thinking may predominate or may
alternate with more realistic thinking, yet remain very stressful.  Some
individuals will share negativistic thoughts freely, and family members
may be aware of them.  Other patients will not volunteer such thinking but will
respond to brief inquiries such as the following (other examples are listed in <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062739#_356" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/depression-hp-pdq">Table 1</SummaryRef>):

</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_226">It is possible for a physician or nurse to ask these types of questions without
becoming engaged in providing counseling themselves.  Merely asking these
questions will express concern and increase the likelihood that the patient
will be receptive to suggestions for further counseling.
</Para><Para id="_227">A statement such as the following can then follow these questions:</Para><Para id="_228">“Many people with cancer sometimes have these feelings.  You are not alone. 
But talking to someone else about them can greatly help.  I'd like to suggest
that you consider doing that. Would you be willing to talk to someone who has a
lot of experience helping people cope with the stress of having cancer?”
</Para><Para id="_229">It is preferable at this time both to encourage the patient to seek out someone
already known to him or her and to inform him or her of other resources in the
community.  Particularly for patients who have completed cancer treatment and
who have manageable physical symptoms, higher perceived availability of social
support has been associated with fewer depressive symptoms.<Reference refidx="2"/>  In some
instances, referral to a clergy person or therapist may also be appropriate. 
Most therapists can address general issues of grief or fears about death; some
will specialize in clinical health psychology, medical social work, or even
working primarily with cancer patients.  For the hesitant patient, suggesting
multiple resources will increase the likelihood that some assistance will be
sought.  For other patients, a formal direct referral may be appropriate.  
</Para><Para id="_230">Evaluation of depression in people with cancer should include careful
assessment of symptoms, treatment effects, laboratory data results, physical
status, and mental status.  Although the etiology of depression is largely
unknown, many risk factors for depression are known (see list below).  Limited data suggest that depressive symptomatology in cancer patients undergoing cytokine therapy with interferon-alfa and interleukin-2 may be mediated by changes in availability of neurotransmitter precursors.<Reference refidx="3"/>    For
patients with head and neck cancer treated with curative intent, eight
pretreatment variables (tumor stage, sex, depressive symptoms, openness to
discuss cancer in the family, perceived available support, received emotional
support, tumor-related symptoms, and size of the informal social network) can
be used to predict which patients are likely to become depressed up to 3 years
after treatment.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/> A prospective study of terminally ill Japanese patients who were assessed for psychiatric illness by structured clinical interview at the time of registration (baseline) and again at admission to a palliative care unit (follow-up) found that 5 (42%) of  the 12 patients diagnosed with adjustment disorder at baseline progressed to major depression at follow-up.   Only the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was significantly predictive of psychiatric diagnoses at follow-up.<Reference refidx="6"/>     Heightened awareness of this facilitates early diagnosis
and the use of appropriate interventions.<Reference refidx="7"/>
In the medically ill, early manifestations of delirium may be mistaken for anxiety or depression.  These disorders should be considered among the differential diagnoses in individuals who present with depressive symptoms.</Para><ItemizedList id="_231" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListTitle>Risk Factors for Depression in People With Cancer</ListTitle><ListItem>Cancer-related risk factors:<ItemizedList id="_232" Style="dash"><ListItem>Depression at time of cancer diagnosis.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/></ListItem><ListItem>Poorly controlled pain.<Reference refidx="10"/></ListItem><ListItem>Advanced stage of cancer.<Reference refidx="10"/></ListItem><ListItem>Increased physical impairment or discomfort.</ListItem><ListItem>Pancreatic cancer.<Reference refidx="11"/></ListItem><ListItem>Being unmarried and having head and neck cancer.<Reference refidx="12"/></ListItem><ListItem>Treatment with certain chemotherapeutic agents:<ItemizedList id="_233" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Corticosteroids.

have not been shown to be more clinically useful than an interview and a

Disorders (DSM-IV) symptoms for major depressive disorder, was investigated.  Sensitivity and specificity characteristics were evaluated, and the optimal cutoff score of 7 was identified, resulting in a sensitivity of 0.81 and a specificity of 0.85 for detecting depression.  Therefore, individuals scoring 7 or above should undergo a more thorough psychosocial evaluation.<Reference refidx="30"/></Para><Para id="_459">A modification of the Distress Thermometer, the Impact Thermometer, to be used in combination with the Distress Thermometer, has improved specificity for the detection of adjustment disorders and/or major depression, as compared with the Distress Thermometer.  The revised tool has a screening performance comparable to that of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and is brief, potentially making it an effective tool for routine screening in oncology settings.<Reference refidx="31"/> The Mood Evaluation Questionnaire, a cognitive-based screening tool for depression, has moderate correlation with the structured clinical interview for DSM-III-R and good acceptability in the  palliative care population.     With further validation, it may become a useful alternative in this population because it can be used by clinicians who are not trained in psychiatry.<Reference refidx="32"/>
</Para><Para id="_21">It is important that screening instruments be validated in cancer populations
and used in combination with structured diagnostic interviews.<Reference refidx="33"/>    A pilot
study of 25 patients used a simple, easily reproduced visual analog scale
suggesting the benefits to a single-item approach to screening for depression. 
This scale consists of a 10-cm line with a sad face at one end and a happy face
at the other end, on which patients make a mark to indicate their mood. 
Although the results do suggest that a visual analog scale may be useful as a
screening tool for depression, the small patient numbers and lack of clinical
interviews limit conclusions.  Furthermore, although very high correlations
with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were reported (<Emphasis>r</Emphasis> = 0.87), no
indication of cut-offs was given.  Finally, it should be emphasized that such
a tool is intended to suggest the need for further professional assessment. 
However, if validated further, this simple approach could greatly enhance
assessment and management of depression in cognitively intact advanced cancer
patients.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="34"/> Other brief assessment tools for depression can be used.  To help patients distinguish normal anxiety reactions from depression, assessment should include discussion about common symptoms experienced by cancer patients.   Depression should be reassessed over time.<Reference refidx="35"/>   Because of the increased risk of adjustment disorders and major
depression in cancer patients, routine screening with increased vigilance at
times of increased stress (e.g., diagnosis, recurrences, progression) is

(MSRMC), as they are now referred to in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
for Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV), often mimic the mood syndromes in
their presentation.  The assumption is made (perhaps based on their time course
or laboratory data) that an organic or medical factor has a role in the
etiology of the syndrome.  The DSM-IV suggests that prominent cognitive
abnormalities may be accompanying factors and therefore are useful in making
the diagnosis.  The DSM-IV also highlights profound apathy as a sign of MSRMC.
Consideration should be given to obtaining laboratory data to assist in
detection of electrolyte or endocrine imbalances or the presence of nutritional
deficiencies.  Clinical experience suggests that pharmacotherapy is more
advantageous than psychotherapy alone in the treatment of depression that is
caused by medical factors, particularly if the dosages of the causative
agent(s) (i.e., steroids, antibiotics, or other medications) cannot be
decreased or discontinued.<Reference refidx="38"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_358" Style="bullet"><ListTitle>Possible Medical Causes of Depressive Symptoms in People With Cancer*</ListTitle><ListItem>Uncontrolled pain.<Reference refidx="10"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</ListItem><ListItem>Metabolic abnormalities:<ItemizedList id="_359" Style="dash"><ListItem>Hypercalcemia.

of depression, the clinician should confirm that these symptoms will have lasted a minimum of 2 weeks and are present on most days.  The
diagnosis of depression in people with cancer can be difficult due to the
problems inherent in distinguishing biological or physical symptoms of
depression from symptoms of illness or toxic side effects of treatment.  This
is particularly true of individuals who are receiving active treatment or those
with advanced disease.  Cognitive symptoms such as guilt, worthlessness,
hopelessness, thoughts of suicide, and loss of pleasure in activities are
probably the most useful in diagnosing depression in people with cancer.
One German study comparing cancer patients  who had a current affective disorder with those who had a single depressive symptom found loss of interest, followed by depressed mood, to yield the highest power of discrimination between the two groups on multivariate analysis.<Reference refidx="43"/></Para><Para id="_221">The evaluation of depression in people with cancer should also include a
careful assessment of the person's perception of the illness, medical history,
personal or family history of depression or thoughts of suicide, current mental
status, and physical status, as well as treatment and disease effects,
concurrent life stressors, and availability of social supports.  It is
important to understand that more than 90% of patients indicate that they
prefer to discuss emotional issues with their physician, but over one quarter
of patients feel that the physician must initiate any discussion of that
topic.<Reference refidx="44"/>  Suicidal ideation, when it occurs, is frightening for the
individual, the health professional, and the family.  Suicidal
statements may range from an offhand comment resulting from frustration or
disgust with a treatment course: “If I have to have one more bone marrow
aspiration this year, I'll jump out the window,” to a reflection of significant
despair and an emergent situation: “I can no longer bear what this disease is
doing to all of us, and I am going to kill myself.”  Exploring the seriousness
of the thoughts is imperative.  If the suicidal thoughts are believed to be
serious, a referral to a psychiatrist or psychologist should be made
immediately and attention should be given to the patient's safety.  Additional
information on suicide can be found in the
<SummaryRef href="CDR0000062739#_98" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/depression-hp-pdq">Suicide Risk in Cancer Patients</SummaryRef> section.
</Para><Para id="_17">The most common form of depressive symptomatology in people with cancer is an
adjustment disorder with depressed mood, sometimes referred to as reactive
depression.  This disorder is manifested when a person has a dysphoric mood
that is accompanied by the inability to perform usual activities.<Reference refidx="45"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] The symptoms
appear to be prolonged and in excess of a normal and expected reaction but do
not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.  When these symptoms
significantly interfere with a person's daily functioning, such as attending to
work or school activities, shopping, or caring for a household, they should be
treated in the same way that major depression is treated (i.e., consider using
crisis intervention, supportive psychotherapy, and medication, especially with
drugs that quickly relieve distressing symptoms).  Basing the diagnosis on
these symptoms can  be problematic when the individual has advanced
disease and the illness itself is undermining functioning.  It is also important to distinguish between fatigue and depression, which are often interrelated.  The different mechanisms that  give rise to these conditions can be treated separately.<Reference refidx="1"/>  In more advanced
illness, focusing on despair, guilty thoughts, and a total lack of enjoyment of
life is helpful in diagnosing depression.

Since 2003, U.S. and European regulators have issued several public health warnings on this topic. The first such advisory issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned about a possible association between antidepressants and suicidal thinking and behavior in children and adolescents. In December 2003, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency of the United Kingdom issued a letter to doctors advising against the use of antidepressants in anyone younger than 18 years.<Reference refidx="12"/>
 In October 2004, the FDA mandated pharmaceutical companies to add a “black box” warning to the labeling of all antidepressants suggesting increased risk of suicidality in pediatric patients who were taking antidepressants. The FDA revised this boxed warning in May 2007 to include young adults younger than 25 years.<Reference refidx="13"/> The new, carefully worded warning emphasizes that the risk of suicidality is associated with both antidepressants and depression. In addition to raising concerns about increased suicidality in children, adolescents, and young adults, the warning acknowledges a significant protective effect of antidepressants in adults aged 65 and older.</Para><Para id="_474">The meta-analysis that led to the initial boxed warning in pediatric patients concluded that the antidepressants are associated with a twofold increase in suicidal ideation and behavior compared to the placebo in children and adolescents.<Reference refidx="14"/> A major meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association reanalyzed the data from the child and adolescent studies (including seven studies not included in the initial meta-analysis), using a random-effects model.<Reference refidx="15"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] While this reanalysis found an overall increased risk of suicidal ideation/suicidal behavior consistent with the initial meta-analysis, the pooled risk differences were found to be smaller and statistically insignificant.</Para><Para id="_475">Concerns have been raised that the unintended consequence of the warnings will be overly restricted use of antidepressants among those who benefit the most and, hence, an increase in suicidality that the warning seeks to prevent. A study examining U.S. and Dutch data suggests a drop in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) prescriptions for children and adolescents since the boxed warning was issued and a simultaneous increase in suicide rates in this patient population.<Reference refidx="16"/></Para><Para id="_476">In summary, the risk/benefit equation favors appropriate use of antidepressants with careful monitoring for suicidality. It is important to note that none of the studies that led to the boxed warning included or focused on patients being treated for cancer. Clinical experience and results of small clinical trials suggest that antidepressants can be safely administered to adult cancer patients, although there are no large controlled clinical trials to support this position. When antidepressants are prescribed for patients with cancer, a careful monitoring plan should be implemented by individuals with expertise, and consultation referral should be made for patients who do not respond as anticipated or who present other concerns.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_396"><Title>Interferon-related depression</Title><Para id="_385">Most antidepressant prescribing is directed at the treatment of an existing
depressive disorder or significant depressive symptoms.  One study, however,
supports the use of antidepressants to prevent depression in patients receiving
high-dose interferon for adjuvant therapy of malignant melanoma.<Reference refidx="17"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]  The
rationale for this approach is that treatment with high-dose interferon is
associated with a particularly high rate of depression in this patient
population, and proinflammatory cytokines implicated in the biological changes
that result in depression may be directly reduced by antidepressants.  In this
double-blind study of patients receiving high-dose interferon, 2 of 18 patients
in the paroxetine group developed depression during the first 12 weeks of
therapy, compared with 9 of 20 patients in the placebo group (relative risk [RR] =  0.24;
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08–0.93).  Moreover, there were significantly fewer treatment
discontinuations in the paroxetine group (5% vs. 35%, RR = 0.14; 95% CI,
0.05–0.85).  Further study is required to confirm these findings and to
determine whether prophylactic use of antidepressants has benefit in
other treatment settings.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_312"><Title>Antidepressant medication selection</Title><Para id="_313">The choice of antidepressant depends on a patient's medical history and
concomitant medical problems, the symptoms referable to depression,  previous
responses to antidepressant medications, and the side effects associated with
the agents available.</Para><Para id="_333">The types of medications used to treat depression in patients with cancer
include the SSRIs, tricyclic
antidepressants (TCAs), and analeptic or CNS stimulant
agents (i.e., amphetamines).  <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062739#_403" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/depression-hp-pdq">Table 2</SummaryRef> outlines the commonly used
antidepressants and highlights starting dosages used in cancer patients.   The Side Effects/Comments column identifies drug-specific 
side effects that may be clinically advantageous or
problematic depending on the clinical situation when selecting antidepressant
medications and monitoring patients receiving these drugs.  Generally, there is
a long latency period (3–6 weeks) from initiation of antidepressant
medications until the onset of a therapeutic response.  In many cases,
antidepressant treatment begins at low doses followed by a period of gradual dose titration to
achieve an optimum individualized response.  Initial low doses may help to
avoid initial side effects, but dose escalation may be required in order to see
therapeutic effects.  For some agents, there is a therapeutic window during which
plasma concentrations correlate with a patient's antidepressant response (e.g.,
nortriptyline).  For patients receiving these agents, serial drug concentration
monitoring guides therapy and facilitates providing an adequate therapeutic
trial, because plasma concentrations less than and greater than the defined
therapeutic ranges are associated with treatment failure, suboptimal responses,
and in the case of high drug concentrations, unnecessary toxicity.</Para><Table id="_403"><Title>Table 2. Antidepressant Medications for Ambulatory Adult Patients</Title>

side effects  may have a clinical advantage.  For example, some
TCAs, such as  amitriptyline, and atypical antidepressants, such as mirtazapine and trazodone, produce
sedation and may be useful for agitated patients and for those who have
difficulty getting to sleep.  Consequently, treatment is often initiated as a
single daily dose administered at bedtime.  Although most patients will develop
tolerance to antidepressants' sedative effects with continued treatment, the
need for soporific agents may diminish with improvement in depressive symptoms.</Para><Para id="_335">When selecting antidepressants, either singly or in combination, consider the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_336" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Target specific distressing symptoms.</ListItem><ListItem>Evaluate coexistent medical problems that may be exacerbated by particular

All currently available SSRIs are equally efficacious; they differ primarily in their safety, tolerability, half-lives, and drug-drug interactions. While some side effects are more common with some SSRIs than with others, side effects and tolerability may differ significantly in individual patients. SSRIs have become the first-line treatment for depressive disorders, owing to their better tolerability side effect profile, especially in comparison with the TCAs. As discussed earlier, antidepressant studies conducted in patients with cancer are done mostly with SSRIs or TCAs.   None of the clinical trials have included or focused on children and adolescents being treated for cancer.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/>   <Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]  Overall, the evidence on the efficacy of SSRIs for treating cancer-related depression remains limited, and more studies are needed to address the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and drug-drug interaction issues in the context of cancer and cancer treatments. The British Committee on Safety of Medicines considered only one of the SSRIs (fluoxetine) to have a favorable balance of risks and benefits, but it is only considered beneficial in approximately one in ten patients.<Reference refidx="23"/> Consistent with this finding, age-stratified analyses of the child and adolescent studies found that for children younger than 12 years with major depression, only fluoxetine showed benefit over placebo.<Reference refidx="15"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] As noted, none of the children or adolescents in these studies had cancer, so there are no reports available that address whether there are additional increased risks of adverse events associated with the use of SSRIs following exposure to different chemotherapeutic agents and/or central nervous system (CNS) radiation treatment.  Frontline, alternative, effective, behavioral, and pharmacologic treatments for depression should be used for children and adolescents being treated for cancer.  However, if the risks of depression are significant and SSRIs are considered,  consultation from a child psychiatrist or neurologist is essential, and close monitoring of potential adverse events is crucial.  No warning has been issued for adult use of SSRIs.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_314"><Title>Discontinuation of antidepressants</Title><Para id="_315">The optimal duration of antidepressant therapy for patients treated for depressive
symptoms (without a depressive disorder) is unknown.  Patients with a
depressive disorder   who achieve a beneficial response to
antidepressant pharmacotherapy should continue treatment for a minimum of 4 to
6 months after depression resolves.  When patients are discontinuing antidepressant
medications, TCA doses should be tapered by approximately 25% per week to avoid
cholinergic rebound (e.g., hypersalivation, diarrhea).  In patients who
experience intolerable adverse effects, however, doses may be tapered quickly.
With the exception of fluoxetine, gradual tapering is advised when decreasing
doses or discontinuing treatment for all SSRIs.  Other antidepressants with
short half-lives, such as venlafaxine, also should be tapered gradually. 
Withdrawal symptoms, both somatic and psychological, frequently emerge after
abrupt discontinuation, during intermittent noncompliance, and sometimes during
dose reduction; though these symptoms are generally mild, short-lived, and 
self-limiting, they can be distressing and may lead to missed workdays and
decreased productivity.  Mild symptoms can often be treated by reassuring a
patient that they are usually transient.  For more severe symptoms, it may be
necessary to reinstate the dosage of the original antidepressant and slow the
rate of taper.  Symptoms of discontinuation may be mistaken for physical
illness or relapse into depression and misdiagnosis may lead to unnecessary,
costly tests and treatment.  Thus, health care professionals need to be
educated about the potential adverse effects of SSRI discontinuation.<Reference refidx="24"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_316"><Title>Side effects</Title><Para id="_317">TCAs can produce abnormal myocardial conduction; thus, a cardiac history and a
recent EKG should be obtained in patients with a history of cardiac problems. 
Many tricyclic antidepressants have a sedating effect; therefore, treatment
typically is started at low doses at bedtime.  The main exception is
desipramine, which some patients find mildly stimulating and can be administered
in the morning to reduce insomnia, if it develops.  Daily doses are increased
slowly every few days or at weekly intervals until symptoms improve.  Many
patients become tolerant to the drugs' sedative effects, and total daily doses
may be divided and given during patients' waking cycles.</Para><Para id="_338">TCAs are still regarded as first-line agents for severe, major
depression; however, SSRI use is increasing for that indication because of the
effectiveness of SSRIs and the low risk of clinically significant side effects that are
associated with TCAs, such as cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, and
anticholinergic effects.  In addition, TCAs are highly toxic on overdose.  Side
effects commonly associated with the SSRIs include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
somnolence, insomnia, headache, confusion, dizziness, asthenia, and sexual
dysfunction.  Drug-specific adverse effects associated with fluoxetine include
gastric distress, brief periods of anxiety or agitation, and anorgasmia in

Marked differences exist, however, between the SSRIs and SSRI metabolites with
regard to their effects on specific cytochrome P450 enzymes.<Reference refidx="18"/>  For example,
both fluoxetine and norfluoxetine inhibit CYP3A4 isoenzyme; however, the
metabolite is more potent than fluoxetine and in view of its longer half-life
the potential for interactions may persist for weeks after fluoxetine is
discontinued.<Reference refidx="27"/>  Understanding the similarities and differences in their
pharmacology can aid clinicians in using these agents optimally and avoiding
clinically important pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions.  In addition,
since all SSRIs are highly protein-bound to albumin (± alpha-1 acid
glycoprotein), clinicians must consider their potential for interactions with
other highly protein-bound medications.  Sertraline and paroxetine may be
preferred in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction since they are

The data do not support a strong effect on major depressive disorder or even on mild to moderate depression.  This fact, combined with concerns about drug interactions and lack of standardization, makes St. John's wort an unattractive alternative for depression management. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_330"><Title>Antidepressant effects</Title><Para id="_331"><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062739#_352" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/depression-hp-pdq">Table 5</SummaryRef> and <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062739#_353" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/depression-hp-pdq">Table 6</SummaryRef> highlight  tips that may be useful in determining what

psychotherapy, which is quite useful for some people with cancer.      For many
other people, these symptoms are best managed with some combination of crisis
intervention, brief supportive psychotherapy, and cognitive-behavioral
techniques.</Para><Para id="_371"> Psychotherapy for depression has been offered in  a variety of forms. Most interventions have been time limited (ranging between 4 and 30 hours), have been offered in both individual and small-group formats, and have included a structured educational component about cancer or a specific relaxation component.<Reference refidx="62"/></Para><Para id="_372">Cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy has been one of the most prominent types of therapies studied in recent investigations. Cognitive-behavioral interventions focus on altering specific coping strategies aimed at improving overall adjustment and typically focus on specific thoughts and their relationship to emotions and behaviors. Understanding and altering one’s thoughts can change emotional reactions and accompanying behaviors. For example, frequent, intrusive, uncontrollable thoughts about loss, life changes, or death can cause poor concentration and precipitate feelings of sadness, guilt, and worthlessness. In turn, these feelings can result in increased sleep, withdrawal, and isolation. A cognitive-behavioral intervention focuses on the intrusive thoughts, often challenging their accuracy or rationality and noting specific patterns of cognitive distortions. Simultaneously, patients develop specific cognitive coping strategies that are designed to alter emotional reactions and accompanying behaviors. The end result is improved coping, enhanced adjustment, and better overall quality of life.</Para><Para id="_378">Other goals of psychotherapy include enhancing coping skills, directly reducing distress, improving problem-solving skills, mobilizing support, reshaping negative or self-defeating thoughts, and developing a close personal bond with a knowledgeable, empathic health care provider.<Reference refidx="63"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>];<Reference refidx="64"/><Reference refidx="65"/><Reference refidx="66"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]<Reference refidx="67"/>  Consultation with a cleric or a member of a pastoral care department may also help some individuals.</Para><Para id="_76">Specific goals of these therapies include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_77" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Assist people with cancer and their families by answering questions about the illness and its treatment, clarifying information, correcting misunderstandings, giving reassurance, and normalizing responses to the illness and its effect on their families.

Problem-solving tasks were emphasized, including skills in (a) better defining and formulating the nature of problems, (b) generating a wide range of alternative solutions, (c) systematically evaluating consequences of a solution while deciding on an optimal one, and (d) evaluating outcome after solution implementation. Between-session homework with tasks relevant to each step was assigned, and patients were provided with a written manual and encouraged to refer to it as problems arose. One hundred thirty-two adult cancer patients were randomly assigned to the problem-solving treatment or a wait-list control.

to the incidence in the general population or up to 2 to 10 times as frequent. 
Some studies suggest that while relatively few cancer patients commit suicide,
they are at increased risk for suicide.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>  One population-based study utilizing data from the Cancer Registry of Norway linked to the Register of Deaths at Statistics Norway indicated an increased relative risk of suicide in the decade 1990-1999 within 2 years of diagnosis for males and females; however, the relative risk for females was nonsignificant.   For both sexes, the risk was highest in the first months after diagnosis, and there was a significant decrease in relative risk over decades.<Reference refidx="4"/> Passive suicidal thoughts are
relatively common among cancer patients.  The relationships between suicidal
tendency and the desire for hastened death, requests for physician-assisted
suicide, and/or euthanasia are complex and poorly understood.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Men with
cancer are clearly at an increased risk of suicide compared with the general
population, with a relative risk as high as 2.3.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>  Overdosing with
analgesics and sedatives is the most common method of suicide among persons
with cancer,<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> with most cancer-related suicides occurring at home.  Reports
identify a higher incidence of suicide in patients with oral, pharyngeal, and
lung cancers and in HIV-positive patients with Kaposi sarcoma.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="5"/>  The
actual incidence of suicide in cancer patients is probably underestimated. 
There may be reluctance to report death by suicide in these circumstances.<Reference refidx="6"/>

In the assessment of
suicide, it is important to recognize that the risk of suicide increases if the
patient reports ideation (i.e., thoughts of suicide) plus a plan (i.e.,
description of the means).  Risk continues to increase to the extent that the
plan is lethal.  Lethality is determined by an assessment of how likely death
would follow, if the reported plan were carried out.  Factors to consider in
assessing lethality include availability of the means, reversibility of the
means (once begun can it be stopped), and proximity to help.  In the cancer
patient reporting suicidal ideation, it is essential to determine whether the
underlying cause is a depressive illness or an expression of the desire to have
ultimate control over intolerable symptoms.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Prompt identification and
treatment of major depression is essential in lowering the risk for suicide in
cancer patients.  Risk factors, particularly hopelessness (which is an even
stronger predictive factor for suicide than is depression) should be carefully
assessed.<Reference refidx="2"/>  The assessment of hopelessness is not straightforward in the
patient with advanced disease with no hope of cure.  It is important to assess
the underlying reasons for hopelessness, which may be related to poor symptom
management, fears of painful death, or feelings of abandonment.<Reference refidx="3"/>
Of 220 Japanese patients who had cancer and who were diagnosed with major depression after being
referred for psychiatric consultation, approximately 50% reported suicidal
ideation.  In a retrospective analysis of predictors of  suicidal ideation,
researchers found that those with more symptoms of major depression and poorer
physical functioning were significantly more likely to report suicidal
ideation.<Reference refidx="4"/>
</Para><Para id="_264">Establishing rapport is of prime importance in working with suicidal cancer
patients as it serves as the foundation for other interventions.  The clinician
must believe that talking about suicide will not cause the patient to attempt
suicide.  On the contrary, talking about suicide legitimizes this concern and
permits patients to describe their feelings and fears, providing a sense of
control.<Reference refidx="5"/>  A supportive therapeutic relationship should be maintained, which
conveys the attitude that much can be done to alleviate emotional and physical
pain.  (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062738" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/pain/pain-hp-pdq">Pain</SummaryRef> for more information.)  A crisis
intervention–oriented psychotherapeutic approach should be initiated that
mobilizes as much of a patient's support system as possible.  Contributing
symptoms (e.g., pain) should be aggressively controlled and depression,
psychosis, agitation, and underlying causes of delirium should be treated.<Reference refidx="5"/> 
(Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062772" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/memory/delirium-hp-pdq">Delirium</SummaryRef> for more information.)  These problems
are most frequently managed in the medical hospital or at home.  Although
uncommon, psychiatric hospitalization can be helpful when there is a clear
indication and the patient is medically stable.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Table id="_362"><Title>Table 7. Suggested Questions for the Assessment of

to prevent suicide that is driven by desperation due to poorly controlled
symptoms.  Prolonged suffering due to poorly controlled symptoms can lead to
such desperation.  Thus, effective symptom management is critical to decrease
psychological distress in suicidal cancer patients.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Patients close to the
end of life may be unable to maintain a wakeful state without high levels of
emotional or physical pain.  This frequently leads to suicidal thoughts or
requests for aid in dying.  Such patients may require sedation to ease their
distress.</Para><Para id="_267">At times, it may be important  to limit access to potentially lethal medications for patients considered at risk for suicide.  When potentially lethal medications are limited, it is important to weigh the impact on symptom management against the impact on suicide risk because  poorly controlled symptoms may contribute to risk.  Furthermore, suicidal patients will often have other means available to complete suicide attempts and these must also be evaluated.  Strategies to lessen suicidal risk include frequent contact to reassess suicidal risk and symptom control, as well as regular delivery of limited quantities of medications  facilitating rapid dose titration for effective management of poorly controlled symptoms when necessary.  For patients receiving parenteral or intrathecal opioids, programmable pumps with limited access to programming and locked, inaccessible cartridges may provide an element of safety.</Para><Para id="_268">Strategies to lessen suicide risk in  cancer patients include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_269" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Use medications that work rapidly to alleviate distress (e.g., a

</ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_237"><Title>Effect on Family and Health Care Providers</Title><Para id="_238">When suicide complicates bereavement, the loss can be especially difficult for
survivors.  A pattern of reactions that includes feelings of abandonment,
rejection, anger, relief, guilt, responsibility, denial, identification, and
shame may occur.  This pattern is modified by such factors as the nature and
intensity of the relationship, the nature of the suicide, the deceased person's
age and physical condition, the perceived support network, and the survivor's
coping skills and cultural/religious background.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Assisting survivors
through the bereavement period is important.  Mutual support groups are helpful
in reducing isolation, providing opportunities for venting feelings, and
finding ways to cope with the aftermath of suicide. (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062821" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/caregivers/planning/bereavement-hp-pdq">Grief, Bereavement, and Coping With Loss</SummaryRef> for further information.)</Para><Para id="_239">Staff reactions to the suicide of a patient are similar to those seen in family
members, although staff often do not feel that they have the same right to
express their feelings.  The suicide of a patient may lead a staff member to
question his or her professional judgment.  It is often helpful for the staff
to conduct a psychological autopsy in an attempt to understand why and how
the suicide happened, signs and symptoms of risk, and how routines might be
altered to prevent similar problems in the future.<Reference refidx="5"/> 
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_240"><Title>Assisted Dying, Euthanasia, and Decisions Regarding End of Life</Title><Para id="_241">The principle of respecting and promoting patient autonomy has been one of the
driving forces behind the hospice movement and right-to-die issues that range
from honoring living wills to promoting euthanasia.  These issues can create a
conflict between patient autonomy and the physician's obligation to
beneficence.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_242">Answers to the questions of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide belong to
the realm of the law, ethics, medicine, and philosophy.  Physicians and other
health care professionals have essential clinical roles to play in addressing
and untangling these issues when working with depressed, terminally ill
patients.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/>  Additionally, religious and cultural issues may strongly
influence this decision-making process.  A 1994 survey suggests that hospice
physicians favor vigorous pain control and strongly approve of the right of
patients to refuse life support even if life is secondarily shortened. However,
these physicians strongly oppose euthanasia or assisted suicide, clearly making
a sharp distinction between these two interventions.<Reference refidx="7"/>  Often patients who
specifically request physician-assisted suicide can be prescribed measures that
augment their comfort, relieve symptoms, and obviate considering drastic
measures.<Reference refidx="1"/>    A recent study suggests that agreement with euthanasia is associated with male sex, lack of religious beliefs, and general beliefs about the suffering of cancer patients.<Reference refidx="14"/> A 1995 study of persons with advanced cancer who expressed a
consistent and strong desire for hastened deaths suggested that this desire is
related to the presence of depression.  Patients with the desire to die should
be carefully assessed and treated for depression as necessary. 
Whether their desire to die would persist or decrease with improvement in mood
disorder has not yet been studied.<Reference refidx="15"/>    It is important to maintain a shared decision-making process from the beginning
of the professional relationship.<Reference refidx="16"/> (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000543592" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/caregivers/planning/last-days-hp-pdq">Last Days of Life</SummaryRef> for more information.)</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="7963785" MedlineID="95052958">Massie MJ, Gagnon P, Holland JC: Depression and suicide in patients with cancer.

The clinician may face many ethical and clinical questions—questions that are more easily resolved in the case of palliative sedation for pain and physical symptoms than for depression and psychosocial symptoms.</Para><Para id="_69">For example, the ethical basis for the use of terminal sedation (double effect) is less clearly applicable in the case of psychiatric symptoms. Under the principle of double effect, the intended effect (relieving psychological suffering) would be considered allowable as long as any risks or negative effects (i.e., shortened survival) are unintended by the health care professional. The difficulty arises because the principle only discusses the professional’s intention, when it is the patient’s intention that can be unclear and potentially problematic. Is the depressed patient who no longer wants to suffer depressive symptoms asking only for that relief, or does the patient also intend to ask the professional to shorten his or her life? A clinician who feels uncomfortable in such situations may wish to seek guidance from his or her ethics committee.</Para><Para id="_70">Other difficult questions can arise from the potentially negative value that is culturally assigned to detaching oneself, or “zoning out,” as a lower form of coping. Should the anxious patient who no longer wants to face the anxiety associated with the end of life and who wants to be sedated be encouraged to work through such issues? Or is it allowable for these patients to have sedation for dealing with their anxiety? How many alternatives should be tried before anxiety is considered unacceptable? When dealing with such requests, professionals should consider their own cultural and religious biases and the cultural and/or religious backgrounds of patients and their families.</Para><Para id="_71">Few studies detail the use of terminal sedation for psychosocial symptoms. Four palliative care programs in Israel, South Africa, and Spain participated in one survey.<Reference refidx="1"/> One unique study has described the Japanese experience around the issues of palliative sedation therapy.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] A retrospective study at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston included 1,207 patients admitted to the palliative care unit.

children.  One study of children seen in a general practice showed that 38% had
problems that required major intervention by a psychiatrist.  Another study
of children aged 7 to 12 years showed a 1.9% incidence of depression.  If
applied to the general population of the United States, these results show that
40,000 12-year-olds are depressed.  Teachers have estimated that as many as 10%
to 15% of their students are depressed.  The Joint Commission on Mental Health
of Children states that 1.4 million children younger than 18 years need immediate help
for disorders such as depression; only one-third of these children receive help
for their disorder.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_245">Most children cope with the emotional upheaval related to cancer and
demonstrate not only evidence of adaptation but positive psychosocial growth
and development.  A minority of children, however, develops psychological problems
including depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, difficulties in
interpersonal relationships, and noncompliance with treatment.  These children
require referral and intervention by a mental health specialist.<Reference refidx="2"/>
</Para><Para id="_246">In one of the first studies of depression in childhood cancer, 114 children and
adolescents were studied, and 59% were found to have mild psychiatric
problems.<Reference refidx="3"/>  A study of 17 adolescent and 21 pediatric oncology patients, all
of whom were administered a self-report psychosocial life events inventory,
showed that the adolescent samples had a mean level of depressive symptoms
similar to that of the general population.  The pediatric oncology sample
demonstrated significantly lower depressive symptoms than the general
population.<Reference refidx="4"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]  Forty-one adolescent survivors of childhood cancer were
assessed using questionnaires and interviews to determine the psychosocial
status of the survivors; most survivors were functioning well, and depression
was rare.<Reference refidx="5"/>  A study of long-term cancer survivors and their mothers,
comparing the survivors with a group of 92 healthy children, showed that the
majority of former patients were functioning within normal limits.  Not
surprisingly, children with severe late effects had more depressive
symptoms.<Reference refidx="6"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]  One researcher looked at the characteristics of psychiatric
consultations in a pediatric cancer center and found that adjustment disorder
was the chief psychosocial diagnosis.  This finding is similar to results
obtained from adult cancer patients.  This study also found that anxiety
reactions were more common in the younger pediatric patients and depressive
disorders were more common in older patients.<Reference refidx="7"/>  In a study conducted in 1988
with a sample of 30 adolescent cancer patients, the rate of major depression
was not greater than the rate for the population at large.<Reference refidx="8"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]  One review
reported a 17% incidence of depression using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, 3rd Edition criteria.<Reference refidx="9"/>
</Para><Para id="_247">Most cancer survivors demonstrate general resiliency and successful
psychological adjustment to the disease and its treatment.  Despite evidence
for successful adaptation, most studies document psychological difficulties in
a significant subset of cancer survivors.
</Para><SummarySection id="_248"><Title>Assessment and Diagnosis of Pediatric Depression</Title><SummarySection id="_249"><Title>Assessment</Title><Para id="_250">The term depression refers to a symptom, a syndrome, a set of psychological
responses, or to an illness.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Duration and intensity of the behavioral
manifestation (e.g., sadness) differentiates the symptoms from the disorder. 
For example, a sad affect can be a child's response to trauma and is usually
of short duration; however, a depressive illness is characterized by long
duration, and is associated with insomnia, irritability, changes in eating
habits, and severe impairment of the child's scholastic and social adjustment. 
Depression should be considered whenever any behavior problem persists. 
Depression does not refer to transitory moments of sadness, but rather to a
disorder that affects development and interferes with realization of the
child's innate potential.<Reference refidx="1"/>
</Para><Para id="_251">Some manifestations of depression in a school-aged child include anorexia,
lethargy, sad affect, aggression, weeping, hyperactivity, somatization, fear of
death, frustration, feelings of sadness or hopelessness, self criticism,
frequent day dreaming, low self-esteem, school refusal, learning problems, slow
movements, vacillating hostility towards parents and teachers, and loss of
interest in previously pleasurable activities.  Differentiating these symptoms
from behavioral responses to normal developmental stages is important.<Reference refidx="1"/>
</Para><Para id="_252">Assessment of depression includes  determination of the child's family
situation, level of emotional maturity, ability to
cope with illness and treatment, age, state of development,  previous experience with illness, and personal ego strength.<Reference refidx="10"/>
</Para><Para id="_253">A comprehensive assessment for childhood depression is the basis for accurate
diagnosis and treatment.  Evaluation of the child and family situation focuses
on  the pediatric health history,  behaviors observed by the
practitioner or reported by others (e.g., parents, teachers),  interviews
with the child, and  judicial use of tests such as the Beck Depression
Inventory or the Child Behavior Checklist.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_254"><Title>Diagnosis</Title><Para id="_255">In discussing the diagnosis of childhood depression, experts stress the
importance of understanding childhood depression as an entity distinct from
depression in adults.  This is due to the fact that developmental issues in
childhood are distinctly different from those of adulthood.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_256">A model of childhood affective disorders uses the following explicit criteria:<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_282" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Dysphoric mood (children younger than 6 years must also have a sad

models, etiology, and manifestations of the disorder.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Individual and group
psychotherapy are commonly utilized as the primary treatment modality and are
directed at helping the child to master his or her difficulties and to enable
the child to develop in an optimal manner.  Play therapy may be used as a means
of exploring a younger child's view of himself or herself, the disease, and its
treatment.  The child needs to be helped from the beginning to explore and
understand, at a level appropriate for his or her developmental age, the
diagnosis of cancer and the treatments involved.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><SummarySection id="_259"><Title>Pharmacologic management</Title><Para id="_260">As is the case with depression in adult cancer patients, there are few, if any,
revealing trials of antidepressants in children with cancer.  One author
described rapid clinical response to low doses (&lt;2 mg/kg/d)
of imipramine or amitriptyline for eight depressed children with cancer.<Reference refidx="13"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663087">Level of evidence: III</LOERef>] 
Another author described the use of benzodiazepines such as lorazepam,
diazepam, alprazolam, and clonazepam for the treatment of anxiety disorders. 
Trials of benzodiazepines should be short term.  These drugs should be tapered
slowly when they are discontinued.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para><Para id="_261">The combined use of tricyclic antidepressants and neuroleptics in the
management of three children with severe symptoms of depression and anxiety has
been reported.  The children studied were in the terminal phases of their
