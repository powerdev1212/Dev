The most recent estimated mortality rate (from 2007 to 2011) was 2.5 per 100,000 persons per year. U.S. incidence and mortality rates are about 2.5 and 2.8 times higher, respectively, in men than in women.<Reference refidx="1"/> It is
estimated that there will be 45,780 new cases of oral cancer diagnosed in the United States in 2015 and  8,650 deaths due to this disease.<Reference refidx="2"/> The estimated age-standardized (World Standard Population) worldwide incidence and mortality rates of oropharyngeal cancer in 2008 were 5.9 and 3.3 per 100,000 persons per year, respectively.<Reference refidx="3"/> Primarily because of differences in tobacco and alcohol use, rates vary widely across the world.<Reference refidx="4"/> South central Asia and Melanesia have particularly high rates of oral cancer attributable to betel quid chewing.</Para><Para id="_160">Oral cancer can be divided into three clinicopathological categories: carcinoma of the lip vermillion, carcinoma of the oral cavity proper, and carcinoma of the oropharynx. </Para><Para id="_161">Squamous cell carcinoma, which arises from the oral mucosal lining, accounts for more than 90% of the tumors in the oral cavity and oropharynx. Other types of primary tumors arising in this area include lymphoma, sarcoma, melanoma, and minor salivary gland tumors. In the Western world, the most common locations of tumor development are the tongue and floor of the mouth; however, in parts of the world where tobacco or betel quid chewing is prominent, cancers of the retromolar trigone and buccal mucosa are common. Oral squamous cell carcinomas are sometimes preceded by oral preneoplastic lesions, which are often present as visible alterations of the mucosal surface and include leukoplakia and erythroplakia.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_162">The most important factor affecting long-term outcome after treatment is the stage of disease at diagnosis; however, overall outcome is stage and site dependent. Although early-stage tumors (without lymph node involvement) have an excellent anticipated 5-year survival rate (about 82%), the 5-year survival rates for patients with regional lymph node spread or metastases are only about 56% and 34%, respectively.<Reference refidx="6"/> Some or all of the differences in prognosis among disease stages may result from lead-time  bias rather than a benefit of early detection and treatment.
