The quality and reliability of such published reports can vary considerably. To help readers assess the strength of findings from clinical research studies, levels-of-evidence rankings are often employed. These rankings generally take into account the strength of a study’s design and the strength of the clinical outcome(s) measured. Clinical research in supportive and palliative care is feasible in some settings but difficult to conduct in others, such as at the end of life. Furthermore, as in other areas of medicine, supportive and palliative care decisions must be made in the context of existing evidence, which may be weaker than ideal.</Para><Para id="_13">In general, the quality of evidence depends on:</Para><ItemizedList id="_17" Style="bullet"><ListItem> The appropriateness of the study to the question being asked.</ListItem><ListItem>How well the study was designed, implemented, analyzed, and interpreted.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_18">For evaluating outcomes of both medical and psychosocial interventions, the strongest evidence is obtained from well-designed, well-conducted randomized clinical trials. For evaluating other questions, particularly those related to symptom management, well-designed descriptive studies may provide the strongest evidence practicable. Particular elements of study design, such as the nature of the population being studied or the duration of observation, may be crucial to assessing the quality of a study. Reviews of studies will indicate the level of evidence and any confounding design issues.</Para><Para id="_14">During the early phases of research in a new area, information relevant to the needs of patients and clinicians may come from a limited number of reports and data of varying strength. This information may include evidence from:</Para><ItemizedList id="_19" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Well-designed prospective studies (e.g., randomized trials, nonrandomized trials, cohort studies, and case series).</ListItem><ListItem>Cross-sectional studies (e.g., correlational designs using various levels of analytic sophistication).</ListItem><ListItem>Retrospective studies (e.g., case-control studies, case series, and case reports).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_20">The studies may be interventional, may be observational, or may involve provider or patient self-reports or record reviews.</Para><Para id="_16">In some cases, the best available evidence may reflect clinical/professional experience or expert consensus opinion. All sources may yield information relevant to patients and clinicians, who may be required to make management decisions before the best possible evidence is available.</Para><Para id="_21">In view of this complexity, the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/supportive-care">PDQ Supportive and Palliative Care Editorial Board</ExternalRef> took a pragmatic approach to defining the levels of evidence that it would utilize. The levels used by the Board focus primarily on the strength of a study’s design as appropriate to the questions being investigated. These levels should be easily understood by health professionals and serve as a starting point for discussing the strength of study results.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_3"><Title>Study Design Categories, Definitions, and Levels of Evidence</Title><OrderedList id="_22" Style="URoman" Compact="No"><ListItem><Strong>Prospective, randomized, controlled trials and meta-analyses of prospective, randomized, controlled trials.</Strong><Para id="_23">The randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial is the gold standard of study design. To achieve this ranking, the study allocation must be blinded to the investigator both before and after the randomization and the assignment to intervention group. This design provides protection from allocation bias by the investigator and from bias in the assessment of outcomes by both the investigator and the patient.</Para><Para id="_24">Unfortunately, double-blinding after intervention assignment is not always possible because procedures or side effects often vary substantially among study interventions in ways that are obvious to both the investigator and the patient. In some cases, however, it should be possible to blind the investigator and the patient until the randomization has been made, even if intervention delivery cannot be blinded. Furthermore, randomized trials are still subject to imbalances if sample size is inadequate to the question of interest, and may be less than optimal owing to other design elements such as choice of sample, measurement approach, appropriateness of the comparison condition, or loss to follow-up.</Para><Para id="_25">Meta-analysis of randomized studies offers a quantitative synthesis of previously conducted studies. The strength of the evidence from a meta-analysis is based on the quality of the individual studies included. Moreover, meta-analyses can magnify small systematic errors in individual studies.</Para><Para id="_26">Because the results of meta-analyses and the randomized trials upon which they are based do not always agree and because meta-analyses performed by different investigators to address the same issue can reach contradictory conclusions, meta-analyses of randomized studies are placed in the same category of strength of evidence as are randomized studies, not at a higher level.</Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Prospective, nonrandomized, controlled trials; prospective cohort studies; prospective case series; and cross-sectional studies.</Strong><Para id="_27">In nonrandomized controlled trials, allocation to intervention group is made on the basis of:</Para><ItemizedList id="_28" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Birth date.</ListItem><ListItem>Chart number.</ListItem><ListItem>Bed availability.</ListItem><ListItem>Day of clinic appointment.</ListItem><ListItem>Any other strategy known to the investigator before informed consent is obtained from the patient.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_29">Imbalances can occur in intervention allocations under such circumstances but can also be taken into account statistically.</Para><Para id="_30">A prospective cohort study is a longitudinal study in which a defined group of individuals who share a certain condition and/or who are exposed to a particular intervention are followed over time and compared with another group of individuals who are not exposed to the intervention under study. The general population from which the cohort is drawn or another cohort can be used as the comparison group. Alternatively, subgroups within a cohort can be compared with each other.</Para><Para id="_31">A prospective case series is an uncontrolled study involving either consecutive cases or nonconsecutive cases. Although the evidence from this type of study is weaker than that from a controlled study, this design may be the only one practical in certain settings. Evidence from a consecutive case series is considered stronger than that from a nonconsecutive case series, and population-based series drawn from a well-defined population are stronger than non–population-based series.</Para><Para id="_32">Cross-sectional/correlational studies are widely used to investigate the relationship among variables in one or more groups of individuals. Depending on the research question, they may be the highest level of design possible and may even be the most appropriate to examine the relationships among multiple variables. Analytic strategies, including multivariate approaches, need to be matched to the question at issue. A combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal data collection can be explored with very sophisticated path analytic approaches, with the imputation of causality. Quality can nevertheless vary considerably, depending on:</Para><ItemizedList id="_33" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Choice of measurement.</ListItem><ListItem>Adequacy of sample size.</ListItem><ListItem>Representativeness of sample.</ListItem><ListItem>Quality of statistical analysis.</ListItem></ItemizedList></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Retrospective studies.</Strong><Para id="_34">Retrospective studies include:</Para><ItemizedList id="_35" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Case-control studies.</ListItem><ListItem>Retrospective case studies.</ListItem><ListItem>Individual case reports.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_36">In case-control studies, two groups of individuals—one with a disease or condition (cases) and a similar group without the disease or condition (controls)—are compared. The cases should be representative of all cases in a population but do not have to include all cases in a population. The controls should come from the same population as the cases.</Para><Para id="_37">Retrospective studies are prone to numerous biases, including selection bias and lack of information about confounding variables from medical records or memories of the study participants (recall bias). Incident cases are preferable to prevalent cases to help reduce bias.</Para><Para id="_38">Evidence obtained from retrospective studies, especially case reports, is among the weakest forms of evidence. However, systematic qualitative research, while often retrospective in nature, improves substantially on anecdotal case reports.</Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Opinions of respected authorities based on clinical experience, consensus statements from expert committees, or authoritative reviews.</Strong><Para id="_39">The evidence supporting conclusions or recommendations in opinions, consensus statements, or authoritative reviews can be highly variable and subject to important biases. This category of evidence is usually considered the lowest in many levels-of-evidence rankings.</Para></ListItem></OrderedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_5"><SectMetaData><SectionType>Changes to summary</SectionType></SectMetaData><Title>Changes to This Summary (06/17/2015)</Title><Para id="_41">The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as
