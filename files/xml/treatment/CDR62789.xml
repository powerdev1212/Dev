cancer need to be referred to medical centers that have multidisciplinary teams
of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during
childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates
the skills of the primary care physician, pediatric surgical subspecialists,
radiation oncologists, pediatric medical oncologists/hematologists,
rehabilitation specialists, pediatric nurse specialists, social workers, and
others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and
rehabilitation that will achieve optimal survival and quality of life. (Refer to the PDQ <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/supportive-care">Supportive and Palliative Care</ExternalRef> summaries for more information.) 
</Para><Para id="_757">Guidelines for pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of
pediatric patients with cancer have been outlined by the American Academy of
Pediatrics.<Reference refidx="2"/>  At these pediatric cancer centers, clinical trials are
available for most of the types of cancer that occur in children and
adolescents, and the opportunity to participate in these trials is offered to
most patients/families.  Clinical trials for children and adolescents with
cancer are generally designed to compare potentially better therapy with
therapy that is currently accepted as standard.  Most of the progress
made in identifying curative therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved
through clinical trials under the auspices of cooperative groups such as the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.childrensoncologygroup.org">Children's Oncology Group</ExternalRef> (COG), the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cclg.org.uk/">Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group</ExternalRef> (CCLG), and the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.siop-online.org/">Société Internationale d’Oncologie Pédiatrique</ExternalRef> (SIOP).  Information about ongoing clinical trials is
available from the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials">NCI website</ExternalRef>. </Para><Para id="_758">Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2010, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.<Reference refidx="3"/> For children younger than 15 years with Wilms tumor, the 5-year survival rate has increased over the same time from 74% to 88%.<Reference refidx="3"/> Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because cancer therapy side effects may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000343584" url="/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq"> Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer</SummaryRef> for specific information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors.)</Para><Para id="_759">Childhood kidney cancers account for about 7% of all childhood cancers. Most  childhood kidney cancers are Wilms tumor, but in the 15- to 19-year age group, most tumors are renal cell carcinoma. Wilms tumor can affect one kidney (unilateral) or both kidneys (bilateral). Other types of childhood kidney tumors include rhabdoid tumors, clear cell sarcoma, congenital mesoblastic nephroma, neuroepithelial tumors, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, cystic partially differentiated nephroblastoma, multilocular cystic nephroma, primary renal synovial sarcoma, and anaplastic sarcoma. Nephroblastomatosis of the kidney is a type of nonmalignant neoplasia.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/></Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="20404250">Smith MA, Seibel NL, Altekruse SF, et al.: Outcomes for children and adolescents with cancer: challenges for the twenty-first century.

A planned attempt at resection or biopsy of apparently unresectable tumor is undertaken no later than 12 weeks from diagnosis. Continuing therapy without evaluating tumor pathology in a patient with bilateral Wilms tumor may miss anaplastic histology or chemotherapy-induced differentiation (including rhabdomyomatous differentiation) and thus increase toxicity for the patient without providing additional benefit for tumor control.

The sites of metastases were the lungs, liver, and lymph nodes. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were each about 55% at 20 years posttreatment.

In this series, 33% of the patients had papillary subtype, 22% had translocation type, 16% were unclassified, and 6% had clear-cell subtype.
