This can help find cancer at an early <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045885">stage</GlossaryTermRef>. When <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044636">abnormal</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissue</GlossaryTermRef> or cancer is found early, it may be easier to treat. By the time symptoms appear, cancer may have begun to spread.</Para><Para id="_3"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044724">Scientists</GlossaryTermRef> are trying to better understand which people are more likely to get certain types of cancer. They also study the things we do and the things around us to see if they cause cancer. This information helps doctors recommend who should be screened for cancer, which screening tests should be used, and how often the tests should be done.</Para><Para id="_4">It is important to remember that your doctor does not necessarily think you have cancer if he or she suggests a screening test. Screening tests are given when you have no cancer symptoms.</Para><Para id="_5">If a screening test result is abnormal, you may need to have more tests done to find out if you have cancer. These are called <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045959">diagnostic tests</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_8"><Title>General Information About Neuroblastoma Cancer</Title><SummarySection id="_9"><SectMetaData><SectionType>Cancer description</SectionType><SectionType>Organ description</SectionType></SectMetaData><KeyPoint id="_10">Neuroblastoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in nerve tissue.</KeyPoint><Para id="_11"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045418">Neuroblastoma</GlossaryTermRef> often begins in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000373935">nerve</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissue</GlossaryTermRef> of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046678">adrenal glands</GlossaryTermRef>.

The adrenal glands make important <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045713">hormones</GlossaryTermRef> that help control heart rate, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462668">blood pressure</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000658770">blood sugar</GlossaryTermRef>, and the way the body reacts to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000450122">stress</GlossaryTermRef>. Neuroblastoma may also begin in the abdomen,  chest, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000340937">spinal cord</GlossaryTermRef>, or in nerve tissue near the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000415914">spine</GlossaryTermRef> in the neck.</Para><MediaLink ref="CDR0000756627" type="image/jpeg" alt="Drawing shows parts of the body where neuroblastoma may be found, including the paraspinal nerve tissue and the adrenal glands.

</KeyPoint><Para id="_57">Neuroblastoma is the most common type of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef> in infants.  The number of new
cases of neuroblastoma is greatest among children under 1 year of age. As children get older, the number of new cases 
decreases.  Neuroblastoma is slightly more common in males  than
females.
</Para><Para id="_14">Neuroblastoma sometimes forms before birth but is usually found later, when the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumor</GlossaryTermRef> begins to grow and cause <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045022">symptoms</GlossaryTermRef>.

Other tests are used because they have been shown to find cancer in some people; however, it has not been proven in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045961">clinical trials</GlossaryTermRef> that use of these tests will decrease the risk of dying from cancer.</Para><Para id="_23"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044724">Scientists</GlossaryTermRef> study screening tests to find those with the fewest risks and most benefits. Cancer screening trials also are meant to show whether early detection (finding cancer before it causes <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045022">symptoms</GlossaryTermRef>) decreases a person's chance of dying from the disease. For some types of cancer, the chance of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454708">recovery</GlossaryTermRef> is better if the disease is found and treated at an early <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045885">stage</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para><Para id="_24">Clinical trials that study cancer screening methods are taking place in many parts of the country.

A  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046642">urine</GlossaryTermRef> test is sometimes used  to check for  neuroblastoma,  usually when the child is 6 months old. This is a test in which urine is collected for 24 hours to measure the amounts of certain substances. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000257523">organ</GlossaryTermRef> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissue</GlossaryTermRef> that makes it. A higher than normal amount of homovanillic acid (HMA) and vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA) may be a sign of neuroblastoma. 
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_62"><KeyPoint id="_63">Screening for neuroblastoma may not help the child live longer.</KeyPoint><Para id="_61">Studies have shown  that  screening for neuroblastoma does not decrease  the chance of dying from the
disease. Almost all neuroblastomas that are found by screening children at 6 months of age are the type that have a good <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045849">prognosis</GlossaryTermRef> (chance of recovery).

Not all screening tests are helpful and most have risks. Before having any screening test, you may want to discuss the test with your doctor. It is important to know the risks of the test and whether it has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_46"><KeyPoint id="_47">The risks of neuroblastoma screening include the following:</KeyPoint><SummarySection id="_59"><KeyPoint id="_60"> Neuroblastoma may be overdiagnosed.</KeyPoint><Para id="_64"> When a screening test result leads to the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046450">diagnosis</GlossaryTermRef> and treatment of a disease that may never have caused <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045022">symptoms</GlossaryTermRef> or become life-threatening, it is called <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000759894">overdiagnosis</GlossaryTermRef>. For example, when a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046642">urine</GlossaryTermRef> test result shows a higher than normal amount of homovanillic acid (HMA) or vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA), tests and treatments for <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045418">neuroblastoma</GlossaryTermRef> are likely to be done, but may not be needed. At this time, it is not possible to know which neuroblastomas found by a screening test will cause symptoms and which neuroblastomas will not. <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045959">Diagnostic tests</GlossaryTermRef> (such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045164">biopsies</GlossaryTermRef>) and cancer treatments (such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045570">surgery</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044971">radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef>, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045214">chemotherapy</GlossaryTermRef>) can have serious risks, including physical and emotional problems.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_48"><KeyPoint id="_49">False-negative test results can occur.</KeyPoint><Para id="_50">Screening test results may appear to be normal even though neuroblastoma is present.

The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/espanol/recursos/pdq">Spanish</ExternalRef>.</Para><Para id="_AboutThis_4">PDQ is a service of the NCI.

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_AboutThis_10"><Title>Clinical Trial Information</Title><Para id="_AboutThis_11">A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
