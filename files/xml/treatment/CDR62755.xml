Screening tests are able to detect prostate cancer at an early stage, but it is not clear whether this earlier detection and consequent earlier treatment leads to any change in the natural history and outcome of the disease.   Observational evidence shows a trend toward lower mortality for prostate cancer in some countries, but the relationship between these trends and intensity of screening is not clear, and associations with screening patterns are inconsistent.  The observed trends may be due to screening, or to  other factors such as improved treatment.<Reference refidx="1"/> Results from two randomized trials show no effect on mortality through 7   years but  are inconsistent beyond 7 to 10 years.</Para><ItemizedList id="_133" Style="bullet"><ListTitle>Description of the Evidence</ListTitle><ListItem><Strong>Study  Design</Strong>: Evidence obtained from observational and descriptive studies (e.g., international patterns studies, time series).</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Internal Validity</Strong>: Fair.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Consistency</Strong>: Poor.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Magnitude of Effects on Health Outcomes</Strong>: Uncertain.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>External Validity</Strong>: Poor.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_103"><Title>Harms</Title><Para id="_104">Based on  solid evidence, screening with PSA and/or DRE detects some prostate cancers that would never have caused important clinical problems.

It is estimated that in 2015, approximately 220,800
new cases and 27,540 prostate cancer-related deaths will occur in the United
States.<Reference refidx="1"/>                                                                        Prostate cancer is now the second leading cause of cancer death in
men, exceeded only by lung cancer.  It accounts for 26% of all male cancers and
9% of male cancer-related deaths.<Reference refidx="1"/> Age-adjusted incidence rates increased
steadily over the past several decades, with particularly dramatic increases associated with
the inception of widespread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in the late
1980s and early 1990s, followed by a more recent fall in incidence. Between 2007 and 2011, mortality rates decreased by 3.2% per year.<Reference refidx="1"/>  It has been suggested
 that declines in mortality rates in certain jurisdictions reflect the
benefit of PSA screening,<Reference refidx="2"/> but others  have noted that these
observations may be explained by independent phenomena such as improved
treatment effects. 
</Para><Para id="_10">Regional differences have been observed in prostate cancer  incidence and mortality rates and in rates of radical prostatectomy.  Until 1989, the increased
incidence  was most likely the result of increased tumor detection due to increasing rates of transurethral prostatectomy.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/>  Subsequent
increases were most likely the result of  widespread use of PSA testing  for early detection and
screening.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>  Variable incidence rates may reflect variability in the
intensity of early detection practices across the United States and other
jurisdictions.  While differences in aggregate mortality by regions of the
United States have not been observed, considerable variation in mortality rates
between African American and white men are seen.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> (Refer to the  <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062755#_67" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-screening-pdq">Population Observations on Early Detection, Incidence, and Prostate Cancer Mortality </SummaryRef> section  of this summary for more information.)</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_11"><Title>Risk Factors</Title><Para id="_12">Prostate cancer is uncommonly seen in men younger than 50 years; the
incidence rises rapidly with each decade thereafter.  The incidence rate is higher in African American men than in white men. From 2005 to 2009, the overall age-adjusted incidence rate  was 236 per 100,000 for African American men and 146.9 per 100,000 for white men.<Reference refidx="9"/> African American males have a higher
mortality from prostate cancer, even after attempts to adjust for 
access-to-care factors.<Reference refidx="10"/>  Men with a family history of prostate cancer are
at an increased risk of the disease compared with men without this history.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/> 
Other potential risk factors besides age, race, and family history of prostate
cancer include alcohol consumption, vitamin or mineral interactions, and other
dietary habits.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/>  A significant body of evidence suggests that a diet high in fat, especially saturated fats and fats of animal origin, is associated  with a higher risk of prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/>  Other possible dietary influences include selenium, vitamin E, vitamin D, lycopene, and isoflavones.  (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062833" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-prevention-pdq"> Prostate
Cancer                        Prevention</SummaryRef>                        for more information.)  Evidence from a nested case-control study within the
Physicians’ Health Study,<Reference refidx="20"/> in addition to a case-control study <Reference refidx="21"/> and a retrospective review of screened prostate cancer patients,<Reference refidx="22"/>  suggests that higher plasma insulin-like growth
factor-I levels may be associated with a higher prostate cancer risk.<Reference refidx="23"/> Not all studies, however, have confirmed this association.<Reference refidx="24"/>
The estimated lifetime risk of diagnosis of prostate cancer is about  16.5%,<Reference refidx="25"/> and the lifetime risk of dying from this disease is 2.8%.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para><Para id="_13">The biology and natural history of prostate cancer is not completely understood. Rigorous evaluation of any prostate cancer screening modality is desirable because the natural history of the disease is variable, and appropriate treatment is not clearly defined. Although the prevalence of prostate cancer and preneoplastic lesions found at
autopsy steadily increases for each decade of age, most of these lesions remain
clinically undetected.<Reference refidx="27"/>  
 An autopsy study of white and Asian men also found an increase in occult prostate cancer with age, reaching nearly 60% in men older than 80 years. More than 50% of cancers in Asian men and 25% of cancers in white men had a Gleason score of 7 or greater, suggesting that Gleason score may be an imprecise indicator of clinically insignificant prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="28"/> </Para><Para id="_14">  There is an association between primary tumor volume and
local extent of disease, progression, and survival.<Reference refidx="29"/>  A review of a large
number of prostate cancers in radical prostatectomy, cystectomy, and autopsy
specimens showed that capsular penetration, seminal vesicle invasion, and lymph
node metastases were usually found only with tumors larger than 1.4 cc.<Reference refidx="30"/> 
Furthermore, the semiquantitative histopathologic grading scheme proposed by
Gleason is reasonably reproducible among pathologists and correlates with the
incidence of nodal metastases and with patient survival in a number of reported
studies.<Reference refidx="31"/>
</Para><Para id="_15">Cancer statistics from the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer
Institute indicated  that between 2002 and 2008,  the proportion of disease diagnosed at a
locoregional stage and at a distant stage was 93% and 4% for whites, compared with  91%
and 6% for African Americans, respectively.<Reference refidx="9"/>  Stage distribution of prostate cancer is affected
substantially by the intensity of early detection efforts.</Para><Para id="_16">Pathologic stage does not always reflect clinical stage and upstaging (owing
either to extracapsular extension, positive margins, seminal vesicle invasion, or
lymph node involvement) occurs frequently.  Of the prostate cancers detected by
digital rectal exam (DRE) in the pre-PSA era, 67% to 88% were at a
clinically localized stage (T1–2, NX, M0 [T = tumor size, N = lymph node involvement, and M = metastasis]).<Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/>  However, in one of those series
of 2,002 patients undergoing annual screening  DRE, only
one-third of men proved to have pathologically organ-confined disease.<Reference refidx="33"/>
</Para><Para id="_17">With the proliferation of PSA for early detection, reviews of large numbers of
asymptomatic men with prostate cancer found that most  have organ-confined disease.  One study found
that 63% of cancers detected in men undergoing their first screening PSA were
pathologically organ-confined cancers; the percentage increased to 71% if
cancer was detected on a subsequent examination.<Reference refidx="34"/>  In a series of 2,999 men
undergoing screening with PSA, DRE, and transrectal ultrasound, 62% of the
tumors detected were reported to be pathologically organ-confined.<Reference refidx="35"/>  While
the proportion of node-positive cancers in the pre-PSA era were in the range of
25% for patients with ostensibly localized disease, current series report
proportions as low as 3%.<Reference refidx="36"/>  Stage T1c tumors detected by serial PSA and
removed by radical prostatectomy are organ-confined in 79% of cases.<Reference refidx="37"/>
</Para><Para id="_18">Survival rates for prostate cancer have improved from 1974 to the present. 
Lead-time and length-bias effects of early detection and the possible influence
of stage migration must also be considered when trends in survival
data are interpreted.<Reference refidx="38"/>  Reported survival rates may also vary, depending on whether the analytical methods reflect crude disease-specific rates (absolute
disease-specific survival) or take into account competing risks for the given
age group (relative disease-specific survival).

traditionally used for prostate cancer screening.  Two other procedures are also available: transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Prostate cancer screening is controversial
because of the lack of definitive evidence of benefit.  A small randomized trial in Sweden evaluated the effects of screening men aged 50 to 69 years every 3 years; the first two screenings included DRE only, followed by two screenings with DRE combined with a test for PSA. The trial was not powered to detect even moderate differences in prostate cancer mortality, which was the same in the two groups: 1.3% (20 of 1,494 patients) for men assigned to screening and 1.3% (97 of 7,532 patients) for controls.<Reference refidx="2"/>
The controversy persists. A nested case-control study was conducted at ten U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers in New England (71,661 patients receiving ambulatory care between 1989 and 1990), identifying 501 patients who were diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate from 1991 to 1995 and who died between 1991 and 1999. Controls were selected from among patients living at the time case patients died (matched 1:1 for age and VA facility). A benefit from screening by PSA or PSA and/or DRE was not found for PSA (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71–1.64; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> =  .72) or for PSA and/or DRE (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.63–2.06; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .68).  Because prostate cancer has a relatively slow course, it is possible that the relatively short follow-up period in this study precluded the observation of a benefit, which might accrue only after 10 or more years from the time of screening.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_139">Adding to the controversy
is the lack of consensus regarding optimal treatment of localized disease and
the clear evidence that active treatment options are associated with
significant morbidity.  Treatment options for early-stage disease include
radical prostatectomy, definitive radiation therapy, and watchful waiting (no
immediate treatment; treatment if indications of progression are present,   but treatment not designed with curative intent).  Multiple series from various years and institutions have been
reported on the outcomes of patients with localized prostate cancer who
received no treatment but were followed with surveillance alone.  Outcomes have
also been reported for active treatments, but valid comparisons of efficacy
between surgery, radiation, and watchful waiting are seldom
possible because of differences in reporting and selection factors in the
various reported series. A randomized trial in Scandinavian men published in 2002 explored the benefit of radical prostatectomy over watchful waiting in men with newly diagnosed, well-differentiated, or moderately well-differentiated prostate cancers of clinical stages T1b, T1c, or T2.<Reference refidx="4"/>  Six hundred ninety-eight men younger than 75 years, most with clinically detected rather than screen-detected cancers (unlike most newly diagnosed patients in North America) were randomly assigned to the two-arm trial. After 5 years of follow-up, the difference in prostate cancer-specific mortality between radical prostatectomy and watchful waiting groups was 2%; after 10 years of follow-up, the difference was 5.3% (relative risk [RR], 0.56 [0.36–0.88]). There was also a difference of about 5% in all-cause mortality that was apparent only after 10 years of follow-up (RR, 0.74 [0.56–0.99]). Thus, to extend one life, 20 men with palpable, clinically localized prostate cancer would need to undergo radical prostatectomy rather than watchful waiting.  Because most prostate cancers that are detected today with PSA screening are not palpable, this study may not be directly generalizable to the average newly diagnosed patient in the United States.<Reference refidx="5"/> </Para><Para id="_254">A Swedish retrospective study of a nationwide cohort of patients with localized prostate cancer aged 70 years or younger reported that 10-year prostate cancer-specific mortality was 2.4% among men diagnosed with clinically local stage T1a, T1b, or T1c, with a serum PSA of less than 10 ng/mL, and with a Gleason score of 2 to 6, referred to as low-risk cases, of which there were 2,686.<Reference refidx="6"/>  This subgroup analysis was derived from a cohort study of 6,849 men diagnosed between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2002, aged 70 years or younger, who had local stage T1 to T2 with no signs of lymph node metastases or bone metastases, and a PSA serum level of less than 20 ng/mL, as was  abstracted from the Swedish Cancer Registry, which captured 98% of solid tumors among men aged 75 years or younger.  Cohort treatment options were surveillance (n = 2,021) or curative intent by radical prostatectomy (n = 3,399) or radiation therapy (n = 1,429), which were to be determined at the discretion of treating physicians.  Surveillance or expectancy treatment was either active surveillance with curative treatment if progression occurred or watchful waiting—a strategy for administering hormonal treatment upon symptomatic progression.  Using all-cause mortality as the benchmark, the study calculated cumulative incidence mortality for the three treatment groups of the entire cohort and the low-risk subgroup.  Surveillance was more common among men with high comorbidity and among men with low-risk tumors.  The 10-year cumulative risk of death from prostate cancer for the entire 6,849 person cohort was 3.6% in the surveillance group and 2.7% in the curative-intent group compared with the low-risk surveillance group (2.4%) and the low-risk curative-intent group (0.7%).  Biases inherent in treatment assignment could not be accounted for adequately in the analysis, which prevented conclusions about the relative effectiveness of alternative treatments. However, a 10-year prostate cancer-specific mortality of 2.4% among patients with low-risk prostate cancer in the surveillance group suggested that surveillance may be a suitable treatment for many patients with low-risk disease compared with the 19.2% 10-year risk of death from competing causes observed in the surveillance group and 10.2% in the curative-intent group of the total 6,849 person cohort.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><SummarySection id="_22"><Title>Digital Rectal Exam</Title><Para id="_23">Although DRE has been used for many years, careful evaluation of this modality

patients with a palpable abnormality in the prostate agreed to undergo biopsy. 
The positive predictive value (PPV) of a palpable nodule, i.e., prostate cancer on
biopsy, was 29% (11 of 38).  Further evaluation revealed that 45% of the cases
were stage B, 36% were stage C, and 18% were stage D.  More results from the
same investigators revealed a 25% PPV, with 68% of the
detected tumors clinically localized but only approximately 30% pathologically
localized after radical prostatectomy.<Reference refidx="10"/>  Some investigators reported a high proportion of clinically localized disease when prostate cancer

with annual rectal examination, only 20% of cases are localized at
diagnosis.<Reference refidx="12"/>  It has been reported that 25% of men
presenting with metastatic disease had a normal prostate examination.<Reference refidx="13"/>
Another case-control study examining screening with both DRE and PSA found a reduction in prostate cancer mortality that was not statistically significant (OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.46–1.1). Most men in this study were screened with DRE rather than PSA.<Reference refidx="14"/> All four of these case-control studies are consistent with a reduction of 20% to 30% in prostate cancer mortality. Potential biases inherent in this study design, however, limit the ability to draw conclusions on the basis of this evidence alone.</Para><Para id="_25">Since PSA assays became widely available in the late 1980s, DRE alone is rarely discussed as a screening modality.  A number of studies have found that DRE has a poor predictive value for
prostate cancer if PSA is at very low levels.  In the European Study on
Screening for Prostate Cancer,  it was found that if DRE is used only for a
PSA higher than 1.5 ng/mL (thus, no DRE is performed with PSA &lt; 1.5 ng/mL), 29% of all
biopsies would be eliminated while maintaining a 95% prostate cancer detection
sensitivity.  By applying DRE only for patients with a PSA higher than 2.0 ng/mL, the
biopsy rate would decrease by 36% while sensitivity would drop to only 92%.<Reference refidx="15"/> 
A previous report from this same institution found DRE to have poor performance
characteristics.  Among 10,523 men randomly assigned to screening, it was
reported that the overall prostate cancer detection rate using PSA, DRE, and
TRUS was 4.5% compared with only 2.5% if DRE alone had been used.  Among men
with a PSA lower than 3.0 ng/mL, the PPV of DRE was only
4% to 11%.<Reference refidx="16"/>  Despite the poor performance of DRE, a retrospective
case-control study of men in Olmsted County, Minnesota, who died of prostate
cancer found that case patients were less likely to have undergone DRE during
the 10 years before diagnosis of prostate cancer (OR,  0.51; 95%
 CI, 0.31–0.84).  These data suggested that screening DREs
may prevent 50% to 70% of deaths from prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="17"/>  Contrary to
these findings, results from a case-control study of 150 men who ultimately
died of prostate cancer were compared with 299 controls without disease.  In this
different population, a similar number of cases and controls had undergone DRE
during the 10-year interval before prostate cancer diagnosis.<Reference refidx="18"/>  One
case-control study reported no statistically significant association between
routine screening with DRE and occurrence of metastatic
prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="19"/>
The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) requested all men undergo prostate biopsy at study end to address ascertainment bias; the sensitivity of DRE for prostate cancer was 16.7%.  The sensitivity increased to 21.3% in men receiving finasteride.<Reference refidx="20"/></Para><Para id="_26">Rectal examination is inexpensive, relatively noninvasive, and nonmorbid and can be

prostate cancer.  Prostatic imaging is possible by ultrasound, computed
tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.  Each modality has relative merits
and disadvantages for distinguishing different features of prostate cancer. 
Ultrasound has received the most attention, having been examined by several
investigators in observational settings.<Reference refidx="21"/>  Sensitivity ranged from 71% to 92% for prostatic carcinoma and
60% to 85% for subclinical disease.  Specificity values ranged from 49% to 79%,
and PPV in the 30% range have been reported.  The
sensitivity and PPV for ultrasound as a single test may
be better than for rectal examination.  The rate of cancer is  extremely low among
ultrasound-positive patients in whom rectal and PSA examinations are normal.<Reference refidx="22"/>   TRUS is generally relegated to a role in the diagnostic work-up of an abnormal
screening test rather than in the screening algorithm.  The cost and poor performance of other imaging
modalities have led to their elimination from all early detection algorithms.</Para><Para id="_29">Contemporary prostate biopsy relies on spring-loaded biopsy devices that are
either digitally guided or guided via ultrasound.  TRUS
guidance is the most frequently used method of directing prostate needle biopsy because
there is some suggestion that the yield of biopsy is improved with such
guidance.<Reference refidx="23"/>  With the virtually simultaneous clinical acceptance of
TRUS, spring-loaded biopsy devices, and the proliferation of
PSA screening in the late 1980s, the number of prostate cores obtained from
patients with either an abnormal DRE or PSA was most commonly six, using a
sextant method of sampling the prostate.<Reference refidx="24"/>  There is evidence that the
predictable increase in cancer detection rates that would be expected by
increasing the number of biopsy cores beyond six does occur; e.g., biopsies with
12 or 15 cores would increase the proportion of biopsied men having cancer
detected by 30% to 35%.<Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/>  The extent to which such increased detection
will reduce morbidity and mortality from the disease or increase the fraction
of men treated unnecessarily is  unknown.

cancer is analogous to that for lung cancer screening in the 1950s and 1960s;
screening results in a shift to a higher proportion of cases with earlier-stage
cancers at diagnosis.  This shift  may result in mortality reduction.  For
lung cancer, no mortality benefit resulted.<Reference refidx="34"/>  However, the possibility of identifying
an excessive number of false-positives in the form of benign prostatic lesions
requires that the test be evaluated carefully.   
Furthermore, there is a  risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment (i.e.,    the detection of a histological malignancy that if left untreated would have had a benign or indolent natural history and would have been of no clinical significance).</Para><Para id="_114">A nested case-control
prospective study with 10 years of follow-up reported that a single elevated
PSA higher than 4.0 ng/mL predicted subsequent cancer with a sensitivity of

follow-up.  The cancers diagnosed were characterized by stage and grade to be
clinically  important.  Forty-two percent were extracapsular at diagnosis.<Reference refidx="35"/> 
Experience with repeat PSA screening suggests that tumors detected on follow-up
examinations are of lower clinical stage and grade.<Reference refidx="36"/>  Although a cutoff
value of 4.0 ng/mL is frequently used to prompt prostate biopsy, screening
studies have demonstrated that lowering the PSA cutoff will substantially
increase the number of cancers detected, particularly in African Americans.<Reference refidx="37"/> In one study of the impact of race on PSA and tumor volume,  these two variables were  higher among African American men after adjustment for age, stage, pathologic stage, Gleason score, and volume of benign disease.<Reference refidx="38"/> Furthermore, 
lower cutoff PSA values are associated with a high proportion of

Through registries in seven European countries, investigators identified 182,000 men between the ages of 50 and 74 years for inclusion in the study. The men were randomly assigned to a group that was offered PSA screening at an average of once every 4 years or to a control group that did not receive such screening. The predefined core age group for this study included 162,243 men between the ages of 55 and 69 years. The primary outcome was the rate of death from prostate cancer. Mortality follow-up was identical for the two study groups and ended on December 31, 2006. </Para><Para id="_226">Recruitment and randomization procedures differed among countries and were developed in accordance with national regulations. In Finland, Sweden, and Italy, the trial subjects were identified from population registries and were randomly assigned to the trials before written informed consent was provided.

With 14 years of data, and  a median follow-up of 9 years, there were 5,990 prostate cancers diagnosed in the screening group and 4,307 in the control group, corresponding to a cumulative incidence of 8.2% and 4.8%, respectively. There were 214 prostate-cancer deaths in the screening group and 326 prostate cancer deaths in the control group in the core age group. The unadjusted rate ratio for death from prostate cancer in the screening group was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.67–0.95); after adjustment for sequential testing with alpha spending due to two previous interim analyses (based on Poisson regression analysis), the rate ratio was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.65–0.98).

Microsimulation Screening Analysis (MISCAN) was used to estimate the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with annual PSA screening,<Reference refidx="51"/> based on results from the ERSPC trial.  Health states considered in the analysis of QALYs included biopsy, cancer diagnosis, radiation therapy, radical prostatectomy, active surveillance, postrecovery period, palliative therapy and terminal illness.  Adverse effects considered included overdiagnosis and various degrees of incontinence and erectile dysfunction. The model predicted that annual screening of 1,000 men aged 55 to 69 years would lead to nine fewer deaths from prostate cancer (98 men screened to prevent one prostate cancer death).    Overall,  73 life-years would be gained, but QALYs gained was only 56 life-years on average with a range of  -21  to 97 life-years.  Screening men aged 55 to 74 years increased life-years gained but resulted in the same number of QALYs on average (56 life-years).<Reference refidx="51"/></Para><Para id="_303">The Finnish Randomized Screening Trial is the largest component of the multicenter ERSPC consortium. Eighty thousand one hundred forty-four men born between 1929 and 1944 were identified from the Finnish Population Registry.  Men with a previous prostate cancer diagnosis were excluded. Thirty one thousand eight hundred sixty-six men were randomly assigned to the screening arm (SA) and the remaining 48,278 men were randomly assigned to the control arm (CA).  Randomization occurred annually from 1996 to 1999 (at ages 55, 59, 63, or 67 years at entry, which led to a similar age distribution in both arms).  Men randomly assigned to the CA were not contacted.  Men randomly assigned to the SA were invited to an initial screen, and if living in the study area and not already diagnosed with prostate cancer, were invited to second and third screenings at 4 and 8 years after randomization.

tumors are well-differentiated and microscopic in size.  Conversely, evidence
suggests that tumors of potential clinical  importance are larger and of higher

(1) a contemporaneous but unrelated decrease in detections of transition-zone
tumors caused by a fall in the number of transurethral resections of the
prostate due to the advent of effective treatment for benign prostatic
hyperplasia (including  alpha blockers and finasteride); and (2) an increase in
detection of peripheral-zone tumors due to the incorporation of TRUS-guided prostate biopsies.  Because transition-zone tumors are
predominantly low volume and low grade and because peripheral-zone tumors have a
preponderance of moderate-grade and high-grade disease, the proportion of higher grade tumors detected by current screening practices has increased
substantially.  A Detroit study found that between 1989 and 1996, 
poorly differentiated tumors remained stable and well-differentiated tumors
fell in frequency while moderately differentiated disease increased in
frequency.  The largest rise in incidence was in clinically localized
disease.<Reference refidx="83"/> It is now known that systematic changes to the histological interpretation of biopsy specimens by anatomical pathologists has occurred during the PSA screening era (i.e.,   since about 1985) in the United States.<Reference refidx="84"/> This phenomenon, sometimes called “grade inflation,” is the apparent increase in the distribution of high-grade tumors in the population over time        but in the absence of a true biological or clinical change.

further evaluation was warranted.  In this study (in which the patient numbers have been variously reported by the authors) of the 31,133 men who were

As such, the substantial increase in prostate cancer diagnoses in the late 1980s and early 1990s would then explain the increased rate of prostate cancer death during those years. As the rate of prostate cancer diagnosis fell in the early 1990s, this reduced rate of mislabeling death due to prostate cancer would fall, as would the overall rate of prostate cancer death.<Reference refidx="97"/> Since the evidence in this respect is inconsistent, it remains
unclear whether the causes of these mortality trends are chance, misclassification, early detection,
improved treatments, or a combination of effects.</Para><Para id="_88">The incidence of distant-stage prostate carcinoma was relatively flat until 1991 and then started declining rapidly. This decline probably was caused by the shift to  earlier stage disease associated with the rapid dissemination of  PSA screening. This stage shift can have a fairly sizable and rapid impact on population mortality, but it is   possible  that other factors such as hormonal therapy are   responsible for much of the decline in mortality.

The <ProtocolRef href="CDR0000078532" nct_id="NCT00002540">PLCO-1</ProtocolRef>, which is now closed to accrual, is following participants  to test the effect of early detection by DRE and PSA on reducing mortality.  A trial of screening is also being performed in Europe.<Reference refidx="89"/><Reference refidx="113"/> </Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="2479160" MedlineID="90050754">Scardino PT: Early detection of prostate cancer.

One study of these men at 12 months after their negative biopsy who reported worrying that they may develop cancer (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001), showed large increases in prostate-cancer worry compared with men with a normal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (26% vs. 6%).<Reference refidx="1"/> In the same study, biopsied men were more likely than those in the normal PSA group to have had at least one follow-up PSA test in the first year (73% vs. 42%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001), more likely to have had another biopsy (15% vs. 1%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt;  .001), and more likely to have visited a urologist (71% vs. 13%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001).</Para><Para id="_259">Three cohort studies in Sweden and in the United States linked databases to examine the association between new diagnosis of prostate cancer with cardiovascular events/death or with suicide.  One Swedish study found that in the first year after the diagnosis of prostate cancer, the risk of death from cardiovascular disease (CVD) was increased in men diagnosed with prostate cancer compared with men who were not diagnosed with prostate cancer (relative risk [RR] = 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9–2.0; adjusted for age, calendar time period, and time since diagnosis).  The risk of death from CVD was highest in the first week after diagnosis (RR = 11.2; 95% CI, 10.4–12.1) and was also higher in younger men (age &lt; 54 years).  These risks were less in men diagnosed in the most recent time periods.  Also in the first year after diagnosis, the risk of committing suicide was higher for men who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer (RR = 2.6; 95% CI, 2.1–3.0; adjusted for age, calendar time period, marital status, educational level, and history of psychiatric hospitalization).  Again, this was highest in the first week after diagnosis (RR = 8.4; 95% CI, 1.9–22.7).<Reference refidx="2"/> A second Swedish study largely confirmed these findings.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_260">The U.S. cohort study explored the association between prostate cancer diagnosis and CVD mortality or suicide in men diagnosed with prostate cancer compared with population-level expected rates during three different time periods (pre-PSA, peri-PSA, and post-PSA).  For CVD mortality, the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was elevated for men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the first month after diagnosis in all time periods (overall SMR = 2.05; 95% CI, 1.89–2.22), but decreased in later months during the first year (decreasing to &lt; 1.0 in the PSA time period).  This association was not changed to an important degree by age, race, or tumor grade. SMRs were higher for nonmarried men, for men who lived in lower educational status or higher poverty counties, and for men with metastatic disease at diagnosis.  Also, in the first 3 months after diagnosis, the SMR for suicide was higher in men with prostate cancer (SMR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4–2.6).  In months 4 to 12, the SMR was lower but still greater than 1.0.  The SMR for suicide, however, was only greater than 1.0 in the pre-PSA and peri-PSA time periods, but not in the post-PSA time period.  SMR was higher for nonmarried men but did not vary by education or poverty.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_261">These data lend credence to the concern that  overdiagnosis of  prostate cancer due to screening could lead to an increased risk of CVD mortality or suicide.</Para><Para id="_187">While there is no literature suggesting serious complications of digital rectal examination (DRE) or transrectal sonography, and the harms associated with venipuncture for PSA testing can be regarded as trivial, prostatic biopsies are associated with important complications. Transient fever, pain, hematospermia, and hematuria are all common, as are positive urine cultures.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/>    Sepsis occurs in approximately 0.4% of cases.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_188">Long-term complications of radical prostatectomy include urinary incontinence, urethral stricture, erectile dysfunction, and the morbidity associated with general anesthesia and a major surgical procedure. Fecal incontinence can also occur. The associated mortality rate is reported to be 0.1% to   1%, depending on age. In the population-based Prostate Cancer Outcomes Study,  8.4% of 1,291 men were incontinent and 59.9% were impotent at 18 or 24 months following radical prostatectomy. More than 40% of men reported that their sexual performance was a moderate-to-large problem. Both sexual and urinary function varied by age, with younger men relatively less affected.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_189"> Definitive external-beam radiation therapy can result in acute cystitis, proctitis, and sometimes enteritis. These are generally reversible but may be chronic. In the short-term, potency is preserved with irradiation in most cases but may diminish over time. A systematic review of evidence of complications of radiation therapy shows that 20% to 40% of men who had no erectile dysfunction before treatment developed dysfunction 12 to 24 months afterwards. Furthermore,     2% to 16% of men who had no urinary incontinence before treatment developed dysfunction 12 to 24 months afterward, and about 18% of men had some bowel dysfunction 1 year after treatment. The magnitude of effects of brachytherapy has not been determined, but the spectrum of complications are similar.<Reference refidx="10"/> Radiation to the prostate has been reported to  increase the risk of secondary malignancies, most notably of the rectum and bladder.  While the relative risk in a large Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-based study was 1.26 (95% CI, 1.21–1.30), the absolute increase in risk is low. The same review of evidence found hormone therapy with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists reduces sexual function by 40% to 70%, and is associated with breast swelling in 5% to 25% of men. Hot flashes occur in 50% to 60% of men taking LHRH agonists.<Reference refidx="8"/> (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062910" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-treatment-pdq">Prostate Cancer Treatment</SummaryRef> for more information.) </Para><Para id="_305">The question of whether prostate cancer treatment contributes to symptoms among screened prostate cancer survivors was addressed in an analysis from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. The 
randomized controlled PLCO analysis compared 529 prostate cancer survivors, 5 to 10 years postdiagnosis, with 514 noncancer controls, regarding prostate cancer-specific symptomatology. There was poorer sexual and urinary function among prostate cancer survivors compared with noncancer controls, suggesting that these symptoms are related to prostate cancer treatment and not aging or comorbidities.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_215">Screening has increased the incidence of prostate cancer.  In the current medical climate, most early-stage prostate cancers are treated by radical surgery or irradiation with intent to eradicate the pathology.  There is evidence that not all patients diagnosed with prostate cancer as a consequence of screening are in immediate need of curative treatment.  Death from other causes often occurs before screen detected, localized, and well-differentiated malignancies affect the survival of these patients.  To avoid overtreatment and consequent morbid events, active surveillance (AS) is an emerging strategy applicable in these kinds of cases wherein curative treatment is delayed pending objective medical evidence of disease progression.</Para><Para id="_236">The effectiveness of AS was retrospectively investigated in the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) trial.  Data from 577 men diagnosed with prostate cancer as a consequence of periodic screening between 1994 and 2007 at a mean age of 66.3 years in four participating clinical centers in the Netherlands, Sweden, and Finland were evaluated. Selection criteria for inclusion in the analysis were:</Para><ItemizedList id="_237" Style="bullet"><ListItem>   PSA less than or equal to 10 ng/mL.</ListItem><ListItem>PSA density less than 0.2 ng/mL.</ListItem><ListItem>  Stage T1C/T2.</ListItem><ListItem>Gleason score less than or equal to 3 + 3 = 6.</ListItem><ListItem>  No more than two positive biopsy cores.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_216">  Men with positive lymph nodes or distant metastases at the time of diagnosis were excluded from the analysis.  These are the same thresholds being applied in the (as yet unreported) prospective Prostate Cancer Research International: Active Surveillance   study on AS originating from ERSPC and in the (also unreported) protocol-based prospective study of AS in Canada.</Para><Para id="_217">The mean follow-up time for the 577 men in the retrospective assessment was 4.35 years (0–11.63 years).  The calculated 10-year prostate cancer-specific survival rate was 100%.  The overall 10-year survival rate was 77%.  The calculated 10-year deferred treatment-free survival rate was 43%.</Para><Para id="_218">After 7.75 years,   50% of men had received treatment.  The median treatment-free survival was 2.5 years.     Men treated during follow-up were slightly younger at diagnosis than men remaining untreated (64.7 years vs. 67.0 years; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt;           .001).  Of the 110 men shifting to active treatment despite favorable PSA levels and PSA doubling times,  DRE was known in 53 of the men and played a role in nine of them, whereas rebiopsies were known in 27 of the men and played a role in none of them.  On the basis of PSA characteristics, 1.9% of patients who remained untreated may have been better candidates for active treatment, while 55.8% of men who received active treatment were not obvious candidates for radical treatment and neither DRE nor rebiopsy explained the discrepancy.  Factors like anxiety and urologic complaints may have been more explanatory, but the data were not available.</Para><Para id="_219">The authors conclude that their data confirm prior studies'                          findings, that  many screen-detected prostate cancers may be actively followed (e.g., AS), and curative treatment delayed, thereby delaying or avoiding the morbid consequences of radical therapy without diminishing survival.  The authors also note that a considerable fraction of men do not comply with the AS regimen apparently for psychological reasons, and  AS often results in delay, not avoidance, of radical therapy.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="16808772">Fowler FJ Jr, Barry MJ, Walker-Corkery B, et al.: The impact of a suspicious prostate biopsy on patients' psychological, socio-behavioral, and medical care outcomes.
