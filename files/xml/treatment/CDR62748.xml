scratch.  It is a distressing symptom that can cause discomfort and threaten
the effectiveness of the skin as a major protective barrier.  Because of the
subjective nature of pruritus, the lack of a precise definition, and the lack
of suitable animal models, pruritus is a disorder that has not been researched
adequately.
</Para><Para id="_3">The skin accounts for 15% of the body's total weight and is the largest organ of
the body.  The skin has significant psychosocial and physical functions.  Its
function as a protective mechanism is the skin's most important role.  But skin
is also essential to self image and one's ability to touch and be touched,
thereby providing an important component of communication.
</Para><Para id="_4">Symptoms of generalized itching, without rash or skin lesions, may be related
to anything from dry skin to an occult carcinoma, and the etiology of the
symptoms should be explored.  Common nonmalignant etiologic factors include
drug reactions, xerosis, scabies, and primary skin diseases.  Pruritus is one of
the most common complaints of the elderly patient, but estimates of the
significance of pruritic symptoms in the elderly population vary from 10% to
50%.  The most common diagnosis related to pruritus in this population is
simply dry skin.<Reference refidx="1"/>
</Para><Para id="_5">Generalized pruritus is found in about 13% of all individuals with chronic
renal disease and about 70% to 90% of those undergoing hemodialysis for its
treatment.<Reference refidx="2"/>  Cholestatic liver disease with intrahepatic or posthepatic
obstruction, with or without increased serum levels of bile acids, is often
associated with pruritus.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Other etiologic factors include (but are not
limited to) primary biliary cirrhosis, cholestasis related to phenothiazines or
oral contraceptives, intrahepatic cholestasis in pregnancy, and posthepatic
obstruction.<Reference refidx="3"/>
</Para><Para id="_1_4">In this summary, unless otherwise stated, evidence and practice issues as they relate to adults are discussed.

Some
conditions that cause iron deficiency, including exfoliative skin disorder,
also cause pruritus.  Diabetes and thyrotoxicosis are endocrine causes of
pruritus.<Reference refidx="1"/>
</Para><Para id="_8">Pruritus is a frequent clinical manifestation of people with AIDS, AIDS-related
Kaposi sarcoma, and AIDS-related opportunistic infections.  Pruritus with or
without rash has been reported in approximately 84% of people with AIDS and
35.5% of those with AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma.  The incidence of pruritus
associated with AIDS-related opportunistic infections approaches 100%.<Reference refidx="2"/>
</Para><Para id="_9">Various malignant diseases are known to produce pruritus.  Hodgkin lymphoma
causes pruritus in 10% to 25% of patients.  In some instances, pruritus
precedes diagnosis of the lymphoma <Reference refidx="1"/> and may be an indicator of a less
favorable prognosis when associated with significant fever or weight loss (“B”
symptoms).<Reference refidx="3"/>  Pruritus associated with Hodgkin lymphoma is characterized by
symptoms of burning and intense itching occurring on a localized skin area,
frequently on the lower legs.  Other lymphomas and leukemias have been
associated with a less intense but more generalized pruritus.  Adenocarcinomas
and squamous cell carcinomas of various organs (i.e., stomach, pancreas, lung,
colon, brain, breast, and prostate) sometimes produce generalized pruritus that
is more pronounced on the legs, upper trunk, and extensor surfaces of the upper
extremities.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="3"/>  Pruritus associated with malignant diseases has been
observed to diminish or disappear with eradication of the tumor and reappear
with recurrence of disease.<Reference refidx="3"/>
</Para><Para id="_10">Drugs associated with secondary pruritus include opium derivatives (cocaine,
morphine, butorphanol), phenothiazines, tolbutamide, erythromycin estolate,
anabolic hormones, estrogens, progestins, testosterone and subsequent
cholestasis, aspirin, quinidine and other antimalarials, biologics such as
monoclonal antibodies, and vitamin B complex.  Subclinical sensitivity to any
drug may be related to pruritus.<Reference refidx="3"/>
</Para><Para id="_11">Hypothesized mechanisms of pruritus have been inferred from studies of pain,
since pain and itching share common molecular and neurophysiological
mechanisms.<Reference refidx="4"/>  Both itch and pain sensations result from the activation of a
network of free nerve endings at the dermal-epidermal junction.  Activation may
be the result of internal or external thermal, mechanical, chemical, or
electrical stimulation.  The cutaneous nerve stimulation is activated or
mediated by several substances including histamine, vasoactive peptides,
enkephalins, substance P (a tachykinin that affects smooth muscle), and
prostaglandins.  It is believed that nonanatomic factors (such as psychological
stress, tolerance, presence and intensity of other sensations and/or
distractions) determine itch sensitivity in different regions of the body.
</Para><Para id="_12">The itch impulse is transmitted along the same neural pathway as pain impulses,
i.e., traveling from peripheral nerves to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord,
across the cord via the anterior commissure, and ascending along the
spinothalamic tract to the laminar nuclei of the contralateral thalamus. 
Thalamocortical tracts of tertiary neurons are believed to relay the impulse
through the integrating reticular activating system of the thalamus to several
areas of the cerebral cortex.  Factors that are believed to enhance the
sensation of itch include dryness of the epidermis and dermis, anoxia of
tissues, dilation of the capillaries, irritating stimuli, and psychological
responses.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>
</Para><Para id="_13">The motor response of scratching follows the perception of itch.  Scratching is
modulated at the corticothalamic center and is a spinal reflex.  After
scratching, itching may be relieved for 15 to 25 minutes.  The mechanism
through which the itch is relieved by scratching is unknown.  It is
hypothesized that scratching generates sensory impulses that break circuits
in the relay areas of the spinal cord.  Scratching may actually enhance the
sensation of itching, creating a characteristic itch-scratch-itch cycle.  Other
physical stimuli such as vibration, heat, cold, and ultraviolet radiation
diminish itching and increase the release of proteolytic enzymes, potentially
eliciting the itch-scratch-itch cycle.
</Para><Para id="_14">A pinprick near or in the same dermatome as an itchy point will abolish the
itch sensation.<Reference refidx="3"/>  It is known that hard scratching may substitute pain for
the itch, and in some instances, the patient might find pain the more tolerable
sensation.  It is thought that spinal modulation of afferent stimuli (Gate
theory) and central mechanisms may play a role in the relief of itch.<Reference refidx="3"/>
</Para><Para id="_15">Hypothesized pathogenesis of pruritus associated with underlying disease states
are varied.  Biliary, hepatic, renal, and malignant diseases are thought to
produce pruritus through circulating toxic substances.  Histamine released from
circulating basophils and the release of leukopeptidase from white blood cells
may trigger pruritus associated with lymphomas and leukemias.  Elevated blood
levels of kininogen in Hodgkin lymphoma, release of histamine or bradykinin
precursors from solid tumors, and release of serotonin in carcinoid may all be
related to pruritus.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="6"/>
</Para><Para id="_16">People receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, irradiation, and/or biologic response
modifiers for treatment of malignancy are likely to experience pruritus.  This
same population is quite likely to be exposed to many of the other etiologic
factors relating to pruritus ranging from nutritionally related xerosis (dry
skin) to radiation desquamation, chemotherapy and biologic agent–induced side
effects, antibiotic reactions, and other drug sensitivities.
</Para><SummarySection id="_97"><Title>Cytotoxic Chemotherapy
</Title><Para id="_18">Each of the major classes of antineoplastic agents (alkylating agents,
antimetabolites, antibiotics, plant alkaloids, nitrosoureas, and enzymes)
include drugs capable of producing cutaneous reactions including pruritus. 
Patients receiving antineoplastic drugs frequently report dry skin and scaling,
thought to be related to effects on sebaceous and sweat glands.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/>  Many
problems are self-limiting and require no active intervention.  Other problems
warrant anticipation and implementation of preventive measures.
</Para><Para id="_19">Hypersensitivity to cytotoxic agents can be manifested by pruritus, edema,
urticaria, and erythema.  Hypersensitivity reactions vary in symptomatology and
depend on the drug, the dosage, and the allergy history of the patient.  The
agents most associated with hypersensitivities include doxorubicin,
daunorubicin, cytarabine, L-asparaginase, paclitaxel, and cisplatin.  In most
reports, these reactions have been localized to the area of the vascular access
and dissipate within 30 to 90 minutes.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/>  More dramatic and even
life-threatening reactions can occur, and the development of pruritus may
represent an early stage of serious hypersensitivity reactions.<Reference refidx="11"/>
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_98"><Title>Radiation Therapy</Title><Para id="_21">Radiation therapy–related pruritus is usually associated with dry desquamation
of skin within the treatment field.  Dryness and pruritus may occur at an
accumulated dose of 20 Gy to 28 Gy,<Reference refidx="12"/> and is caused by obliteration of
sebaceous glands within the field.  This is an acute phenomenon that correlates
with the depletion of actively proliferating basal cells in the epidermal layer
of the skin, a fixed percentage of which die with each dose fraction of
irradiation.  Remaining basal cells undergo cornification and shed at an
increased rate, while nonproliferating basal cells are stimulated and their
cell cycle shortened.  Subsequent peeling of the skin is defined as dry
desquamation.  The skin becomes dry, and the patient may notice itching and
burning sensations.<Reference refidx="12"/>  Dry skin is susceptible to further injury through
scratching and/or formation of fissures, augmenting the risk of infection and
tissue necrosis.
</Para><Para id="_22">If the desquamation process continues, the dermis will eventually be exposed, resulting in moist desquamation.  This side effect increases the risk of
infection, discomfort, and pain, possibly necessitating interruption of a
treatment plan to allow for healing.  This interruption can compromise the final outcome of
cancer therapy.  For this reason, it is desirable to anticipate and prevent the
progression of skin reactions to this stage.<Reference refidx="13"/>
</Para><Para id="_23">External beam therapy with electrons may elicit more skin reactions than photon
therapy since the depth of penetration and linear energy transfer is closer to
the skin surface with electrons.  Radiation delivery techniques (bolus doses
and tangential fields) also influence the degree of reaction.  Fields that
include skin folds (i.e., the axilla, breast, perineum, and gluteus) are
anticipated to have increased reactions because of friction, higher moisture
content, and low aeration.<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/>
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_99"><Title>Combination Therapy</Title><Para id="_25">Therapy combining radiation and chemotherapy plays a significant role in
state-of-the-art cancer therapy.  The synergism of these cytotoxic modalities
enhances normal tissue reaction and can be expected to precipitate higher
complication rates.<Reference refidx="7"/>  The total combined effects of the drugs and irradiation
exceed the individual effects of either modality.  Significant cutaneous
reactions are thought to occur more frequently when chemotherapy and
irradiation are administered concurrently.<Reference refidx="16"/>
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_100"><Title>Biologic Response Modifiers</Title><Para id="_27">Biologic response modifiers used in the treatment of malignant disease are
associated with a wide variety of side effects and toxic effects.  Pruritus has
been a side effect associated with several biologics but has been most
reported in patients receiving interferons.<Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/>  Reports of
pruritus as a side effect of biologics are primarily anecdotal and have not
been a focus of attention.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_101"><Title>Bone Marrow Transplantation</Title><Para id="_29">Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affects 25% to 50% of patients who live longer
than 100 days after bone marrow transplantation.  The incidence of skin GVHD is
reported to be 80% to 90%, and symptoms vary in severity and type.<Reference refidx="21"/>  Reported
skin changes include dryness and pruritic, erythematous, maculopapular rashes. 
Onset can be subtle or sudden; skin GVHD can progress to scleroderma and
contracture.<Reference refidx="22"/>
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_102"><Title>Other Pharmacologic Support During Cancer Treatment
</Title><Para id="_31">Many pharmacologic agents employed at any point during the cancer course,
whether in a primary treatment plan or incorporated into a symptom control or
supportive care program, are capable of eliciting a pruritic reaction.  These
drugs include morphine, other opium derivatives, and aspirin used in pain
management; corticosteroids; antibiotics; phenothiazines; and, to a lesser
degree, hormonal agents (estrogen, progestins, and testosterone).<Reference refidx="3"/> 
Mechanisms of these reactions range from hypersensitivity to chemical
interference with neural pathways.<Reference refidx="4"/>
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_103"><Title>Infection</Title><Para id="_33">Pruritus can be a symptom of infection.  Pruritus involving anal or vulvar
areas might be caused by infections with Trichomonas or fungi, local tumors,
hemorrhoids, anal fissures, fistula discharge, wound effluent, or surgical
wound drainage.

improve skin hydration can be employed.  The main source of hydration for skin
is moisture from the vasculature of underlying tissues.  Water, not lipid,
regulates the pliability of the epidermis, providing the rationale for use of
emollients.<Reference refidx="6"/>  Emollients reduce evaporation by forming occlusive and
semiocclusive films over the skin surface, encouraging the production of
moisture in the layer of epidermis beneath the film (hence, the term
moisturizer).<Reference refidx="3"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663089">Level of evidence: IV</LOERef>]

preparation, its cost, and acceptability to the patient.<Reference refidx="3"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663089">Level of evidence: IV</LOERef>]  Emollient creams
or lotions should be applied at least two or three times daily and after
bathing.  Recommended emollient creams include Eucerin or Nivea or lotions such
as Lubriderm, Alpha Keri, or Nivea.<Reference refidx="4"/>  Gels with a local anesthetic (0.5%–2%
lidocaine) can be used on some areas, as often as every 2 hours if
necessary.<Reference refidx="8"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663089">Level of evidence: IV</LOERef>]
</Para><Para id="_80">Some topical agents including talcum powders, perfumed powders, bubble baths,
and cornstarch can irritate the skin and cause pruritus.  Cornstarch has been
an acceptable intervention for pruritus associated with dry desquamation
related to radiation therapy, but it should not be applied to moist skin surfaces,
areas with hair, sebaceous glands, skin folds or areas close to mucosal
surfaces, such as the vagina and rectum.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/>  Glucose is formed when
cornstarch is moistened, providing an excellent medium for fungal growth.<Reference refidx="10"/> 
Agents with metal ions (i.e., talcum and aluminum used in antiperspirants)
enhance skin reactions during external beam radiation therapy and should be
avoided throughout the course of radiation therapy.  Other common ingredients
in over-the-counter lotions and creams that may enhance skin reactions include
alcohol and menthol.  Topical steroids can reduce itching, but they reduce blood flow
to the skin, resulting in thinning of the skin and increased susceptibility to
injury.<Reference refidx="11"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663089">Level of evidence: IV</LOERef>]
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_110"><Title>Skin Cleansing</Title><Para id="_82">The goal of skin cleansing is to remove dirt and prevent odor, but actual
hygienic practices are influenced by skin type, lifestyle, and culture. 
Extensive bathing aggravates dry skin, and hot baths cause vasodilation, which
further promotes itching.  Many soaps are salts of fatty acids with an alkali
base.  Soap is a degreaser and can also irritate skin.  Older adults or
individuals with dry skin should limit use of soaps to those areas with
apocrine glands.  Plain water should suffice for other skin surfaces.  Mild
soaps have less soap or detergent content.  Superfatted soaps deposit a film of
oil on the skin surface, but there is no proof that they are less drying than
other soaps and they may be more expensive.
</Para><Para id="_83">Tepid baths have an antipruritic effect, possibly resulting from capillary
vasoconstriction.  The bath should be limited to a half hour every day or every
two days.  Examples of mild soaps that can be recommended include Dove,
Neutrogena, and Basis.  Oil can be added to the water at the end of the bath or
applied to the skin before towel drying.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_111"><Title>Environment</Title><Para id="_85">Heat increases cutaneous blood flow and may enhance itching.  Heat also lowers
humidity, and skin loses moisture when the relative humidity is less than 40%.
A cool, humid environment may reverse these processes.
</Para><Para id="_86">Residue left by detergents used in laundering clothes and linens, as well as
fabric softeners and antistatic products, may aggravate pruritus.  Detergent
residue can be neutralized by the addition of vinegar (1 teaspoon per quart
of water) to rinse water.  Mild laundry soaps marketed for infant items may
offer a solution as well.
</Para><Para id="_87">Loose-fitting, lightweight cotton clothes and cotton bed sheets are suggested.
The elimination of heavy bedcovers may alleviate itching by decreasing body
heat.  Wool and some synthetic fabrics may be irritating.  Distraction, music
therapy, relaxation, and imagery may be useful to relieve symptoms.<Reference refidx="12"/>
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_112"><Title>Pharmacologic Therapy</Title><Para id="_89">If treatment of the underlying disease and/or control of other aggravating
factors provides inadequate relief of pruritus, topical and oral medications
may be useful.  Topical steroids may provide relief when symptoms are related
to a steroid-responsive dermatosis, but anticipated benefits must be weighed
against the vasoconstrictive side effects.  Topical steroids have no role in
the management of pruritus of unknown origin.  Topical steroids should not be
applied to skin surfaces inside a radiation treatment field.
</Para><Para id="_90">Systemic medications useful in the management of pruritus include those
directed toward the underlying disease or control of symptoms.  Antibiotics can
reduce symptoms associated with infection.  Oral antihistamines may provide
symptomatic relief in histamine-related itching.  A higher dose of
antihistamines at bedtime may produce antipruritic and sedative effects. 
Diphenhydramine hydrochloride, 25 mg to 50 mg every 6 hours, has demonstrated
effectiveness.<Reference refidx="13"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663089">Level of evidence: IV</LOERef>] Hydroxyzine hydrochloride, 25 mg to 50 mg every 6 to 8
hours, or cyproheptadine hydrochloride, 4 mg every 6 to 8 hours, may provide
symptomatic relief.<Reference refidx="14"/>  Oral chlorpheniramine (4 mg) or hydroxyzine (10 mg or
25 mg) orally every 4 to 6 hours has been used with good results.<Reference refidx="15"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663089">Level of evidence: IV</LOERef>]  If one
antihistamine is ineffective, one of another class may provide relief.
</Para><Para id="_91">Sedative or tranquilizing agents may be indicated, especially if relief is not
provided by other agents.  Antidepressants can have strong antihistamine and
antipruritic effects.<Reference refidx="15"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663089">Level of evidence: IV</LOERef>]  Diazepam may be useful in some situations to
alleviate anxiety and promote rest.<Reference refidx="16"/>
</Para><Para id="_92">Sequestrant agents may be effective in relieving pruritus associated with renal
or hepatic disease through binding and removing pruritogenic substances in the
gut and reducing bile salt concentration.  Cholestyramine is not always
effective and produces gastric side effects.<Reference refidx="17"/>
</Para><Para id="_93">Aspirin seems to have reduced pruritus in some individuals while increasing
pruritus in others.  Thrombocytopenic cancer patients should be cautioned
against using aspirin.  Cimetidine alone or in combination with aspirin has
been used with some effectiveness for pruritus associated with Hodgkin lymphoma and polycythemia vera.<Reference refidx="18"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663087">Level of evidence: III</LOERef>]</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_113"><Title>Physical Modalities</Title><Para id="_95">Alternatives to scratching for the relief of pruritus can help the patient
interrupt the itch-scratch-itch cycle.  Application of a cool washcloth or ice
over the site may be useful.  Firm pressure at the site of itching, at a site
contralateral to the site of itching, and at acupressure points may break the
neural pathway.  Rubbing, pressure, and vibration can be used to relieve
itching.<Reference refidx="2"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663089">Level of evidence: IV</LOERef>]<Reference refidx="12"/>
</Para><Para id="_96">There are anecdotal reports of the use of transcutaneous electronic nerve
stimulators (TENS) and acupuncture in the management of pruritus.<Reference refidx="1"/> 
Ultraviolet phototherapy has been used with limited success for pruritus
related to uremia.<Reference refidx="1"/>
