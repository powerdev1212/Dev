One meta-analysis indicated a 30-fold increase in anal cancer in HIV-infected people, compared with the general population (SIR, 28.8; 95% CI, 21.6–38.3).<Reference refidx="19"/> A nationwide Danish  cohort  study with data from 1995 to 2009 observed an even stronger association (incidence rate ratio, 77.9; 95% CI, 36.2–167.7).<Reference refidx="20"/> This association between HIV infection and anal cancer  is confounded or modified by other factors associated with anal cancer, such as HPV status, high-risk behaviors, and level of immunocompromise. For example, the magnitude of the association between HIV infection and anal cancer risk varies by sexual preference. In one study,<Reference refidx="21"/> the highest SIR and the highest incidence rate were observed for HIV-positive MSM, compared with HIV-negative men  (SIR, 80.3; 95% CI, 42.7–151.1); the incidence rate  for HIV-positive MSM is 131 per 100,000 person-years. The SIR for HIV-positive men who did not have sex with men was lower but nonnegligible (SIR, 26.7; 95% CI, 11.5–61.7; incidence rate, 46 per 100,000 person-years). In the same study, 30 of 8,842 HIV-positive women  had anal cancer diagnoses (incidence rate, 2 per 100,000 person-years) but none of the 11,653 HIV-negative women were diagnosed with anal cancer; thus, no SIR could be calculated, and the incidence rate was zero. Among men with anal cancer, the Danish study observed a mortality rate ratio of 3.2 (95% CI, 1.1–9.2) for HIV-positive men compared with men in the general population.<Reference refidx="20"/></Para><Para id="_59">Anal HPV infection is common in HIV-positive individuals.

While decreases have been observed for other HIV-associated cancers, such trends have not been observed for anal cancer. It has been proposed that timing of cART treatment influences the risk of anal cancer, and that to be effective against anal cancer, cART must be administered to those with HPV infection earlier in the course of infection than has been clinically practiced.<Reference refidx="25"/>  One study suggests that immunosuppression levels 6 to 7 years before anal cancer diagnosis may be more strongly associated with odds of developing the disease than immunosuppression levels in the 12 months before anal cancer diagnosis. </Para><Para id="_80">Investigators reported ORs for CD4+ counts 6 to 7 years before anal cancer diagnosis as follows:<Reference refidx="24"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_83" Style="bullet">

Because HPV and HIV infection are highly correlated with high-risk sexual practices, few data exist that assess the independent effects of sexual behaviors.

As previously mentioned, HIV-positive MSM have the highest anal cancer rates (about 50 per 100,000 person-years),<Reference refidx="10"/>  but HIV-negative MSM have significantly higher rates than do men in the general population; their incidence is estimated to be 5 per 100,000 person-years.<Reference refidx="10"/>  Case-control studies have observed a modest (about twofold) increase in risk for women who practice receptive anal intercourse;<Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/> however, one study found the association to exist only among women who first had anal intercourse before age of 30 years (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.7–6.6).<Reference refidx="27"/> In the same study, adjusted ORs for both men and women increased with increasing lifetime number of sexual partners.

A cohort study of the Denmark National Patient Registry that included nearly 30 years’ experience observed statistically significant 3-fold increases in risk for Crohn disease (SIR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.2–6.4) and psoriasis (SIR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.8–5.1), as well as a 9-fold increase for polyarteritis nodosa (SIR, 8.8; 95% CI, 1.5–29.0) and a 12-fold increase in Wegener granulomatosis (SIR, 12.4; 95% CI, 2.1–40.8).<Reference refidx="30"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_67"><Title>Cigarette smoking</Title><Para id="_68">Cigarette smoking was among the first risk factors for anal cancer to be identified.

Another case-control study of 306 patients suggested that current cigarette smoking may be an independent risk factor for anal cancer because adjustment for HPV status and number of sexual partners dampened but did not eliminate the significant associations observed in the 1987 study; the OR for men was 3.9 (95% CI, 1.9–8.0) and for women was 3.8 (95% CI, 2.3–6.2).<Reference refidx="28"/> Given the rarity of anal cancer, studies have not been able to rigorously explore whether risk of anal cancer varies by other aspects of smoking history, such as pack-years smoked and time since cessation.

Conducted from 2004 to 2008, a multicountry trial randomly assigned 4,065 boys and men to receive either the three-shot quadrivalent HPV vaccine regimen (for HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18) or a three-shot placebo injection regimen. Of the 4,065 patients, 602 reported having sex with male partners in the year before enrollment. Heterosexual participants were between the ages of 16 years and 23 years and had no more than five lifetime female partners; those reporting sex with male partners were between the ages of 16 years and 26 years and had no more than five lifetime male or female partners. Persistent infection was defined as detection of the same HPV type in anogenital swabs or biopsy specimens collected on two or more consecutive visits, with an interval of 6 months between visits. In the intent-to-treat analysis, which included participants regardless of their baseline HPV status, the efficacy against persistent HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18 infection was 48% (95% CI, 36.0%–57.6%). Among those who were negative for the four HPV strains of interest at baseline (per the  protocol analysis, which included1,397 intervention and 1,408 control-arm participants), vaccine efficacy against  persistent HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18 infection was 90% (95% CI, 69.2%–98.1%).<Reference refidx="32"/></Para><Para id="_72">Among the 602 subjects who had sex with men, the vaccine efficacy against persistent HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18 infection was 59% (95% CI, 43.0%–71.4%) in the intent-to-treat analysis and  95% (95% CI, 80.4%–99.4%) in the per-protocol analysis. Efficacy against HPV-6, -11, -16 or -18–associated AIN was 50% (95% CI, 25.7%–67.2%) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 77.5% (95% CI, 39.6%–93.9%) in the per-protocol analysis (275 intervention and 276 control-arm participants). Efficacy against HPV-6, -11, -16, or -18–associated high-grade AIN was 54.2% (95% CI, 18.0%–75.3%) in the intent-to-treat analysis and 74.9% (95% CI, 8.8%–95.4%) in the per-protocol analysis (194 intervention and 208 control-arm participants).<Reference refidx="33"/></Para><Para id="_73">Efficacy of the bivalent (HPV-16 and -18) vaccine against anal infection was evaluated in the context of a randomized controlled trial of cervical cancer prevention. Conducted in 6,300 Costa Rican women aged 18 to 25 years at enrollment, the trial compared the efficacy of the three-dose bivalent vaccine with that of a control vaccine. Four years after vaccination, most women were offered the option of providing an anal specimen. Among the 2,103 intervention and 2,107 control-arm participants who provided specimens, vaccine efficacy (that is, absence of HPV-16 or -18 in the specimen) was 62% (95% CI, 47.1%–73.1%). Among the 1,003 intervention and 986 control-arm participants who provided anal specimens, received the three doses, had no evidence of cervical HPV-16 or -18 infection, and were seronegative before vaccination, vaccine efficacy was 84% (66.7%–92.8%).<Reference refidx="34"/></Para><Para id="_74">These data strongly suggest that vaccination against oncogenic strains will lead to reductions in anal cancer. They also suggest that vaccination before exposure will provide the most benefit.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_75"><Title>Interventions With Inadequate Evidence as to Whether They Reduce the 
Risk of Anal Cancer
</Title><SummarySection id="_76"><Title>Condom use</Title><Para id="_77">Because HPV can be transmitted through microabrasions, as well as through more pronounced exposures such as exchange of certain bodily fluids,<Reference refidx="12"/> restriction of condom use to penetrative activity will not protect against transmission that occurs as part of other sexual contact.  Nevertheless, condom use would be expected to provide some reduction in risk of transmission, and thus anal cancer risk. Few data that explore these hypotheses exist, and those that do suggest a very modest effect, if any. Of note, the ability of condom use to reduce cervical cancer risk is still uncertain and the subject of debate.<Reference refidx="35"/></Para><Para id="_78">In an Italian cohort of 258 HIV-negative MSM, the OR for inconsistent or no use of condoms in receptive anal sex, relative to consistent use, was 1.7 (95% CI, 0.52–6.3) for infection with high-risk HPV strains.<Reference refidx="36"/> In a Brazilian cohort that included 176 MSM, the OR for oncogenic HPV infection was 1.8 (95% CI, 0.77–4.35) for men who sometimes used condoms for anal sex and 1.8 (95% CI, 0.58–5.68) for men who never used condoms, compared with men who always used condoms.<Reference refidx="37"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">American Cancer Society: Cancer Facts and Figures 2015.
