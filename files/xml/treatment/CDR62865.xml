as “a communication process that deals with the human problems associated
with the occurrence, or risk of occurrence, of a genetic disorder in a family."
The process involves an attempt by one or more appropriately trained persons to
help the individual or family do the following:</Para><OrderedList id="_150" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>Comprehend the medical facts, including the
diagnosis, probable course of the disorder, and the available management.</ListItem><ListItem>Appreciate the way that heredity contributes to the disorder, and to the risk
of recurrence (occurrence), in specific relatives.</ListItem><ListItem>Understand the
alternatives for dealing with the risk of recurrence (occurrence).</ListItem><ListItem>Choose a
course of action that seems to them appropriate in view of their risk, their
family goals, and their ethical and religious standards and act in accordance
with that decision.</ListItem><ListItem>Make the best possible adjustment to the disorder
in an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460124">affected</GlossaryTermRef> family member and/or to the risk of recurrence (occurrence) of
that disorder.<Reference refidx="12"/></ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_1063">In 2006, the National Society of Genetic Counselors further refined the definition of genetic counseling to include the process of helping people understand and adapt to the medical, psychological, and familial implications of genetic contributions to disease, including integration of the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_1064" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Interpretation of family and medical histories to assess the chance of disease occurrence or recurrence.</ListItem><ListItem>Education about inheritance, testing, management, prevention, resources, and research.</ListItem><ListItem>Counseling to promote informed choices and adaptation to the risk or condition.<Reference refidx="4"/></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_152">Central to the philosophy and practice of genetic counseling are the principles of
voluntary utilization of services, informed decision making, attention to
psychosocial and affective dimensions of coping with genetic risk, and
protection of patient confidentiality and privacy.  This is facilitated through a combination of 
rapport building and information gathering; establishing or verifying
diagnoses; risk assessment and calculation of quantitative
occurrence/recurrence risks; education and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044677">informed consent</GlossaryTermRef> processes;
psychosocial assessment, support, and counseling appropriate to a family’s
culture and ethnicity; and other relevant background characteristics.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/> The psychosocial assessment is especially important in the genetic counseling process because individuals most vulnerable to adverse effects of genetic information may include those who have had difficulty dealing with stressful life events in the past.<Reference refidx="15"/>  Variables that may influence psychosocial adjustment to genetic information include individual and familial factors; cultural factors; and health system factors such as the type of test, disease status, and risk information.<Reference refidx="15"/>  Findings from a psychosocial assessment can be used to help guide the direction of the counseling session.<Reference refidx="5"/> An important objective of genetic counseling is to provide an opportunity for shared decision making when the medical benefits of one course of action are not demonstrated to be superior to another.  The relationship between the availability of effective medical treatment for <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046063">mutation</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460132">carriers</GlossaryTermRef> and the clinical validity of a given test affects the degree to which personal choice or physician recommendation is supported in counseling at-risk individuals.<Reference refidx="16"/>  Uptake of genetic counseling services among those referred varies based on the cancer syndrome. For example, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer genetic referral uptake is moderate (about 30%).<Reference refidx="17"/> Efforts to decrease barriers to service utilization are ongoing (e.g., a patient navigator telephone call may increase utilization of these services by at-risk women).<Reference refidx="18"/> Readers

In a telephone survey of 1,019 individuals, only 6% did not know whether a first-degree relative had cancer; this increased to 8.5% for second-degree relatives.<Reference refidx="37"/> However, people often have incomplete or inaccurate information about the cancer history in their family.<Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="36"/><Reference refidx="38"/><Reference refidx="39"/><Reference refidx="40"/><Reference refidx="41"/><Reference refidx="42"/><Reference refidx="43"/><Reference refidx="44"/> A population-based survey of 2,605 first- and second-degree relatives and confirmed proband reports of cancer diagnoses found that the accuracy of reported cancer diagnoses in relatives was low to moderate, while reports of no history of cancer were accurate.<Reference refidx="42"/> Accuracy varies by cancer site and degree of relatedness.<Reference refidx="42"/><Reference refidx="45"/><Reference refidx="46"/> Reporting of cancer family histories may be most accurate for breast cancer <Reference refidx="42"/><Reference refidx="46"/> and less accurate for gynecologic malignancies <Reference refidx="42"/><Reference refidx="46"/> and colon cancer.<Reference refidx="42"/> Self-reported family histories may contain errors and, in rare instances, could be fictitious.<Reference refidx="40"/><Reference refidx="46"/><Reference refidx="47"/> It is important to confirm the primary site of cancers in the family that will affect the calculation of hereditary predisposition probabilities and/or estimation of empiric cancer risks, especially if decisions such as risk-reducing surgery will be based on this family history.<Reference refidx="40"/><Reference refidx="47"/> The most reliable documentation of cancer histology is the pathology report. Verification of cancers can also be made through other medical records, tumor registries, or death certificates. A U.K. study illustrates the importance of verification of the cancer family history in individuals with a family history of breast cancer (n = 2,278) and colon cancer (n = 1,184).<Reference refidx="44"/> Changes in genetic risk assignment (reassignment) from baseline to final time points (e.g., low risk to high risk) warranting management changes were reported in nearly 30% of families with colorectal cancer and 20% of families with breast cancer. Verification of reported cancer diagnoses in this cohort revealed a lower overall degree of consistency between reported and confirmed diagnoses than in other studies.<Reference refidx="40"/><Reference refidx="48"/></Para><Para id="_342">It is also important to consider limited, missing, or questionable information when reviewing a pedigree for cancer risk assessment. It is more difficult to identify features of hereditary disease in families with a  truncated family structure due to loss of contact with relatives, small family size, or deaths at an early age from unrelated conditions. When there are few family members of the at-risk gender when considering a particular syndrome with primarily male or female specific disease manifestations, the family history may be difficult to assess (e.g., few female members in a family at risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome).  In addition, information collected on risk-reducing surgical procedures, such as oophorectomy, could significantly change prior probability estimation and the constellation of cancers observed in a family.<Reference refidx="49"/> Other factors to clarify and document whenever possible are adoptions, use of donor egg or sperm, consanguinity, and uncertain paternity.</Para><Para id="_343">Additionally, family histories are dynamic. The occurrence of additional cancers may alter the likelihood of a hereditary predisposition to cancer, and consideration of differential diagnoses or empiric cancer risk estimates may change if additional cancers arise in the family. Furthermore, changes in the cancer family history over time may alter recommendations for earlier or more intense cancer screening. A descriptive study that examined baseline and follow-up family history data from a U.S. population-based cancer registry reported that family history of breast cancer or colorectal cancer becomes increasingly relevant in early adulthood and  changes significantly from age 30 years to age 50 years.<Reference refidx="50"/> Therefore, it is important to advise the consultand to take note of, confirm, and report cancer diagnoses or other pertinent family health history that occurs after completion of the initial risk assessment process. This is especially important if genetic testing was not performed or was <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000556485">uninformative</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para><Para id="_344">Finally, the process of taking the family history has a psychosocial dimension. Discussing and documenting discrete aspects of family relationships and health brings the family into the session symbolically, even when a single person is being counseled. Problems that may be encountered in eliciting a family history and constructing a pedigree include difficulty contacting relatives with whom one has little or no relationship, differing views between family members about the value of genetic information, resistance to discussion of cancer and cancer-related illness, unanticipated discovery of previously unknown medical or family information, and coercion of one relative by another regarding testing decisions. In addition, unexpected emotional distress may be experienced by the consultand in the process of gathering family history information.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1284"><Title>Indications for referral to cancer risk assessment and counseling</Title><Para id="_1353">After an individual’s personal and family cancer histories have been collected, several factors could warrant referral to a genetics professional for evaluation of hereditary cancer susceptibility syndromes.

Diagnostic criteria for different hereditary syndromes incorporate different
features from the list above, depending on the original purpose of defining the syndrome (e.g., for gene mapping, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000660739">genotype</GlossaryTermRef>-<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460203">phenotype</GlossaryTermRef> studies,
epidemiological investigations, population screening, or clinical service). 
Thus, a syndrome such as Lynch syndrome (also called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer [HNPCC]) can
be defined for research purposes by the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_1124" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Amsterdam criteria</SummaryRef> as having three
related individuals with colorectal cancer,  with one person being a first-degree relative of the other two; spanning two generations; and including one person who was younger

limitations in the clinical setting, however, in that they ignore endometrial
and other extracolonic tumors known to be important features of Lynch syndrome. 
Revised published criteria that consider extracolonic cancers of Lynch syndrome have been subsequently developed and include the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_1127" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Amsterdam criteria II</SummaryRef> and the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_1130" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">revised Bethesda guidelines</SummaryRef>.</Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>What could make the family history difficult to interpret?</Strong><Para id="_64">Other factors may complicate recognition of

family.  Mendel’s laws of inheritance posit that genetic factors are
transmitted from parents to offspring as discrete units known as genes that are
inherited independently from each other and are passed on from an older
generation to the following generation.  The most common forms of Mendelian
inheritance are <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339338">autosomal dominant</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339339">autosomal recessive</GlossaryTermRef>, and X-linked.  Non-Mendelian forms of inheritance include chromosomal,
complex, and mitochondrial. Researchers have learned from cancer and other inherited
diseases that even Mendelian inheritance is modified by environmental and other genetic factors and that there are variations in the ways that the laws of inheritance work.<Reference refidx="56"/><Reference refidx="57"/><Reference refidx="58"/>

</ListTitle><ListItem>Autosomal dominant inheritance refers to disorders that are expressed in the
heterozygote (i.e., the affected person has one copy of a mutated <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339337">allele</GlossaryTermRef> and one
allele that is functioning normally).  Autosomal dominant inheritance is
characterized by the following:
<ItemizedList id="_50" Style="dash" Compact="No"><ListItem>Vertical occurrence (i.e., seen in successive generations).

ovarian cancer syndrome, Lynch syndrome, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460148">familial</GlossaryTermRef> adenomatous polyposis, and von Hippel Lindau disease.
</ListItem>
<ListItem>It is possible for an individual to have a mutation in a gene that has not

<ItemizedList id="_52" Style="dash" Compact="No"><ListItem>Horizontal occurrence (i.e., seen in one generation only [affected siblings in the absence of affected parents]); generally  not seen in successive generations.

<ListItem>Mutated genes must come from both sides of the family (i.e., biparental

inquiries about birth defects and intellectual disability are important for thorough pedigree construction and interpretation.  Examples of chromosomal disorders with increased risk of malignancy
include leukemia associated with Down syndrome (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460223">trisomy</GlossaryTermRef> 21) and breast cancer associated with Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY karyotype).

responsible for the condition.  Rather, the net effect of genetic, lifestyle,
and environmental factors determines a person’s liability to be affected with a
condition, such as cancer.
<Para id="_57">Susceptibility or resistance shows a more or less normal distribution in the
population.  Most people have an intermediate susceptibility, with those at the
tails of the distribution curve having unusually low or unusually high
susceptibility.  Affected individuals are presumably those who are past a point
of threshold for being affected due to their particular combination of risk
factors.  Outside of the few known Mendelian syndromes that predispose to a high
incidence of specific cancer, most cancers are complex in
etiology.
</Para><Para id="_58">Clustering of cancer among relatives is common, but teasing out the underlying
causes when there is no clear pattern is more difficult.  With many common malignancies, such as lung cancer,  an excess of cancers in
relatives can be seen.  These familial aggregations are seen as being due
to combinations of exposures to known carcinogens, such as tobacco smoke, and to mutations in high penetrance genes or alterations in genes with low
penetrance that affect the metabolism of the carcinogens in question.<Reference refidx="60"/></Para><Para id="_1239">The general practitioner is likely to encounter some families with a strong <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460153">genetic predisposition</GlossaryTermRef> to cancer and the recognition of cancer susceptibility may have dramatic consequences for a given individual's health and management.
Although mutations in major cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460209">susceptibility genes</GlossaryTermRef> lead to recognizable
Mendelian inheritance patterns, they are uncommon. Nonetheless, cancer susceptibility genes are estimated to contribute to the occurrence of organ-specific cancers from less than 1% to up to 15%.<Reference refidx="61"/>  Mutations in
these genes confer high relative risk and high absolute risk.  The
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000485393"> attributable risk</GlossaryTermRef> is low, however, because they are so rare.</Para><Para id="_60">In contrast, scientists now know of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044805">polymorphisms</GlossaryTermRef> or alterations in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044393">deoxyribonucleic acid</GlossaryTermRef>  that
are very common in the general population.  Each
polymorphism may confer low relative and absolute risks, but collectively they
may account for high attributable risk because they are so common.  Development
of clinically significant disease in the presence of certain genetic polymorphisms may be
highly dependent on environmental exposure to a potent carcinogen.  People
carrying polymorphisms associated with weak disease susceptibility may
constitute a target group for whom avoidance of carcinogen exposure may be
highly useful in preventing full-blown disease from occurring.

Methods to calculate risk utilize health history information and risk factor and family history data often in combination with emerging biologic and genetic/genomic evidence to establish predictions.<Reference refidx="62"/>  Multiple methodologies are used to calculate risk, including statistical models, prevalence data from specific populations, penetrance data when a documented <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000556486">deleterious mutation</GlossaryTermRef> has been identified in a family, Mendelian inheritance, and Bayesian analysis.  All models have distinct capabilities, weaknesses, and limitations based on the methodology, sample size, and/or population used to create the model.

The key to  using specific models or prevalence data is to apply the model or statistics only in the population best suited for its use.  For instance, a model or prevalence data derived from a population study of individuals older than 35 years may not accurately be applied in a population aged 35 years and younger.   Care must be taken when interpreting the data obtained from various risk models because they differ with regard to what is actually being estimated. Some models estimate the risk of a mutation being present in the family; others estimate the risk of a mutation being present in the individual being counseled. Some models estimate the risk of specific cancers developing in an individual, while others estimate more than one of the data above.

Other important considerations include critical family constructs, which can significantly impact model reliability, such as small family size or male-dominated families when the cancer risks are predominately female in origin, adoption, and early deaths from other causes.<Reference refidx="64"/><Reference refidx="65"/>  In addition, most models provide gene and/or syndrome-specific probabilities but do not account for the possibility that the personal and/or family history of cancer may be conferred by an as-yet-unidentified cancer susceptibility gene.<Reference refidx="66"/>  In the absence of a documented mutation in the family, critical assessment of the personal and family history is essential in determining the usefulness and limitations of probability estimates used to aid in the decisions regarding indications for genetic testing.<Reference refidx="63"/><Reference refidx="64"/><Reference refidx="66"/> </Para><Para id="_293">When a deleterious mutation has been identified in a family and a test report documents that finding, prior probabilities can be ascertained with a greater degree of reliability.  In this setting, probabilities can be calculated based on the pattern of inheritance associated with the gene in which the mutation has been identified.

In the presence of a documented deleterious mutation, cancer risk estimates can be derived from peer-reviewed penetrance data.<Reference refidx="4"/>  Penetrance data are constantly being refined and many gene mutations have variable penetrance because other variables may impact the absolute risk of cancer in any given patient.  Modifiers of cancer risk in mutation carriers include the mutation's effect on the function of the gene/protein (e.g., mutation type and position), the contributions of modifier genes, and personal and environmental factors (e.g., the impact of bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy performed for other indications in a woman who harbors a <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> mutation).<Reference refidx="69"/>  When there is evidence of an inherited susceptibility to cancer but genetic testing has not been performed, analysis of the pedigree can be used to estimate cancer risk.

Relative risk data from studies of specific risk factors provide ratios of observed versus expected cancers associated with a given risk factor.

Careful evaluation of an individual's personal health and family history can identify other confounding risk factors that may outweigh a risk estimate derived from a cumulative risk model.

Many of the issues discussed in a counseling session may need to be revisited as new information emerges. At the end of the counseling process, individuals are typically reminded of the possibility that future research may provide new options and/or new information on risk. Individuals may be advised to check in with the health care provider periodically to determine whether new information is sufficient to merit an additional counseling session. The obligation of health care providers to recontact individuals when new genetic testing or treatment options are available is controversial, and standards have not been established.</Para><SummarySection id="_354"><Title>Methods of Risk Presentation</Title><Para id="_355">The usage of numerical probabilities to communicate risk may overestimate the level of risk certainty, especially when wide confidence intervals exist to the estimates or when the individual may differ in important ways from the sample on which the risk estimate was derived.  Also, numbers are often inadequate for expressing gut-level or emotional aspects of risk.  Finally, there are wide variations  in individuals’ level of understanding of mathematical concepts (i.e., numeracy).  For all the above reasons, conveying risk in multiple ways, both numerically and verbally, with discussion of important caveats, may be a useful strategy to increase risk comprehension.  The numerical format that facilitates the best understanding is natural frequencies because frequencies include information concerning the denominator, the reference group to which the individual may refer.  In general, logarithmic scales are to be avoided.<Reference refidx="2"/>  Additionally, important “contextual” risks may be included with the frequency in order to increase risk comprehension; these may include how the person’s risk compares with those who do not have the risk factor in question and the risks associated with common hazards, such as being in a car accident.  Additional suggestions include being consistent in risk formats (do not mix odds and percentages), using the same denominator across risk estimates, avoiding decimal points, including base rate information, and providing more explanation if the risk is less than 1%.</Para><Para id="_356">The communication of risk may be numerical, verbal, or visual. Use of multiple strategies may increase comprehension and retention of cancer genetic risk information.<Reference refidx="2"/> Recently, use of visual risk communication strategies has increased (e.g., histograms, pie charts, and Venn diagrams).  Visual depictions of risk may be very useful in avoiding problems with comprehension of numbers, but research that confirms this is lacking.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> A  study published in 2008 examined the use of two different visual aids to communicate breast cancer risk. Women at an increased risk of breast cancer were randomized to receive feedback via a bar graph alone or a bar graph plus a frequency diagram (i.e., highlighted human figures). Results indicate that overall, there were no differences in improved accuracy of risk perception between the two groups, but among those women who inaccurately perceived very high risk at baseline, the group receiving both visual aids showed greater improvement in accuracy.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_70"><Title>Risk Communication</Title><Para id="_73">The purpose of risk counseling is to provide individuals with accurate
information about their risk, help them understand and interpret their risk, 
assist them as they use this information to make important health care decisions,
and  help them make the best possible adjustment to their situation.
A systematic review of 28 studies that evaluated communication interventions showed that risk communication benefits users cognitively by increasing their knowledge and understanding of risk perception and does not negatively influence affect (anxiety, cancer-related worry, and depression).  Risk communication does not appear to result in a change in use of screening practices and tests.  Users received the most benefit from an approach utilizing risk communication along with genetic counseling.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/> Perceptions of risk are affected by the manner in which risk information is presented, difficulty understanding
probability and heredity,<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/> and other psychological processes on the part of
individuals and providers.<Reference refidx="10"/> Risk may be communicated in many ways (e.g., with numbers, words, or
graphics; alone or in relation to other risks; as the probability of having an adverse event; in relative or absolute terms; and through
combinations of these methods).  The way in which risk information is
communicated may affect the individual’s perception of the magnitude of that
risk.  In general, relative risk estimates (e.g., "You have a threefold increased risk of colorectal cancer") are perceived as less informative
than absolute risk (e.g., "You have a 25% risk of colorectal cancer") <Reference refidx="11"/> or risk information presented as a ratio (e.g., 1 in 4).<Reference refidx="9"/> A strong preference
for having <GeneName>BRCA1/2</GeneName> mutation risk estimates expressed numerically is reported by
women considering testing.<Reference refidx="12"/> Individuals associate widely differing
quantitative risks with qualitative descriptors of risk such as “rare” or
“common.”<Reference refidx="13"/> More research is needed on the best methods of communicating risk in order to help individuals develop an accurate understanding of their cancer risks.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_218"><Title>Communication Strategies</Title><Para id="_219">Recent descriptive examination of the process of cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044961">genetic counseling</GlossaryTermRef> has found that counseling sessions are predominantly focused on the biomedical teaching required to inform clients of their choices and to put genetic findings in perspective but that attention to psychosocial issues does not detract from teaching goals and may enhance satisfaction in clients undergoing counseling.  For instance, one study of communication patterns in 167 pretest counseling sessions for <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> found the sessions to have a predominantly biomedical and educational focus;<Reference refidx="14"/> however, this approach was client focused, with the counselor and client contributing equally to the dialogue.  These authors note that there was a marked diversity in counselor styles, both between counselors and within different sessions, for each counselor.  The finding of a didactic style was corroborated by other researchers who examined observer-rated content checklists and videotape of 51 counseling sessions for breast cancer susceptibility.<Reference refidx="15"/>  Of note, genetic counselors seemed to rely on demographic information and breast cancer history to tailor genetic counseling sessions rather than client’s self-reported expectations or psychosocial factors.<Reference refidx="16"/>  Concurrent provision of  psychosocial and scientific information may be important in reducing worry in the context of counseling about cancer genetics topics.<Reference refidx="17"/>  An increasing appreciation of language choices may contribute to enhanced understanding and reduced anxiety levels in the session; for example, it was noted that patients may appreciate synonymic choices for the word “mutation,” such as “altered gene”.<Reference refidx="18"/> Some authors have published recommendations for cultural tailoring of educational materials for the African-American population, such as a large flip chart, including the use of simple language and pictures, culturally identifiable images (e.g., spiritual symbols and tribal patterns), bright colors, and humor.<Reference refidx="19"/></Para><Para id="_357"> Literature  that examines novel channels to communicate genetic cancer risk information, deliver psychosocial support, and  standardize the genetic counseling process for individuals at increased risk of cancer is being developed.<Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/>   Much of this literature has attempted to make the genetic counseling session more efficient or to limit the need for the counselor to address basic genetic principles in the session to free up time for the client’s personal and emotional concerns about his or her risk.  For example, the receipt of genetic feedback for <GeneName>BRCA1/2</GeneName> and mismatch repair gene testing by letter, rather than a face-to-face genetic counseling feedback session, has been investigated.<Reference refidx="28"/>   Other modalities include the development of checklists, CD-ROM programs, and interactive computer programs.  Checklists have been developed to ensure coverage of important topics in the counseling session and include those completed by observers or by the patients themselves to clarify their goals and needs in the counseling session.    One study compared a feedback checklist completed by 197 women attending a high-risk breast clinic prior to the counseling session to convey prior genetic knowledge and misconceptions to aid the counselor in tailoring the session for that client.<Reference refidx="22"/> The use of the feedback checklist led to gains in knowledge from the counseling session but did not reduce genetic counseling time, perhaps because the genetic counselor chose to spend time discussing topics such as psychosocial issues.  Use of the checklist did decrease the time spent with the medical oncologist, however.  The feedback checklist was compared to a CD-ROM that outlined basic genetic concepts and the benefits and limitations of testing and found that those viewing the CD-ROM spent less time with counselors and were less likely to choose to undergo genetic testing.  The CD-ROM did not lead to increased knowledge of genetic concepts, as did use of the checklist.   </Para><Para id="_1248">A prospective study evaluated the effects of a CD-ROM decisional support aid for microsatellite instability (MSI) tumor testing  in 239 colorectal cancer patients who met the revised Bethesda criteria  but who did not meet the Amsterdam criteria.<Reference refidx="29"/> The study also tested a theoretical model of factors influencing decisional conflict surrounding decisions to pursue MSI tumor testing. Within the study, half of the sample was randomly assigned to receive a brief description of MSI testing within the clinical encounter, and the other half was provided the CD-ROM decisional support aid in addition to the brief description.  The CD-ROM and brief description intervention increased knowledge about MSI testing more than the brief description alone did. As a result, decisional conflict decreased because participants felt more prepared to make a decision about the test and had increased perceived benefits of MSI testing. </Para><Para id="_358">Other innovative strategies include educational materials and interactive computer technology.  In one study, a 13-page color communication aid using a diverse format for conveying risk, including graphic representations and verbal descriptions, was developed.<Reference refidx="23"/> The authors evaluated the influence of the communication aid in 27 women at high risk of a <GeneName>BRCA1/2</GeneName> mutation and compared those who had read the aid to a comparison sample of 107 women who received standard genetic counseling.  Improvements in genetic knowledge and accuracy of risk perception were documented in those who had read the aid, with no differences in anxiety or depression between groups.

In 37 individuals in the United Kingdom, real-time video conferencing was compared with face-to-face counseling sessions; both methods were found to improve knowledge and reduce anxiety levels.<Reference refidx="26"/>  Similarly, teleconferencing sessions, in which the client and genetic specialists were able to talk with each other in real time, were used in rural Maine communities <Reference refidx="27"/> in the pediatric context to convey genetic information and findings for developmental delays and were found to be comparable to in-person consultations in terms of decision-making confidence and satisfaction with the consultations. An Australian study compared  the experiences of 106 women who received hereditary breast and ovarian cancer genetic counseling via videoconferencing with the experiences of   89 women who received counseling face to face.  Pre- and 1-month postcounseling assessments revealed no significant differences in knowledge gains, satisfaction, cancer-specific anxiety,  generalized anxiety, depression, and perceived empathy of the genetic counselor.<Reference refidx="30"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Baker DL, Schuette JL, Uhlmann WR, eds.: A Guide to Genetic Counseling.

to determine whether a genetic basis for the cancer diagnosis can be
established.  Three possible outcomes for this form of testing include the following (see Figure 2):</Para><ItemizedList id="_314" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Deleterious mutation detected.</ListItem><ListItem>No mutation detected.</ListItem><ListItem><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000556495">Variant of uncertain significance</GlossaryTermRef> (VUS) detected.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_1099">If a mutation that is documented to be deleterious (associated with cancer risk) is

This result means that a gene mutation has been found; however, the extent that this mutation increases cancer risk, or whether it is associated with the history of cancer in the family, is uncertain.  In this circumstance, some clues as to the significance of the mutation can be derived from the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_1093" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>The location of the mutation in relation to regions and function of a gene.</ListItem><ListItem>The specific change; since many variants are <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460164">missense mutations</GlossaryTermRef>, not all amino acid substitutions are as significant.</ListItem><ListItem>Whether the variant has been documented in the presence of a documented deleterious mutation.</ListItem><ListItem>Whether the mutation is associated with the branch in the family with the cancer and/or whether the variant tracks with the cancers in the family.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_1094">Unfortunately, even with this information, there is often insufficient evidence to document the significance of a specific variant, and further clarifying research is required.</Para><Para id="_85">If there is no close, living, affected relative to undergo testing, or the living affected relative declines testing, other options may be

unaffected person without prior testing of an affected family member.  Tests
done on stored tissue are technically difficult and may not yield a definitive
result.  Testing an unaffected person without prior testing of an affected
relative often is uninformative because a negative test does not rule out the
presence of a cancer susceptibility gene in the family or the subject.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_307"><Title>Testing in families with a documented deleterious mutation</Title><Para id="_308">Genetic susceptibility testing for a documented deleterious mutation in the family can be very <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460156">informative</GlossaryTermRef> and will yield one of the following  two results (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062865#_1095" url="/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/risk-assessment-pdq">Figure 2</SummaryRef>):</Para><ItemizedList id="_309" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Positive for the familial mutation.</ListItem><ListItem>Negative for the familial mutation.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_310">If the familial mutation is detected in a family member, their cancer risks are based on penetrance data for mutations in that specific gene.

A given test is usually performed in
only a small number of laboratories.  There are also multiple molecular testing
methods available, each with its own indications, costs, strengths, and weaknesses.
Depending on the method employed and the extent of the analysis, different
tests for the same gene will have varying levels of sensitivity and
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000322884">specificity</GlossaryTermRef>.  Even assuming high analytic validity, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339333">genetic heterogeneity</GlossaryTermRef> makes
test selection challenging.  A number of different genetic syndromes may
underlie the development of a particular cancer type.  For example, hereditary colon
cancer may be due to familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Lynch syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, juvenile
polyposis syndrome, or other syndromes.  Each of these has a different
genetic basis.  In addition, different genes may be responsible for the same
condition (e.g., Lynch syndrome can be caused by mutations in one of several mismatch
repair [MMR] genes).  </Para><Para id="_1209">In some genes, the same mutation has been found in multiple, apparently unrelated families. This observation is consistent with a founder effect, wherein a mutation identified in a contemporary population can be traced back to a small group of founders isolated by geographic, cultural, or other factors. For example, two specific <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> mutations (185delAG and 5382insC) and one <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutation (6174delT) have been reported to be common in Ashkenazi Jews. Other genes also have reported <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000570712">founder mutations</GlossaryTermRef>. The presence of founder mutations has practical implications for genetic testing. Many laboratories offer directed testing specifically for ethnic-specific <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339337">alleles</GlossaryTermRef>. This greatly simplifies the technical aspects of the test but is not without limitations. For example, approximately 15% of <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutations that occur among Ashkenazim are nonfounder mutations.<Reference refidx="7"/>  Also, for genes in which large genome rearrangements are founder mutations, ordering additional testing using different techniques may be needed.   </Para><Para id="_1210"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460125">Allelic heterogeneity</GlossaryTermRef> (i.e., different mutations
within the same gene) can confer different risks or be associated with a
different phenotype.  For example, though the general rule is that <GeneName>adenomatous
polyposis coli</GeneName> (<GeneName>APC</GeneName>) gene mutations are associated with hundreds or thousands of
colonic polyps and colon cancer of the classical FAP syndrome, some <GeneName>APC</GeneName>
mutations cause a milder clinical picture, with fewer polyps and lower
colorectal cancer risk.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/>    In addition, other disorders may be part of the FAP
spectrum.  Mutations in a certain portion of the <GeneName>APC</GeneName> gene also predispose to
retinal changes, for example, when mutations in a different region of <GeneName>APC</GeneName>
predispose to desmoid tumors.  Thus, selection of the appropriate genetic test
for a given individual requires considerable knowledge of genetic diagnostic
methods, correlation between clinical and molecular findings, and access to
information about rapidly changing testing options.  These issues are addressed
in detail in PDQ summaries on the genetics of specific cancers.

CLIA regulations address personnel qualifications, laboratory quality assurance standards, and documentation and validation of tests and procedures.<Reference refidx="11"/>  For laboratory tests themselves, CLIA categorizes tests based on the level of complexity into waived tests, moderate complexity, or high complexity.  Genetic tests are considered high complexity, which indicates that a high degree of knowledge and skill is required to perform or interpret the test.  Laboratories conducting high complexity tests must undergo proficiency testing at specified intervals, which consists of an external review of the laboratory's ability to accurately perform and interpret the test.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="12"/> However, a specialty area specific for molecular and biologic genetic tests has yet to be established; therefore, specific proficiency testing of genetic testing laboratories is not required by CLIA.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_288">In regard to analytic validity, genetic tests fall into two primary categories; test kits and laboratory-developed tests (previously called home brews).  Test kits are manufactured for use in laboratories performing the test and include all the reagents necessary to complete the analysis, instructions, performance outcomes, and details about which mutations can be detected.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates test kits as medical devices; however, despite more than 1,000 available genetic tests, there are fewer than ten FDA-approved test kits.<Reference refidx="12"/> Laboratory-developed tests are performed in a laboratory that assembles its own testing materials in-house;<Reference refidx="12"/> this category represents the most common form of genetic testing.  Laboratory-developed tests are subject to the least amount of oversight, as neither CLIA nor the FDA evaluate the laboratories' proficiency in performing the test or clinical validity relative to the accuracy of the test to predict a clinical outcome.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="12"/>  The FDA does regulate manufactured analyte-specific reagents (ASRs) as medical devices.  These small molecules are used to conduct laboratory-developed tests but can also be made by the laboratory.  ASRs made in the laboratory are not subject to FDA oversight.  For laboratory-developed tests utilizing manufactured commercially available ASRs, the FDA requires that the test be ordered by a health professional or other individual authorized to order the test by state law.  However, this regulation does not distinguish between health providers caring for the patient or health providers who work for the laboratory offering the test.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_289">In addition to classical clinical genetic tests is the regulatory oversight of research genetic testing. Laboratories performing genetic testing on a research basis are exempt from CLIA oversight if the laboratory does not report patient-specific results for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of any disease or impairment or the assessment of the health of individual patients.<Reference refidx="10"/>  However, there are anecdotal reports of research laboratories providing test results for clinical purposes with the caveat that the laboratory recommends that testing be repeated in a clinical CLIA-approved laboratory.  In addition, there is no established mechanism that determines when a test has sufficient analytic and clinical validity to be offered clinically.<Reference refidx="12"/>  Currently, the decision to offer a genetic test clinically is at the discretion of the laboratory director.</Para><Para id="_290">Evidence regarding the implications of this narrow regulatory oversight of genetic tests is limited and consists predominately of laboratory director responses to quality assurance surveys.  A survey of 133 laboratory directors performing genetic tests found that 88% of laboratories employed one or more American Board of Medical Genetics (ABMG)-certified or ABMG-eligible professional geneticists, and 23% had an affiliation with at least one doctoral-prepared geneticist.  Eight percent of laboratories did not employ and were not affiliated with doctoral-level genetics professionals.  Laboratory-developed tests were performed in 70% of laboratories.  Sixty-three percent of laboratories provided an interpretation of the test result as part of the test report.<Reference refidx="13"/>  Another survey of 190 laboratory directors found that 97% were CLIA-certified for high complexity testing.  Sixteen percent of laboratories reported no specialty area certification; those without specialty certification represented laboratories with the most volume of tests performed and offered the most extensive test selection.<Reference refidx="10"/>  Of laboratories with specialty certification, not all had certification relevant to genetic tests, with 48% reporting pathology certification, 46% chemistry certification, and 41% clinical <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000270737">cytogenetics</GlossaryTermRef> certification.  Sixteen percent of directors reported participation in no formal external proficiency testing program, although 77% performed some informal proficiency testing when a formal external proficiency testing program was not available.  </Para><Para id="_350">The most frequent reason cited for lack of proficiency testing participation was lack of available proficiency testing programs.  Laboratory directors estimated that in the past 2 years 37% issued three or fewer incorrect reports, and 35% issued at least four incorrect reports. Analytic errors such as faulty reagent, equipment failure, or human error, increased 40% with each decrease in level of proficiency training completed.<Reference refidx="10"/>  An international genetic testing laboratory director survey involving 18 countries found that 64% of the 827 laboratories that responded accepted samples from outside their country.<Reference refidx="14"/>   Similar to the U.S. study, 74% reported participation in some form of proficiency testing.  Fifty-three percent of the laboratories required a copy of the consent to perform the test, and 72% of laboratories retained specimens indefinitely that were submitted for testing.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para><Para id="_1089">The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health, and Society has published a <ExternalRef xref="http://oba.od.nih.gov/oba/SACGHS/reports/SACGHS_oversight_report.pdf">detailed report</ExternalRef> regarding the adequacy and transparency of the current oversight system for genetic testing in the United States.

The ASHG statement <Reference refidx="21"/> recommended a series of standards in the area of transparency, provider education, and test and laboratory quality, and concluded that further research and federal oversight are needed in this rapidly changing field.

There are two approaches to targeting consumers with information about DTC genetic tests. The first is called DTC advertising, which promotes the availability of a genetic test to the public but requires involvement of a health care provider to order the test and disseminate the results to the consumer. The second approach, DTC genetic testing, is discussed below.<Reference refidx="25"/>  While numerous position papers, review articles, and commentaries have been published, there are few empirical examples about the impact of DTC advertising of genetic tests on patients, providers, or the health care system. The most studied example to date is the Myriad Genetics campaign to increase awareness of <GeneName>BRCA1/2</GeneName> mutation testing through multiple mass media outlets (print, radio, and television). In 2002, Myriad launched its first DTC marketing campaign in Denver and Atlanta. The target audience for this campaign was women from the general population aged 25 to 54 years. In May 2002, Myriad began with educational outreach to providers in the two cities in anticipation of patient requests for information spurred by the DTC campaign, which ran from September 2002 to February 2003. The campaign included television, radio, and print advertisements that were expected to reach greater than 90% of the target audience an average of 16 times during the 5-month period.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/> Subsequently, these DTC campaigns have been conducted in the northeast, Texas, and Florida.  These campaigns were immediately criticized for providing incomplete, manipulative information.<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/></Para><Para id="_1118">Empirical research was conducted immediately following the 2002 campaign. A random digit dialing survey  of 1,635 women in the campaign cities (Denver and Atlanta) and two control cities found increased levels of awareness of <GeneName>BRCA1/2</GeneName> genetic testing in target cities.<Reference refidx="30"/> However, no significant differences were observed in perceived knowledge about testing, concern about breast cancer, or interest in testing.  There was no evidence that knowledge was differentially increased in those women with strong family histories of breast cancer, who would most benefit from consideration of testing.<Reference refidx="30"/>  No overall increase in anxiety or confusion about testing was reported. Of women who reported exposure to the DTC advertisement, 63%  reported no anxiety at all, and 76% reported no confusion.<Reference refidx="26"/>  A smaller study of 315 women from the Denver area found that women at increased risk of breast cancer were more knowledgeable about <GeneName>BRCA</GeneName> testing and more likely to recall the advertisement.  However, an equal number of high and low risk women felt they would benefit from genetic testing and were interested in testing.<Reference refidx="31"/> A consumer survey based on a cross-sectional, stratified, random sample of at-risk women  explored the effects of socioeconomic status (SES) on women’s reactions to a <GeneName>BRCA1/BRCA2</GeneName> genetic testing DTC marketing campaign.<Reference refidx="32"/> The survey was conducted at two intervention sites (n = 811) and two control sites (n = 824), and knowledge of the genetic test, perceptions of personal risk, communications with others about the test, and interest in pursuing the test were evaluated. SES, as measured by income and education, had no differential effect on any of the outcome measures in women at the intervention sites and control sites. However, the study did report a consistent overall effect of SES on most variables measured, independent of the intervention site. For example, women of lower SES reported being less knowledgeable about genetics and risk, yet were more interested in genetic testing. These results suggest that SES could play a role in access to genetic services, how women understand their genetic risk of inherited breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility, and what they do about it.</Para><Para id="_1119">The impact of the advertising campaign on physicians was also a focus of investigation. Physicians in target cities were more likely to remember hearing an advertisement for testing but did not have increased knowledge compared with physicians in control cities.  Physicians in target cities reported increases in patients’ questions about genetic testing, genetic counseling referrals, and requests for testing.<Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="33"/>  In summary, physicians might have been more likely to make a referral for testing based on the patient’s interest in testing, whether or not the doctor is informed enough to consider whether the test is appropriate.  The most concerning documented problem with this campaign was that the company targeted the general population, even though genetic testing for <GeneName>BRCA1/2</GeneName> is only appropriate for a subgroup of women.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para><Para id="_1120">In addition to the data from the Myriad campaign, one international study examined the impact of a DTC campaign for genetic testing by a group of researchers in partnership with a popular Polish women’s magazine (<Emphasis>Twoj Styl</Emphasis>).  Genetic testing was offered to 5,000 women through an announcement placed in <Emphasis>Twoj Styl</Emphasis> in October 2001.  A total of 5,024 women who qualified received a free genetic test for three <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> mutations that are common in Poland. Genetic counseling was offered only to women with a positive test or with a significant family history of breast or ovarian cancer. The great majority of women who took part in the program expressed a high degree of satisfaction, and after 1 year, approximately two-thirds of identified mutation carriers had complied with breast cancer screening recommendations.<Reference refidx="34"/>  No follow-up with women who received a negative test result to assess understanding of their results was conducted   nor was subsequent follow-up conducted regarding population screening recommendations.</Para><SummarySection id="_1121"><Title>Research examining DTC testing</Title><Para id="_1122">DTC genetic testing is advertised directly to consumers, purchased directly by the consumer, and the results are delivered directly to the consumer without the involvement of the consumer’s health care provider.<Reference refidx="25"/>  Some might suggest that DTC genetic tests promise heightened privacy and the potential that individuals will be more informed and more able to take an active, decision-making role in their medical options.<Reference refidx="35"/></Para><Para id="_1193">DTC laboratories predominantly rely on Web material to disseminate test information to consumers. One study evaluated how using a Web-based decision tool that provided information about a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000699860">multiplex genetic susceptibility test</GlossaryTermRef> influenced participants’ testing decisions.<Reference refidx="36"/> The Web-based tool was developed specifically for the study by an interdisciplinary research team and was designed using principles of health literacy, communication, and prior research.  The tool implemented a layered menu approach that allowed participants to select the order and amount of content viewed. Participants included 526 members of a large Midwestern health maintenance organization ranging in age from 25 to 40 years with no evidence of any of the health conditions included in the test.  
Participants most frequently viewed the Web pages describing the test, testing procedures, and implications of the results and less frequently viewed the pages about specific health conditions or genes. Participants viewed an average of eight Web pages (mean 8.2, standard deviation 7.2, range 1–27), including an average of 2.9 of the 4 pages introducing the multiplex test, 2.2 of the 8 pages describing the health conditions on the test, and 3.2 of the 15 pages describing the genes, out of a possible 27 total pages.  The number of Web pages viewed was significantly associated with ease of decision making (odds ratio,    1.04; 95% CI, 1.01–1.07).
  </Para><Para id="_1123">There is growing interest in trying to use genetic information to guide decisions about healthy lifestyle, including dietary choice, although there is no evidence base for implementing such practices. A 2006 study of consumer and physician awareness of DTC nutrigenomic tests found that 14% of consumers and 44% of physicians had heard of the tests, but actual utilization was exceedingly low (0.6% of consumers had used one).<Reference refidx="37"/> This study examines awareness of nutrigenomic testing in Michigan, Oregon, and Utah via the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System. Awareness was highest in Oregon (24.4%) and Utah (19.7%) and lowest in Michigan (7.6%). Those who had higher incomes, greater education, and increasing age (except those older than 65 years) were more aware of nutrigenomic tests.<Reference refidx="38"/> Of those consumers who had heard of DTC nutrigenomic tests, 46% had heard about them from television, 35% from magazines, 29% from newspapers, and only 13% from health professionals.  There was great variation in the extent to which background information concerning the disease in question was presented. For example, more than half of these companies offered information about disease etiology, but far fewer offered information about diagnosis and treatment or prevention.  Companies providing tests of little clinical utility (such as enhancement tests) tended to provide more detailed information, although the information provided about the diseases and genetics in general was not always accurate, as clinical validity claims were supported by peer-reviewed literature in only approximately half the companies.  The trend identified in this survey of available companies indicates that the tests with the least clinical utility are provided with the least professional oversight and counseling services.</Para><Para id="_1164">A study of 1,087 users of  Facebook, a social-networking Web site, who proactively registered with a marketing firm indicated that almost half of respondents were aware of personal genetic testing (PGT).<Reference refidx="39"/>  Fewer than 10% of respondents had used PGT for a variety of conditions, including, but not limited to, cancer; however, the majority indicated that they would consider using PGT (64%). The study also identified key areas in which individuals may benefit from additional education and information. For example, one-third of respondents mistakenly understood that the PGT results indicated a diagnosis of disease as opposed to risk of developing disease. In addition,  respondents viewed physicians as an important resource in understanding and using PGT results to make health care decisions.</Para><Para id="_1249">Another study examined how 145 Facebook users interpreted DTC information. Participants completed an online survey in which separate scenarios containing information derived from DTC Web sites about the risk of developing heart disease, colorectal cancer, or basal cell skin cancer were presented. The authors found that even in this highly educated cohort, of whom 56% were in the health care field, the reported ease of understanding the test results was not related to an accurate interpretation of the results.<Reference refidx="40"/>   Of those who answered that the results were easy or very easy to understand for each of the scenarios, correct interpretation varied greatly (59%–80%) across the four scenarios.</Para><Para id="_1223"> A study offered DTC genomic risk assessments at reduced  cost to 3,640 highly educated (90% had some college or more), high-income (median, $100,000–$149,000 per year), predominantly white (80%) employees in the health care (the sponsoring institution), technology, and biotechnology fields.<Reference refidx="41"/>  Those who declined participation were more likely to be nonwhite.  Among those who underwent DTC testing, about half (49.7%) expressed testing-related concerns; the most frequently cited concerns involved privacy issues.  In multivariate analyses,  female gender, employment in a health care field, younger age, higher education, and higher trait anxiety were significant predictors of expressing concerns about testing.  The majority (82.4%) indicated that they would want to know their genetic risk of a nonpreventable disease. Women, whites, those who were  younger, those who were in health-related occupations, and those who had higher trait anxiety expressed more uncertainty about whether they would want to know their genetic risk of a nonpreventable disease.</Para><Para id="_1250">Of the 56% of participants who provided a 3-month follow-up assessment, there was neither evidence of clinically meaningful distress and health behavior change (dietary fat intake, exercise) nor a statistically significant difference in screening test uptake compared with baseline measures.  Illness-specific worry was not assessed. Only 10% of participants had discussed their test results with a DTC company-specific genetic counselor; only 27% had discussed their results with their physician.<Reference refidx="42"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_226"><Title>Informed Consent</Title><Para id="_1195"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044677">Informed consent</GlossaryTermRef>  can enhance preparedness for testing, including careful weighing of benefits and limitations of testing, minimization of adverse psychosocial outcomes, appropriate use of medical options, and a strengthened provider-patient relationship based on honesty, support, and trust.</Para><Para id="_227">Consensus exists among experts that a process of informed consent should be
an integral part of the pretest counseling process.<Reference refidx="43"/>  This view is driven
by several ethical dilemmas that can arise in genetic susceptibility testings.  The most commonly cited concern is the
possibility of insurance or employment discrimination if a test result, or even
the fact that an individual has sought or is seeking testing, is disclosed.  In 2008, Congress passed the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062865#_391" url="/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/risk-assessment-pdq">Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA)</SummaryRef>. This federal law provides protections related to health insurance and employment discrimination based on genetic information. However, GINA does not cover life, disability, or long-term-care insurance discrimination.<Reference refidx="44"/>   A related issue involves
stigmatization that may occur when an individual who may never develop the
condition in question, or may not do so for decades, receives genetic
information and is labeled or labels himself or herself as ill.  Finally, in the case
of genetic testing, medical information given to one individual
has immediate implications for biologic relatives.  These implications include
not only the medical risks but also disruptions in familial relationships.  The
possibility for coercion exists when one family member wants to be tested but,
to do so optimally, must first obtain genetic material or information from
other family members.</Para><Para id="_228">Inclusion of an informed consent process in counseling can facilitate patient autonomy.<Reference refidx="45"/>  It may also reduce the potential for misunderstanding
between patient and provider.  Many clinical programs provide opportunities for
individuals to review their informed consent during the genetic testing and
counseling process.  Initial informed consent provides a
verbal and/or written overview of the process.  </Para><Para id="_229">Some programs use a second informed consent process prior to disclosure to the
individual of his or her genetic test results.  This process allows for the possibility
that a person may change his or her mind about receiving test results.  After
the test result has been disclosed, a third informed consent discussion often
occurs.  This discussion concerns issues regarding sharing the genetic test result with
health providers and/or interested family members, currently or in the future. 
Obtaining written permission to provide the test result to others in the family who are at risk can avoid vexing problems in the future should the individual not be
available to release his or her results.</Para><SummarySection id="_231"><Title>Core elements of informed consent</Title><Para id="_232">Major elements of an informed consent discussion are highlighted in the

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_233"><Title>Testing in children</Title><Para id="_234">Genetic testing for mutations in cancer susceptibility genes in children is particularly complex.  While both parents <Reference refidx="48"/> and providers <Reference refidx="49"/> may request or recommend testing for minor children, many experts recommend that unless there is evidence that the test result will influence the medical management of the child or adolescent, genetic testing should be deferred until legal adulthood (age 18 years or older) because of concerns about autonomy, potential discrimination, and possible psychosocial effects.<Reference refidx="50"/><Reference refidx="51"/><Reference refidx="52"/> A number of cancer syndromes include childhood disease risk, such as retinoblastoma, multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN)  types 1 and 2 (MEN1 and MEN2), neurofibromatosis types 1 and 2 (NF1 and NF2), Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome, Fanconi anemia, FAP, and Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL).<Reference refidx="53"/><Reference refidx="54"/>    As a consequence, decisions about genetic testing in children are made in the context of a specific gene in which a mutation is suspected.  The ASCO statement on genetic testing for cancer susceptibility maintains that the decision to consider offering childhood genetic testing should take into account not only the risk of childhood malignancy but also the evidence associated with risk reduction interventions for that disorder.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> Specifically, ASCO recommends that:</Para><ItemizedList id="_300" Style="bullet"><ListItem>When screening or preventive strategies during childhood are available (e.g., MEN and FAP), testing should be encouraged on clinical grounds.</ListItem><ListItem>When no risk reduction strategies are available in childhood and the probability of developing a malignancy during childhood is very low (e.g., hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome), testing should not be offered.</ListItem><ListItem>Some patients may be at risk of developing a malignancy during childhood without the availability of validated risk-reduction strategies (e.g., <GeneName>TP53</GeneName> mutations). The decision to test in such circumstances is particularly controversial.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_301">Special considerations are required when genetic counseling and testing for mutations in cancer susceptibility genes are considered in children.  The first issue is the age of the child.  Young children, especially those younger than 10 years, may not be involved or may have limited involvement in the decision to be tested, and some may not participate in the genetic counseling process.  In these cases, the child’s parents or other legal surrogate will be involved in the genetic counseling and will ultimately be responsible for making the decision to proceed with testing.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="55"/> Counseling under these circumstances incorporates a discussion of how test results will be shared with the child when he or she is older.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> Children aged 10 to 17 years may have more involvement in the decision-making process.<Reference refidx="56"/> In a qualitative study of parents and children aged 10 to 17 years assessing decision making for genetic research participation, older, more mature children and families with open communication styles were more likely to have joint decision making.  The majority of children in this study felt that they should have the right to make the final decision for genetic research participation, although many would seek input from their parents.<Reference refidx="56"/> While this study is specific to genetic research participation, the findings allude to the importance children aged 10 to 17 years place on personal decision making regarding factors that impact them.  Unfortunately cognitive and psychosocial development may not consistently correlate with the age of the child.<Reference refidx="55"/> Therefore, careful assessment of the child’s developmental stage may help in the genetic counseling and testing process to facilitate parent and child adaptation to the test results.  Another complicating factor includes potential risks for discrimination.

Genetic testing could interfere with the development of self-concept and self-esteem.  Children may also be at risk of developing feelings of survivor guilt or heightened anxiety.  All children are especially susceptible to not understanding the testing, results, or implications for their health.  As children mature, they begin to have decreased dependency on their parents while developing their personal identity. This can be altered in the setting of a serious health condition or an inherited disorder.  Older children are beginning to mature physically and develop intimate relationships while also changing their idealized view of their parents.  All of this can be influenced by the results of a genetic test.<Reference refidx="55"/> In its recommendations for genetic testing in asymptomatic minors, the European Society of Human Genetics emphasizes that parents have a responsibility to inform their children about their genetic risk and to communicate this information in a way that is tailored to the child’s age and developmental level.<Reference refidx="57"/><Reference refidx="58"/></Para><Para id="_303">In summary, the decision to proceed with testing in children is based on the use of the test for medical decision making for the child, the ability to interpret the test, and evidence that changes in medical decision making in childhood can positively impact health outcomes. Deferral of genetic testing is suggested when the risk of childhood malignancy is low or absent and/or there is no evidence that interventions can reduce risk.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>  When offering genetic testing in childhood, consideration of the child’s developmental stage is used to help determine his or her involvement in the testing decision and who has legal authority to provide consent.  In addition, careful attention to intrafamilial issues and potential psychosocial consequences of testing in children can enable the provider to deliver support that facilitates adaptation to the test result.

In 1995, the American Society of Human Genetics published a position statement on the ethical, legal, and psychosocial implications of genetic testing in children and adolescents as a vulnerable population.<Reference refidx="51"/>  However, vulnerable populations encompass more than just children.  Federal policy applicable to research involving human subjects, <ExternalRef xref="http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html">45 CFR Code of Federal Regulations part 46 Protection Of Human Subjects</ExternalRef>, considers the following groups as potentially vulnerable populations: prisoners, traumatized and comatose patients, terminally ill patients, elderly/aged persons who are cognitively impaired and/or institutionalized, minorities, students, employees, and individuals from outside the United States.  Specific to genetic testing, the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.isong.org/ISONG_PS_genetic_counseling_vulnerable_populations.php">International Society of Nurses in Genetics</ExternalRef> further expanded the definition of vulnerable populations to also include individuals with hearing and language deficits or conditions limiting communication (for example, language differences and concerns with reliable translation), cognitive impairment, psychiatric disturbances, clients undergoing stress due to a family situation, those without financial resources, clients with acute or chronic illness and in end-of-life, and those in whom medication may impair reasoning.   </Para><Para id="_299">Genetic counseling and testing in vulnerable populations raises special considerations.  The aim of genetic counseling is to help people understand and adapt to the medical, psychological, and familial implications of genetic contributions to disease, which in part involves the meaningful exchange of factual information.<Reference refidx="59"/>  In a vulnerable population, health care providers need to be sensitive to factors that can impact the ability of the individual to comprehend the information.  In particular, in circumstances of cognitive impairment or intellectual disability, special attention is paid to whether the individual’s legally authorized representative should be involved in the counseling, informed consent, and testing process.  </Para><Para id="_351">Providers need to assess all patients for their ability to make an uncoerced, autonomous, informed decision prior to proceeding with genetic testing.  Populations that do not seem vulnerable (e.g., legally adult college students) may actually be deemed vulnerable because of undue coercion for testing by their parents or the threat of withholding financial support by their parents based on a testing decision inconsistent with the parent’s wishes.  Alteration of the genetic counseling and testing process may be necessary depending on the situation, such as counseling and testing in terminally ill individuals who opt for testing for the benefit of their children, but given their impending death, results may have no impact on their own health care or may not be available before their death.  In summary, genetic counseling and testing requires that the health care provider assess all individuals for any evidence of vulnerability, and if present, be sensitive to those issues, modify genetic counseling based on the specific circumstances, and avoid causing additional harm.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_96"><Title>Importance of Pretest Counseling</Title><Para id="_97">The complexity of genetic testing for cancer susceptibility has led experts to
suggest that careful, in-depth counseling should precede any decision about the
use of testing, in keeping with the accepted principles for the use of genetic
testing.<Reference refidx="60"/>  For example, New York State guidelines specify that “When an increased
risk for hereditary susceptibility is identified through the individual or
family history, the clinician should initiate discussion or refer the patient
for information concerning genetic testing and its potential benefits and
burdens.  The clinician who opts to take on this responsibility must provide
the depth of content and time required to ensure that the patient can make an
informed testing choice.”<Reference refidx="46"/></Para><Para id="_98">Qualitative and quantitative research studies indicate that families hold a
variety of beliefs about the inheritance of characteristics within families;
some of these beliefs are congruent with current scientific understanding, whereas
others are not.<Reference refidx="61"/><Reference refidx="62"/><Reference refidx="63"/>  These beliefs may be influenced by education, personal
and family experiences, and cultural background.  Because behavior is
likely to be influenced by these beliefs, the usefulness of genetic information
may depend on recognizing and addressing the individual’s preexisting
cognitions.  This process begins with initial discussion and continues
throughout the genetic counseling process.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_99"><Title>Psychological Impact of Genetic Information/Test Results on the Individual
</Title><Para id="_100">An accurate assessment of psychosocial functioning and emotional factors
related to testing motivation and potential impact and utilization is an
important part of pretest counseling.<Reference refidx="64"/><Reference refidx="65"/><Reference refidx="66"/><Reference refidx="67"/><Reference refidx="68"/>  Generally, a provider inquires
about a person’s emotional response to the family history of cancer and also
about a person’s response to his or her own risk of developing cancer.  People
have various coping strategies for dealing with stressful circumstances such as
genetic risk.  Identifying these strategies and ascertaining how well or poorly
they work will have implications for the support necessary during posttest
counseling and will help personalize the discussion of anticipated risks and
benefits of testing.  Taking a brief history of past and current psychiatric
symptoms (e.g., depression, extreme anxiety, or suicidality) will allow for an
assessment of whether this individual is at particular risk of adverse
effects after disclosure of results.  In such cases, further psychological
assessment may be indicated.
</Para><Para id="_101">In addition, cognitive deficits in the person being counseled may significantly limit
understanding of the genetic information provided and hinder the ability to
give informed consent and may also require further psychological assessment. 
Emotional responses to cancer risk may also affect overall mood and functioning
in other areas of life such as home,  work, and personal health management, including cancer screening practices.<Reference refidx="69"/>  Education and genetic counseling
sessions provide an ongoing opportunity for informal assessment of affective and cognitive aspects of the communication process.
Since behavioral factors influence adherence to screening and surveillance
recommendations, consideration of emotional barriers is important in helping a
person choose prevention strategies and in discussing the potential
utility of genetic testing.<Reference refidx="70"/><Reference refidx="71"/></Para><Para id="_102">The discussion of issues such as history of depression, anxiety, and suicidal
thoughts or tendencies requires sensitivity to the individual.  The individual
must be assured that the counseling process is a collaborative effort to
minimize intrusiveness while maximizing benefits.  Determining whether the individual is currently receiving treatment for major psychiatric illness is an important part of the counseling process.  Consultation with a mental health professional familiar
with psychological assessments may be useful to help the provider develop
the strategies for these discussions.  It also may be beneficial for the individual to
be given standard psychological self-report instruments that assess levels of
depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric difficulties that he or she may be
experiencing.  This step provides objective comparisons with already established
normative data.<Reference refidx="72"/><Reference refidx="73"/></Para><Para id="_103">In addition to the clinical assessment of psychological functioning, several instruments for cancer patients and people at increased risk of cancer
have been utilized to assess psychological
status.  These include the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression
 scale,<Reference refidx="74"/> the Profile of Mood States,<Reference refidx="75"/>  the Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale,<Reference refidx="76"/> and the Brief Symptom Inventory.<Reference refidx="77"/>  Research programs have included one or more of these
instruments as a way of helping refine the selection of people at increased
risk of adverse psychosocial consequences of genetic testing.  Psychological
assessments are an ongoing part of genetic counseling.  Some individuals
with symptoms of increased distress, extreme avoidance of affect, or other marked
psychiatric symptoms may benefit from a discussion with, or evaluation by, a mental
health professional.  It may be suggested to some people (generally, a very
small percentage of any population) that testing be postponed until greater
emotional stability has been established.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_104"><Title>Psychological Impact of Genetic Information/Test Results on the Family</Title><Para id="_105">In addition to making an assessment of the family history of cancer, the family
as a social system may also be assessed as part of the process of cancer
genetic counseling.  Hereditary susceptibility to cancer may affect social
interactions and attitudes toward the family.<Reference refidx="78"/>
</Para><Para id="_106">In assessing families, characteristics that may be relevant are the
organization of the family (including recognition of individuals who propose to
speak for or motivate other family members), patterns of communication within
the family, cohesion or closeness of family members (or lack thereof), and the
family beliefs and values that affect health behaviors.  Ethnocultural factors may
also play an important role in guiding behavior in some families.
</Para><Para id="_107">Assessment also evaluates the impact of the family’s prior experience
with illness on their attitudes and behaviors related to genetic counseling and
testing.  Prior experience with cancer diagnosis and treatment, loss due to
cancer, and the family members’ interaction with the medical community may
heavily influence attitudes toward receiving genetic information and may play a
major role in the emotional state of individuals presenting for genetic
services.
</Para><Para id="_108">The practitioner may use the above framework to guide inquiries about the
relationship of the individual to (1) the affected members of the family or (2)
others who are considering or deciding against the consideration of genetic
counseling or testing.  Inquiries about how the family shares (or does not
share) information about health, illness, and genetic susceptibility may
establish whether the individual feels under pressure from other family members
or anticipates difficulty in sharing genetic information obtained from
counseling or testing.  Inquiries about the present health (new diagnoses or
deaths from cancer) or relationship status (divorce, marriage, grieving) of
family members may inform the provider about the timing of the individual’s
participation in counseling or testing and may also reveal possible
contraindications for testing at present.
</Para><Para id="_109">In addition to using a pedigree to evaluate family health history, tools such as the genogram and ecomap can provide specific information regarding the nature of interpersonal relationships within the family and the connections with social networks outside of the family.<Reference refidx="79"/><Reference refidx="80"/><Reference refidx="81"/></Para><Para id="_1257">Evidence from a study of 297 persons from 38 Lynch syndrome–affected families suggested that the timing of genetic counseling and testing services may influence psychological test-related distress responses. Specifically, family members in the same generation as the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460155">index case</GlossaryTermRef> were more likely to experience greater test-related distress with increasingly longer lengths of time between the index case's receipt of MMR mutation results and the provision of genetic counseling and testing services to family members. However, it was unclear whether time lapses were due to a delay in the index case communicating test results or the family member choosing to delay genetic testing, despite being aware of the index case’s results.<Reference refidx="82"/></Para><Para id="_110">More specific information about family functioning in coping with hereditary

An
individual may change his or her mind about receiving results, however, until
the moment of results disclosure.  Therefore, one typically begins the
disclosure session by confirming that test results are still desired.  Some
people may decline or delay receipt of test results.  The percentage of people who will
make this decision is unknown.  Such people need ongoing follow-up and the
opportunity to receive test results in the future.
</Para><Para id="_124">Once confirmed, people appreciate direct, immediate reporting of the results;
they often describe the wait for results as one of the most stressful aspects
of undergoing testing.<Reference refidx="88"/>  Often, people need a few minutes of privacy to
gather their composure after hearing their test results.  Sometimes this
precludes all but the briefest discussion at the initial posttest visit. 
Usually, individuals who have been properly prepared through the pretest
counseling process do not exhibit disabling distress.  Although it is rare that an
acute psychological reaction will occur at disclosure, it is useful for
providers of genetic test results to establish a relationship with a mental
health provider who can be consulted should extreme reactions occur or who can be
available by referral for people seeking further exploration of emotional
issues.
</Para><Para id="_125">Either at the time of disclosure or shortly thereafter, a session for the
provider and the individual to consider the genetic, medical, psychological,
and social ramifications of the test result is advisable.  Despite having
extensive pretest education, people may still be confused about the
implications and meaning of the test results.  Examples of frequently
documented misconceptions include the belief that a positive result means that
cancer is present or certain to develop; the belief that a negative result
means that cancer will never occur; and failure to understand the uncertainty
inherent in certain test results, as when only a limited mutation panel was
examined.  Regarding medical implications, it is important to inform the person
of risk implications and management options for all of the cancer types associated with an
inherited syndrome and to revisit options for risk management. 
</Para><Para id="_126">Posttest counseling may include consideration of the implications of the test
results for other family members.  It has been suggested that some individuals affected by an inherited disorder agree to have genetic testing performed in order to acquire information that could be shared with family members. There is evidence that implementation of a follow-up counseling program with the index patient, after test results are revealed, will significantly increase the proportion of relatives informed of their genetic risk. Follow-up counseling may include telephone conversations with the index patient verifying which family members have been contacted and an offer to assist with conveying information to family members.<Reference refidx="89"/> Some experts have suggested that if a test
result is positive, plans should be made at this time for the notification, education,
and counseling of other relatives based on the test result of the individual.
Written materials, brochures, or personal letters may aid people in informing
the appropriate relatives about genetic risk.
</Para><Para id="_127">When a test result is negative, the posttest session may be briefer.  It is important, however, to discuss genetic, medical, and psychological implications of
a negative result in a family with a known mutation.  For example, it
is essential that the person understand that the general population risks for
relevant cancer types still apply and that the person’s individual risk of cancer
may still be influenced by other risk factors and family history from
the other side of the family.  Furthermore, people may be surprised to feel
distress even when a test is negative.  This outcome has been documented in the context of <GeneName>BRCA1/2</GeneName> mutation testing <Reference refidx="90"/> and may also be anticipated in other cancer
susceptibility testing.  Posttest results discussion of such distress may
lead to referral for additional counseling in some cases.
</Para><Para id="_128">Many individuals benefit from follow-up counseling and consultation with medical specialists after
disclosure of test results. This provides an opportunity for further discussion of
feelings about their risk status, options for risk management including screening and detection procedures, and implications of the test
results for other family members.

Nonetheless, a subset of mutation carriers reported that they paid for genetic testing out-of-pocket to avoid possible insurance discrimination (32%), had relatives who did not have genetic testing because of  discrimination concerns (13%), and expressed reluctance to seek new job opportunities because of  concerns about insurance coverage (13%).<Reference refidx="27"/> </Para><Para id="_1211">A 2007 survey of members of the National Society of Genetic Counselors' (NSGC) Cancer Special Interest Group found that 94% perceived the risk of genetic discrimination  to be low, very low, or theoretical.<Reference refidx="28"/>  Most reported that they felt very or somewhat confident in the ability of U.S. federal and state laws (64% and 70%, respectively) to protect against genetic discrimination for cancer predisposition testing.  Most disagreed that there are problems with health insurance as a result of having genetic testing, either for a person with (93%) or without (79%) a cancer diagnosis.  The results of this study suggest that genetic counselors, who are on the forefront or providing risk assessment and counseling for hereditary cancers, may perceive the risk of genetic discrimination to be low and believe that existing state and federal laws offer adequate protection.  Nonetheless, 35% of the NSGC sample agreed that patients may decline genetic testing for hereditary cancer risk because of concerns about health insurance discrimination.

For example, use of certain antimalaria medication in individuals with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency can result in red blood cell rupture.  Therefore, some genetic information is critical for maintaining the health and safety of military personnel, given the possible stressful occupational environments they face.

As a result of these two cases, the 8-year active duty service limit was established. This means that after 8 or more years of military service, the natural progression of a genetic condition would be deemed aggravated by military service.
