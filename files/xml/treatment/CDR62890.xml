This summary currently focuses on MEN1, MEN2, and familial PGL syndrome.  Li-Fraumeni syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, Cowden syndrome, and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome are discussed in the PDQ summaries on  <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062855" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-ovarian-genetics-pdq">Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers</SummaryRef>; <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Genetics of Colorectal Cancer</SummaryRef>; and <SummaryRef href="CDR0000574548" url="/types/kidney/hp/kidney-genetics-pdq">Genetics of Kidney Cancer</SummaryRef>.</Para><Para id="_840"> The term multiple endocrine neoplasia  is used to describe a group of heritable tumors of endocrine tissues that may be benign or malignant.  They are typically classified into two main categories:   MEN1 and MEN2.    The tumors usually manifest themselves by overproduction of hormones, tumor growth, or both.</Para><Para id="_841">Comprising varying combinations of more than 20 endocrine and nonendocrine tumors, MEN1 may be a difficult syndrome to define clinically.  In general, however, MEN1 is characterized by tumors of the parathyroids, pancreas, and pituitary gland.  This syndrome may also include carcinoid tumors, adrenocortical tumors, and nonendocrine tumors, such as facial angiofibromas, collagenomas, lipomas, meningiomas, ependymomas, and leiomyomas. </Para><Para id="_842">MEN1 syndrome, also known as Wermer syndrome, results from a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046063">mutation</GlossaryTermRef> in the <GeneName>MEN1</GeneName> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045693">gene</GlossaryTermRef>.  It has a prevalence of about 1 in 30,000 individuals.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_843">MEN2 syndromes are caused by a mutation in the <GeneName>RET</GeneName> proto-oncogene. Historically, MEN2 has been further stratified into the following three subtypes based on the presence or absence of certain endocrine tumors in the individual or family:</Para><ItemizedList id="_856" Style="bullet"><ListItem>MEN2A (<ExternalRef xref="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/171400">OMIM</ExternalRef>).</ListItem><ListItem> Familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) (<ExternalRef xref="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/155240">OMIM</ExternalRef>).</ListItem><ListItem>MEN2B (<ExternalRef xref="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/162300">OMIM</ExternalRef>).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_845">All three subtypes of MEN2 (MEN2A, FMTC, and MEN2B)  impart a high risk of developing medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). MEN2A has an increased risk of pheochromocytoma and parathyroid adenoma and/or hyperplasia. MEN2B has an increased risk of pheochromocytoma and includes additional clinical features, such as mucosal neuromas of the lips and tongue, distinctive faces with enlarged lips, ganglioneuromatosis of the gastrointestinal tract, and an asthenic Marfanoid body habitus. FMTC has been defined as the presence of at least four individuals with MTC without any other signs or symptoms of pheochromocytoma or hyperparathyroidism in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460211">proband</GlossaryTermRef> or other family members.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_846">Some families previously classified as having FMTC will go on to develop one or more of the MEN2A-related tumors, suggesting that FMTC is simply a milder variant of MEN2A.

One study of 560 individuals with MEN1 showed a significant delay between the time of the first presenting symptom and the diagnosis of MEN1.<Reference refidx="31"/> This may be because some presenting symptoms of MEN1-associated tumors, such as amenorrhea, peptic ulcers, hypoglycemia, and nephrolithiasis, are not specific to MEN1.</Para><Para id="_812">Furthermore, identification of an MEN1-associated tumor  is not sufficient to make the clinical diagnosis of MEN1 and may not trigger a referral to an endocrinologist. Other studies have shown similar findings, with median time between the first presenting symptom and diagnosis of MEN1 ranging from 7.6 years to 12 years.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="26"/> Genetic testing alleviates some of this delay. Several studies have shown statistically significant differences in the age at MEN1 diagnosis between <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460211">probands</GlossaryTermRef> and their family members. In one study, clinically symptomatic probands were diagnosed with MEN1 at a mean age of 47.5 years (standard deviation [SD] +/- 13.5 years), while family members were diagnosed at a mean age of 38.5 years (SD +/- 15.4 years; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001).<Reference refidx="31"/> In another study of 154 individuals with MEN1, probands were diagnosed at a mean age of 39.5 years (range: 18–74 years), compared with  a mean age 27 years (range: 14–56 years; <Emphasis>P &lt;</Emphasis> .05) in family members diagnosed by predictive genetic testing.<Reference refidx="32"/> These findings underscore the importance of increased awareness of the signs and symptoms of MEN1-related tumors and the constellation of findings necessary to suspect the diagnosis. It also highlights the importance of genetic counseling and testing and communication among family members once a diagnosis of MEN1 is made.

Establishing the diagnosis of MEN1 prior to making surgical decisions and referring affected individuals to a surgeon with experience in treating MEN1 can be critical in preventing unnecessary surgeries or inappropriate surgical approaches. </Para><SummarySection id="_802"><Title>Parathyroid tumors</Title><Para id="_803">Once evidence of parathyroid disease is established biochemically, the recommended course of action is surgical removal of the parathyroid glands. The timing and the extent of surgery, however, remain controversial.<Reference refidx="58"/> Some groups reserve surgical intervention for symptomatic patients, with continued annual biochemical screening for those who are asymptomatic. Once surgery is necessary, subtotal parathyroidectomy (removal of 3–3.5 glands) is often suggested as the initial treatment. However, the rate of recurrence is quite high (55%–66%), and reoperation is often necessary.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/> Another study has shown that bilateral thymectomy reduces the likelihood of recurrence.<Reference refidx="59"/> Total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue to the forearm is also an option.  A benefit of this approach is the easier removal of recurrent disease from the forearm than from the neck. Although the likelihood of recurrence is lowered by more extensive surgery, this must be weighed against the risk of rendering the patient hypoparathyroid.<Reference refidx="59"/> Management of persistent hypoparathyroidism with oral calcitriol is necessary.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_804"><Title>Duodenopancreatic NETs</Title><Para id="_882">The role of surgery for pancreatic NETs in MEN1 is controversial, given postoperative morbidity, long-term complications, and low cure rates. The timing and extent of surgery depend on many factors, including severity of symptoms, extent of disease, type and location of tumor, risk of metastasis, and patient preference. The primary goal of surgery is to improve long-term survival by reducing symptoms associated with hormone excess and lowering the risk of distant metastasis.<Reference refidx="17"/>  While more extensive surgical approaches (e.g., pancreatoduodenectomy) have been associated with higher cure rates and improved overall survival,<Reference refidx="60"/><Reference refidx="61"/><Reference refidx="62"/> they also have higher rates of postoperative complications and long-term morbidity.<Reference refidx="63"/> Therefore, the risks and benefits should be carefully considered, and surgical decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis.</Para><Para id="_883">Individuals with MEN1 who are diagnosed with NETs often have multiple tumors of various types throughout the pancreas and duodenum, some of which can be identified using magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography. Many tumors, however, are too small to be detected using standard imaging techniques, and intra-arterial secretin stimulation testing and/or intraoperative ultrasound may be useful.<Reference refidx="64"/><Reference refidx="65"/> Preoperative assessment using various biochemical and imaging modalities, intraoperative assessment of tumor burden, and resolution of hormonal hyper-secretion are critical and, in some series, have been associated with higher cure rates and longer disease-free intervals.<Reference refidx="64"/><Reference refidx="65"/><Reference refidx="66"/></Para><Para id="_948">In the current era of effective treatment for hyperfunctional hormone excess states, most MEN1-related deaths are due to the malignant nature of pancreatic NETs. A less common but important risk of death  is from malignant thymic carcinoid tumors.   Indicators of a poor MEN1 prognosis include elevated fasting serum gastrin, the presence of functional hormonal syndromes,  liver or distant metastases, aggressive  pancreatic NET growth,  large  pancreatic NET size,  or the need for multiple parathyroidectomies.   The most common cause of non-MEN1–related death in this patient cohort is from cardiovascular disease.<Reference refidx="67"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_878"><Title>Insulinomas</Title><Para id="_879">Medical management of insulinoma using diet and medication is often unsuccessful; the mainstay of treatment for this tumor is surgery.<Reference refidx="37"/> Insulinomas in MEN1 patients can be located throughout the pancreas, with a preponderance found in the distal gland,<Reference refidx="68"/><Reference refidx="69"/><Reference refidx="70"/> and have a higher rate of metastasis than sporadic insulinoma.<Reference refidx="71"/> Surgery can range from enucleation of single or multiple large tumors to partial pancreatic resection, or both,<Reference refidx="69"/>  to subtotal or total pancreatectomy.<Reference refidx="68"/><Reference refidx="69"/> More extensive surgical approaches are associated with a lower rate of recurrence <Reference refidx="60"/><Reference refidx="61"/><Reference refidx="69"/> but a higher rate of postoperative morbidity. Because insulinoma often occurs in conjunction with nonfunctioning pancreatic tumors, the selective intra-arterial calcium-injection test (SAS test) may be necessary to determine the source of insulin excess.<Reference refidx="72"/> Intraoperative monitoring of insulin/glucose can help determine whether insulin-secreting tumors have been successfully excised.<Reference refidx="65"/><Reference refidx="73"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_880"><Title>Gastrinomas</Title><Para id="_881">The majority of MEN1-associated gastrinomas originate in the duodenum. These tumors are typically multifocal and cause hyper-secretion of gastrin, with resultant peptic ulcer disease (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). The multifocal nature makes complete surgical resection difficult. It is critical to manage symptoms prior to considering any type of surgical intervention. Historically, some groups have recommended close observation of individuals with smaller tumors (&lt;2.0 cm on imaging) who have relief of symptoms using medications (e.g., proton pump inhibitors or histamine-2 agonists);<Reference refidx="74"/> however, this approach may not be optimal for all patients.</Para><Para id="_884">Several published series have shown a positive correlation between primary tumor size and rate of distant metastasis. One retrospective study showed that 61% of patients with tumors larger than 3 cm had liver metastases.<Reference refidx="17"/> In another series, 40% of patients with tumors larger than 3 cm had liver metastases.<Reference refidx="75"/> In contrast, both of these series showed significantly lower rates of liver metastases in individuals with tumors smaller than 3 cm (32% and 4.8%, respectively). On the basis of these and other data, many groups recommend surgery in individuals with nonmetastatic gastrinoma who have tumors larger than 2 cm.<Reference refidx="37"/><Reference refidx="62"/></Para><Para id="_885">The type of surgery for gastrinoma depends on many factors. A Whipple procedure is typically discouraged as an initial surgery, given the high postoperative morbidity and long-term complications, such as diabetes mellitus and malabsorption. Less extensive surgeries have been described with varying results. At a minimum, duodenectomy with intraoperative palpation and/or ultrasound to locate and excise duodenal tumors and peri-pancreatic lymph node dissection are  performed.<Reference refidx="64"/><Reference refidx="76"/> Because most patients with gastrinoma will have concomitant NETs throughout the pancreas, some of which may be nonfunctional, some groups recommend resection of the distal pancreas and enucleation of tumors in the pancreatic head in addition to duodenal tumor excision.<Reference refidx="64"/><Reference refidx="76"/><Reference refidx="77"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_886"><Title>Nonfunctioning NETs</Title><Para id="_887">Approximately 50% of individuals with MEN1 will develop nonfunctioning NETs.<Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="22"/> These are often identified incidentally during assessment and exploration for functioning tumors.  As with gastrinomas, the metastatic rate is correlated with larger tumor size;<Reference refidx="22"/> the presence of metastatic disease has been associated with earlier age at death than in those  without pancreatic NETs.<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="78"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_888"><Title>Other pancreatic NETs</Title><Para id="_889">Glucagonomas, VIPomas, and somatostatinomas are rare but often have higher rates of malignancy than other pancreatic NETs.<Reference refidx="79"/> These are often treated with aggressive surgery.<Reference refidx="71"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_890"><Title>Pituitary tumors</Title><Para id="_891">Medical therapy to suppress hypersecretion is often the first line of therapy for MEN1-associated pituitary tumors. In one series of 136 patients, medical therapy was successful in approximately one-half of patients with secreting tumors (49 of 116, 42%), and successful suppression was correlated with smaller tumor size.<Reference refidx="80"/> Surgery is often necessary for patients who are resistant to this treatment. Radiation therapy is reserved for patients with incomplete surgical resection.<Reference refidx="37"/><Reference refidx="81"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="11443853">Chandrasekharappa SC, Teh BT: Clinical and molecular aspects of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.

MEN2-associated MTC is often bilateral and/or multifocal and arises in the background of CCH. In contrast, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339347">sporadic</GlossaryTermRef> MTC is typically unilateral and/or unifocal.

parathyroid, paratracheal, jugular chain, and upper mediastinum) or to distant
sites, such as the liver, is common in patients who
present with a palpable thyroid mass or diarrhea.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>  Although
pheochromocytomas rarely metastasize, they can be clinically significant in cases of intractable
hypertension or anesthesia-induced hypertensive crises.  Parathyroid
abnormalities in MEN2 can range from benign parathyroid adenomas or multigland hyperplasia to clinically evident
hyperparathyroidism with hypercalcemia and renal stones.

Age at onset can vary widely, even within families. Medullary thyroid cancer can present with earlier onset and more aggressive disease in successive generations, depending on the genotype. MEN2A families may exhibit some or all of these features. As an autosomal dominant syndrome, transmission can occur through maternal or paternal lineages.</Caption></MediaLink><Para id="_989">In a child, the presence of oral and ocular neuromas and/or a tall and lanky appearance may warrant further investigation.<Reference refidx="77"/> Some authors have recommended referral to genetic counseling for an individual with medullary thyroid cancer or any of the following features:<Reference refidx="77"/><Reference refidx="78"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_990" Style="bullet">

occur in about 50% of MEN2B cases; about half are multiple and often bilateral.
Clinically apparent parathyroid disease is very uncommon.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="63"/><Reference refidx="86"/> Patients with MEN2B may be identified in infancy or early childhood by a
distinctive facial appearance and the presence of mucosal neuromas on the
anterior dorsal surface of the tongue, palate, or pharynx.  The lips become
prominent over time, and submucosal nodules may be present on the vermilion
border of the lips.  Neuromas of the eyelids may cause thickening and eversion
of the upper eyelid margins.  Prominent thickened corneal nerves may be seen by
slit lamp examination.

preventive option for all subtypes of MEN2.  To implement this
management strategy, biochemical screening to identify CCH and/or genetic testing
to identify persons who carry causative <GeneName>RET</GeneName> mutations is needed to identify
candidates for risk-reducing surgery (see below).  The optimal timing of
surgery, however, is controversial.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Current recommendations are based on
clinical experience and vary for different MEN2 subtypes, as noted in <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062890#_748" url="/types/thyroid/hp/medullary-thyroid-genetics-pdq">Table 5</SummaryRef>.</Para><Para id="_750">In contrast, a prospective analysis of 84 carriers of the <GeneName>RET</GeneName> gene mutation found that basal and pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin levels could be used to determine the timing of total thyroidectomy.<Reference refidx="109"/>  When the basal or stimulated calcitonin was greater than 10 pg/mL, total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection were strongly recommended.  In this series, a basal calcitonin level lower than 60 pg/mL was always associated with an intrathyroidal MTC; none of the 56 patients who went to surgery had metastatic involvement.  These findings suggest that surgery can be safely delayed in gene carriers of a <GeneName>RET</GeneName> mutation until basal or stimulated calcitonin is above 10 pg/mL, while still maintaining the ability to achieve a disease-free state (i.e., an undetectable basal and stimulated calcitonin 6–12 months after surgery).  The benefits of this approach are particularly noteworthy in the younger population of gene carriers, as a delay in surgery until the patient is older may reduce the risk of surgical complications. While this approach is promising, pentagastrin is currently not available in the United States for stimulation testing. Although calcium may be used as a substitute for pentagastrin, it has not been widely validated.</Para><Para id="_971">One series of 503 at-risk individuals with ATA level A or B mutations (i.e. codons 533, 609, 611, 618, 620, 791, and 804) reported cumulative penetrance rates, median time to MTC, and predictive value of preoperative calcitonin.<Reference refidx="110"/> The risk of developing MTC by age 50 years ranged from 18% to 95%, depending on the codon, with codon 620 having the highest penetrance. Most patients with MTC had node-negative disease, confirming the more indolent disease course that has been previously reported with these mutations. Although an elevated preoperative calcitonin level strongly predicted presence of MTC, relatively high false-negative rates (low normal calcitonin levels with MTC) were noted for many of the codons. This information is useful when counseling mutation carriers regarding surgical decisions.</Para><Para id="_952">Another study has confirmed that calcitonin levels could be a useful approach to determine the timing of thyroidectomy.<Reference refidx="198"/> This study utilized preoperative basal calcitonin levels and ultrasound findings to determine timing of prophylactic thyroidectomy in 24 <GeneName>RET</GeneName> mutation carriers, many of whom carried mutations in the highest risk level and had delayed surgery until after age 20 years. All 17 individuals who underwent surgery had elevated preoperative calcitonin levels on the fully-automated chemiluminescence immunoassay. Fifteen of 17 individuals had MTC, but only two had lymph node involvement and/or local tissue invasion, and 16 of 17 were disease free at 22 months. Two patients had CCH. Of note, only 6 of 15 individuals with MTC had elevated calcitonin levels using the radioimmunoassay. The study is limited by a small population of patients with low disease burden but suggests that some calcitonin assays may be more sensitive than others.</Para><Table id="_748"><Title>Table 5.

The use of biochemical screening is limited, however, by the lack of data on age-specific calcitonin levels in children  younger than 3 years; caution should be used when interpreting these values in this age group.<Reference refidx="25"/></Para><Para id="_715">A study of 93 patients with MEN2 from a Dutch tumor registry documented the importance of early prophylactic thyroidectomy.<Reference refidx="199"/> This group of patients represented all known Dutch patients with hereditary MTC; the majority of cases (67%) were codon 634 mutations; only 6% were MEN2B cases. Patients in this series were screened with either biochemical testing (pre-<GeneName>RET</GeneName> era) or <GeneName>RET</GeneName> mutation analysis. In both groups, patients underwent surgery at a later age than recommended by current guidelines (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062890#_748" url="/types/thyroid/hp/medullary-thyroid-genetics-pdq">Table 5</SummaryRef>), but the percentage from the pre-<GeneName>RET</GeneName> era was significantly higher (96% vs. 69%, <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .004).  Older age at prophylactic thyroidectomy was significantly associated with a higher risk of postoperative persistent/recurrent disease.  Although there is concern that young age at total thyroidectomy is associated with higher risk of surgical complications, this study found no such evidence.</Para><Para id="_76">Two additional case series provide further data supporting early risk-reducing thyroidectomy
following testing for <GeneName>RET</GeneName>  mutations.<Reference refidx="200"/><Reference refidx="201"/>  Cases reported in both series
could reflect selection biases: one study reported 71 patients from a national
registry who had been treated with thyroidectomy but did not specify how these
patients were selected, whereas the other study reported 21 patients seen at a
referral center.<Reference refidx="200"/><Reference refidx="201"/>  In both studies, a series of children from families with MEN2
or FMTC who were found to have <GeneName>RET</GeneName> mutations were screened for CCH and treated with risk-reducing thyroidectomy.  These studies
documented MTC in 93% of patients with MEN2 and 77% of patients with FMTC.  The larger study found
a correlation between age and larger tumor size, nodal metastases,
postoperative recurrence of disease, and mean basal calcitonin levels. 
Surgical complications were rare.<Reference refidx="200"/>  No studies have compared the outcome of
thyroidectomy based on mutation testing with thyroidectomy based on
biochemical screening.</Para><Para id="_163">In one large series, 260 MEN2A subjects aged 0 to 20 years were identified as having undergone either an early total thyroidectomy (ages 1–5 years, n = 42), or late thyroidectomy (ages 6–20 years, n = 218).<Reference refidx="202"/>  There was a significantly lower rate of invasive or metastatic MTC among those who underwent surgery at an early age (57%) than among those who underwent surgery at a late age (76%).  Follow-up information was available on only 28% of the cohort, as a result of the limitations of study design, with a median follow-up of only 2 years for this nonsystematically selected subgroup.  Persistent or recurrent disease was reported among 0 of 9 early-surgery subjects, versus 21 of 65 late-surgery subjects.  Both findings are consistent with the hypothesis that patients undergoing surgery before age 6 years have a more favorable outcome, but the nature of the data prevents this from being a definitive conclusion.  Finally, there was evidence to suggest that subjects carrying codon 634 mutations were much more likely to present with invasive or metastatic MTC and to develop persistent or recurrent disease compared with those harboring mutations in codons 804, 618, or 620.</Para><Para id="_245">A study of young, clinically asymptomatic individuals with MEN2A sought to determine if early thyroidectomy could prevent or cure MTC.<Reference refidx="203"/>  This study included 50 consecutively identified <GeneName>RET</GeneName> mutation carriers who underwent  thyroidectomy at 19 years or younger. Preoperative screening for CCH included basal and stimulated calcitonin levels and postoperative follow-up consisted of annual physical exam and intermittent basal and stimulated calcitonin measurements. All 50 individuals had at least 5 years of follow-up. Although MTC was identified in 33 of 50 patients at the time of surgery, in 44 of 50 (88%) there was no evidence of persistent or recurrent disease at a mean of 7 years follow-up. Six patients had basal or stimulated calcitonin abnormalities thought to represent residual MTC. None of the 22 patients operated on prior to age 8 years had any evidence of MTC. The data suggested that there was a lower incidence of persistent or recurrent disease in patients who had thyroidectomy earlier in life (defined as younger than 8 years) and who had no evidence of lymph node metastases.</Para><Para id="_77">Normal preoperative basal calcitonin does not exclude the possibility of the patient having MTC.  In one study of 80 <GeneName>RET</GeneName> mutation carriers, 14 carriers had normal calcitonin tests and eight of these patients had small foci of MTC discovered at thyroidectomy.<Reference refidx="13"/> Another study confirmed these findings,<Reference refidx="84"/> as 14 children had total thyroidectomy based on positive genetic testing for MEN2; MTC was present in 11 and only four had elevated stimulated calcitonin levels prior to surgery. Although basal calcitonin levels may not be able to identify all patients with MTC preoperatively, this test has utility as a predictor of postoperative remission, lymph node metastases, and distant metastases.<Reference refidx="204"/>    In one study of 224 patients from a single institution, preoperative basal calcitonin levels greater than 500 pg/mL predicted failure to achieve biochemical remission.<Reference refidx="204"/>  The authors of this study found that nodal metastases started appearing at basal calcitonin levels of 40 pg/mL (normal, &lt;10 pg/mL).  In node-positive patients, distant metastases emerged at basal calcitonin levels of 150 pg/mL to 400 pg/mL.  Using current sensitive calcitonin assays, a study of 308 <GeneName>RET </GeneName> carriers found that a normal basal preoperative calcitonin excluded the presence of lymph node metastases (100% negative predictive value).<Reference refidx="205"/> Therefore, the preoperative basal calcitonin level is a useful prognostic indicator and may help guide the surgical approach.</Para><Para id="_717">While thyroidectomy prior to biochemical evidence of disease (normal preoperative calcitonin) may reduce the risk of recurrent disease, continued monitoring for residual or recurrent MTC is still recommended.<Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="206"/> One study found that 10% of patients with MEN2A undergoing thyroidectomy developed recurrent disease, based on an initially undetectable basal and stimulated calcitonin levels (&lt;2 pg/mL) that became positive 5 to 10 years after surgery.<Reference refidx="203"/>  Only 2% of patients had residual disease after prophylactic surgery as assessed by a persistently elevated basal or stimulated calcitonin.<Reference refidx="203"/></Para><Para id="_78">Questions remain concerning the natural history of MEN2.  As more information
is acquired, recommendations regarding the optimal age for thyroidectomy and
the potential role for genetics and biochemical screening may change.  For
example, a case report documents MTC before age 5 years in two siblings with MEN2A.<Reference refidx="207"/> 
Conversely, another case report documents onset of cancer in midlife or later
in some families with FMTC and in elderly relatives who carry the FMTC
genotype but have not developed cancer.<Reference refidx="208"/>  The possibility that certain mutations (e.g., Cys634) might convey a significantly worse prognosis, if confirmed, may permit tailoring intervention based on knowing the specific <GeneName>RET</GeneName> mutation.<Reference refidx="202"/> These clinical observations
suggest that the natural history of the MEN2 syndromes is variable and could be
subject to modifying effects related to specific <GeneName>RET</GeneName> mutations, other genes,
behavioral factors, or environmental exposures.

The dosing of medication is age-dependent and treatment should be initiated based on ideal body weight.  For healthy adults 60 years and younger with no cardiac disease, a reasonable starting dose is 1.6 to 1.8 µg/kg given once daily.<Reference refidx="215"/>  Older patients may require 20% to 30% less thyroid hormone.<Reference refidx="216"/>  Children clear T4 more rapidly than adults and consequently require relatively higher replacement by body weight.  Depending on the age of the child, replacement should be between 2 to 6 µg/kg.<Reference refidx="217"/>  It is important to note, however, that patients should be given replacement, rather than suppressive therapy.  Since C-cell tumors are not thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-dependent for growth, the T4 therapy for MTC patients therefore should be adjusted to maintain a TSH within the normal reference range.  Thyroglobulin measurement may also be useful for adjusting and maintaining TSH levels within a normal reference range to prevent additional regrowth of remnant thyroid tissue.<Reference refidx="218"/> Further investigation is needed to better interpret how this information should guide management.</Para><Para id="_718">There is no difference in survival between familial and sporadic forms of MTC when adjusted for clinicopathologic factors.

Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the recommended approach by some authorities for the treatment of unilateral pheochromocytoma.<Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="25"/> Two studies examined the value of a posterior retroperitoneoscopic adrenalectomy and found that it was safe and effective, with zero mortality, associated with a low rate of minor complications, and required conversion to open or laparoscopic lateral surgery in only  1.7%.<Reference refidx="228"/><Reference refidx="229"/>  This approach appears to be a feasible and safe alternative to open or laparoscopic surgery, but extensive experience is needed.</Para><Para id="_145">In one series, 23 patients with a unilateral pheochromocytoma and a macroscopically normal contralateral adrenal gland were treated initially with unilateral adrenalectomy.<Reference refidx="230"/>   A pheochromocytoma developed within the retained gland in 12 (52%) of these subjects, occurring a mean of 11.9 years after initial surgery.  During follow-up subsequent to unilateral adrenalectomy, no patient experienced a hypertensive crisis or other problems attributable to an undiagnosed pheochromocytoma.  In contrast, 10 of 43 patients (23%) treated with bilateral adrenalectomy experienced at least one episode of acute adrenal insufficiency; one of these patients died.  Unilateral adrenalectomy appears to represent a reasonable management strategy for unilateral pheochromocytoma in patients with MEN2,<Reference refidx="231"/><Reference refidx="232"/><Reference refidx="233"/> when coupled with periodic surveillance (serum or urinary catecholamine measurements) for the development of disease in the contralateral adrenal gland.</Para><Para id="_938">Synchronous or metachronous bilateral disease is quite common in hereditary pheochromocytoma.  In one retrospective series that spanned almost 50 years, 96 patients underwent surgical resection for hereditary pheochromocytoma.<Reference refidx="234"/> Forty-seven patients had bilateral pheochromocytoma and 49 had unilateral pheochromocytoma at presentation. Open and laparoscopic approaches were used, and the extent of initial resection varied. Of the 49 patients who presented with a unilateral pheochromocytoma and who underwent unilateral total adrenalectomy, 15 (30%) developed pheochromocytoma in the contralateral gland. This occurred at a median of 8.2 years (range, 1 to 20 years) after initial diagnosis. Of the 15 patients who developed pheochromocytoma in the contralateral gland, 8 had MEN2A, 2 had MEN2B, 2 had VHL, and 1 had familial pheochromocytoma. The risk of contralateral tumor development increased over time, with 25% of patients developing tumors after a median of 6 years and 43% after a median of 32 years.</Para><Para id="_939">This study also analyzed whether cortical-sparing adrenalectomy is a feasible option for patients with bilateral pheochromocytomas or  only one viable adrenal gland.<Reference refidx="234"/>  Cortical-sparing surgery is an attractive option because it minimizes the risk of adrenal insufficiency and the need for lifelong steroid supplementation. In this same series of 96 patients, 50 underwent cortical-sparing surgery. Twenty-eight of the cortical-sparing surgeries were part of an initial bilateral procedure, 11 were for unilateral disease, and 11 were part of a subsequent procedure on the contralateral gland. There was a 7% recurrence rate after cortical-sparing surgery versus a 3% recurrence rate after total resection (recurrence in the adrenal bed). Interestingly, the rate of recurrence was significantly higher in patients who underwent a laparoscopic procedure (14%) than in  patients who underwent an open procedure (6%). The rate of recurrence was also significantly higher in patients  who underwent  a laparoscopic total adrenalectomy versus an open procedure. The frequency of adrenal insufficiency was lower in patients who underwent cortical-sparing surgery. One of 39 patients (3%) developed adrenal insufficiency after a cortical-sparing procedure; 5 of 25 patients (20%) developed adrenal insufficiency after total adrenalectomy.  In summary, cortical-sparing surgery is a viable option for patients with hereditary pheochromocytoma, but ongoing surveillance for new or recurrent disease is necessary, especially in patients who undergo a laparoscopic procedure.</Para><Para id="_137"><LOERef href="CDR0000531845">Level of evidence: 4</LOERef></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_139"><Title>Treatment for those with hyperparathyroidism</Title><Para id="_140">Most patients with MEN2-related parathyroid disease are either asymptomatic or diagnosed incidentally at the time of thyroidectomy.  Typically, the hypercalcemia (when present) is mild, although it may be associated with increased urinary excretion of calcium and nephrolithiasis.  As a consequence, the indications for surgical intervention are generally similar to those recommended for patients with sporadic, primary hyperparathyroidism.<Reference refidx="23"/> In general, fewer than four of the parathyroid glands are involved at the time of detected abnormalities in calcium metabolism.  </Para><Para id="_141">Cure of hyperparathyroidism was achieved surgically in 89% of one large series of patients;<Reference refidx="71"/> however, 22% of resected patients in this study developed postoperative hypoparathyroidism. Five patients (9%) had recurrent hyperparathyroidism.  This series employed various surgical techniques, including total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation to the nondominant forearm, subtotal parathyroidectomy, and resection only of glands that were macroscopically enlarged. Postoperative hypoparathyroidism developed in 4 of 11  patients (36%), 6 of 12  patients (50%),  and 3 of 29  patients (10%), respectively.

For patients with MEN2B in whom the risk of parathyroid disease is quite low, the parathyroid glands may be left in the neck.

Extra-adrenal neoplasms, referred to as PGLs, may arise in various sites from the glomera along the parasympathetic nerves or the paraganglia in the sympathetic trunk.  PGLs may be found in the head and neck region, abdomen, or pelvis.  PGLs found in the skull base or head and neck region are usually from parasympathetic paraganglia and rarely secrete catecholamines. Representing 3% of all PGLs,<Reference refidx="2"/> the tumors in the cervical region typically arise in the glomus cells, near the aortic body, along the vagal nerve, in the temporal bone, in the jugular fossa (middle ear space), or in the nose and parasinus.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Tumors below the neck are most commonly located in the upper mediastinum, adrenal medulla (pheochromocytoma), or the urinary bladder.<Reference refidx="3"/>  The reported incidence of these tumors in the general population is variable because they may be asymptomatic but ranges from 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 100,000 individuals.<Reference refidx="3"/> One autopsy study found a much greater incidence of 1 in 2,000 individuals, suggesting a high frequency of occult tumors.<Reference refidx="4"/>  These tumors have an equal sex distribution.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>  PGLs can occur at any age but have the highest incidence between the ages of 40 and 50 years.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_852"><Title>Clinical Description</Title><Para id="_871">PGLs may occur sporadically, as a manifestation of a hereditary syndrome, or as the sole tumor in one of several hereditary PGL/pheochromocytoma syndromes.

Conversely, a minority of these tumors may be malignant and present with a more aggressive clinical course.

Some experts view local invasion into surrounding tissue as an additional marker of malignancy.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/>  Others have disagreed with this classification because locally invasive tumors tend to follow a more indolent course than tumors with distant metastatic involvement.<Reference refidx="11"/> There are no reliable molecular, immunohistochemical, or genetic predictors to  distinguish benign and malignant tumors,<Reference refidx="12"/> although some studies have shown a higher rate in <GeneName>SDHB</GeneName> carriers <Reference refidx="13"/> and in  individuals with larger tumors.<Reference refidx="14"/> Consequently, estimation of the rate of malignancy in PGLs is difficult; rates from 5% to 20% have been reported.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/>  Common sites of metastases include bone, liver, and lungs.<Reference refidx="1"/> </Para><Para id="_873">PGLs arise from cells involved in the metabolism of catecholamines, but approximately 95% of tumors located in the head and neck region are parasympathetic and nonsecretory.<Reference refidx="10"/>  Only  tumors arising from the sympathetic neural chain have secretory capacity.  The most recognizable PGL of the head and neck is the tumor arising from the carotid body.  These tumors (glomus caroticum) present a significant challenge for surgeons because of their proximity to critical vessels and cranial nerves.  The presence of the neoplasm in this critical location frequently results in the compromise of nearby structures; removal of the tumor may cause permanent impairment.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_877"><Title>Clinical Diagnosis of PGL</Title><Para id="_874">A PGL may cause a variety of symptoms depending on the location of the tumor and whether the tumor has secretory capacity.  PGLs of the head and neck are rarely associated with elevated catecholamines.  Secretory  PGLs may cause hypertension, headache, tachycardia, sweating, and flushing.    Typically, nonsecretory tumors are painless, coming to attention only when growth of the lesion into surrounding structures causes a mass effect.  Patients with a head or neck PGL may present with an enlarging lateral neck mass, hoarseness, Horner syndrome, pulsatile tinnitus, dizziness, facial droop, or blurred vision.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_875">Imaging is the mainstay of diagnosis; the initial evaluation includes computed tomography of the neck and chest.  PGLs typically appear homogeneous with intense enhancement after administration of intravenous contrast.  Magnetic resonance imaging may also be used to distinguish the tumor from adjacent vascular and skeletal structures.  On T2-weighted images, a tumor that is larger than 2 cm is likely to display a classic "salt and pepper" appearance, a reflection of scattered areas of signal void mingled with areas of high signal intensity from increased vascularity.<Reference refidx="17"/> </Para><Para id="_876">Nuclear imaging in combination with anatomic imaging may be useful for localization and determination of the extent of disease (multifocality vs. distant metastatic deposits).  Functional imaging with 18F-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-DOPA), 18F-fluorodopamine, or positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) may be particularly helpful in localizing head and neck tumors.  Additionally, 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine plus PET-CT is very specific for PGLs.

FPGL is most commonly caused by mutations in one of the following four genes: <GeneName>SDHA</GeneName>, <GeneName>SDHB</GeneName>, <GeneName>SDHC</GeneName>, and <GeneName>SDHD</GeneName> (collectively referred to as <GeneName>SDHx</GeneName>). The SDHx proteins form part of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, which is located on the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a critical role in cellular energy metabolism.<Reference refidx="23"/>  Mutations in <GeneName>SDHB</GeneName> are most common, followed by <GeneName>SDHD</GeneName> and rarely <GeneName>SDHC</GeneName> and <GeneName>SDHA</GeneName>. More recently, mutations in the <GeneName>SDHAF2</GeneName> (also called <GeneName>SDH5</GeneName>), <GeneName>TMEM127</GeneName>, and <GeneName>MAX</GeneName> genes have been described in FPGL, but these mutations are rare. The mechanism of tumor formation has remained elusive. One study suggests that <GeneName>SDHx</GeneName>-associated tumors display a hypermethylator <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460203">phenotype</GlossaryTermRef> that is associated with downregulation of important genes involved in the differentiation of neuroendocrine tissues.<Reference refidx="24"/></Para><Para id="_920">The inheritance pattern of FPGL depends on the gene involved. While most families show traditional <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339338">autosomal dominant</GlossaryTermRef> inheritance, those with mutations in <GeneName>SDHAF2</GeneName> and <GeneName>SDHD</GeneName> show almost exclusive paternal transmission of the phenotype. In other words, while the mutation can be passed down from mother or father, tumors will develop only if the mutation is inherited from the father.<Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/> In cases of FPGL not caused by <GeneName>SDHD</GeneName> or <GeneName>SDHAF2</GeneName> mutations, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460150">first-degree relatives</GlossaryTermRef> of an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460124">affected</GlossaryTermRef> individual have a 50% chance of carrying the mutation and are at increased risk of developing PGLs. Because the family history can appear negative in families with lower <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339344">penetrance</GlossaryTermRef> mutations, it is important to offer genetic testing to all <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460224">unaffected</GlossaryTermRef> first-degree relatives once the mutation in the family has been identified.</Para><Para id="_921">Genetic testing for hereditary pheochromocytoma and PGL syndromes is largely based on published algorithms,<Reference refidx="27"/> whereby testing is performed stepwise based on factors such as tumor type and location, age at diagnosis, family history, and presence of malignancy.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/> This approach has allowed for cost-effective, targeted testing based on clinical features. Within the last several years, however, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000763024">next-generation sequencing</GlossaryTermRef> (NGS) technology has led to a dramatic decrease in the cost of genetic testing, and it is now possible to test for mutations in 10 to 30 genes for the same cost of testing two or three genes. These tests may be more appropriate for individuals and families who have an atypical presentation or overlapping clinical features. If the cost associated with multigene testing panels continues to decrease, it is likely that the testing algorithms may soon be obsolete for PGL and pheochromocytoma. A recent series analyzed 85 PGL and pheochromocytoma samples using an NGS panel test for the ten  known PGL <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460209">susceptibility genes</GlossaryTermRef> and showed a sensitivity of 98.7%.<Reference refidx="30"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_854"><Title>Genotype-Phenotype Correlations</Title><Para id="_922">In FPGL, the type and location of tumors, age at onset, and lifetime penetrance vary depending on the gene that is mutated.

The alpha-adrenoreceptor blocker phenoxybenzamine (Dibenzyline) is most frequently used  to control blood pressure and expand the blood volume.<Reference refidx="48"/> Other alpha-blocking drugs have also been used with success, including prazosin, terazosin, or doxazosin; these drugs are more specific alpha-1 adrenergic competitive antagonists and have a shorter half-life than phenoxybenzamine.<Reference refidx="52"/><Reference refidx="53"/> The noncompetitive binding of phenoxybenzamine to the alpha receptors, coupled with its longer half-life, may result in a sustained effect of the drug, with some patients experiencing postoperative hypotension.<Reference refidx="48"/><Reference refidx="54"/>  One study found that patients treated with sustained-release doxazosin had more stable perioperative hemodynamic changes and a shorter time interval to preoperative blood pressure control than did patients who received phenoxybenzamine.<Reference refidx="54"/></Para><Para id="_935">Once the alpha blockade is initiated, expansion of the blood volume is often necessary, as these patients are typically volume contracted.<Reference refidx="55"/><Reference refidx="56"/>  In addition to the vasodilatory effects from alpha blockade, volume expansion may be achieved by consuming a high-sodium diet and high fluid intake or a preoperative saline infusion.   A clinical manifestation of adequate blockade is the symptom of nasal stuffiness or lightheadedness. </Para><Para id="_936">If heart-rate control is needed, a beta blocker may be used in conjunction with the alpha blocker 2 to 3 days before surgery.  Beta blockers are not generally used alone, as unopposed alpha stimulation can result in exacerbation of hypertension.  It is also important to note that some patients may have undiagnosed cardiac insufficiency from the chronic stimulation by catecholamines; expansion of the blood volume and use of beta blockers may precipitate acute heart failure.</Para><Para id="_937">Calcium channel blockers such as nicardipine or nifedipine also have been employed to control the hypertension preoperatively.<Reference refidx="57"/>  A calcium channel blocker may be used in conjunction with alpha and beta blockade for refractory hypertension or used alone as a second-line agent for patients with intolerable side effects from alpha blockade.<Reference refidx="48"/>   </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_940"><Title>Surgical interventions</Title><Para id="_941">Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for PGLs.  After appropriate preoperative pharmacologic preparation (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062890#_931" url="/types/thyroid/hp/medullary-thyroid-genetics-pdq">above</SummaryRef>), a successful resection involves several key elements. A thorough medical history and physical exam includes obtaining information about the patient's autonomic nervous system,  including the presence of tachyarrhythmias or elevated blood pressure.  Inappropriate preoperative preparation, induction of anesthesia, tumor manipulation, or other stimulation can result in massive intraoperative outpouring of catecholamines with subsequent hypertensive crisis and possible stroke, arrhythmia, or myocardial infarction.<Reference refidx="58"/></Para><Para id="_942">Accurate preoperative imaging identifies vascularity and enables assessment of peritumoral invasion. <Emphasis>En bloc</Emphasis> resection with possible vascular reconstruction may be part of the preoperative plan.  The arterial supply frequently includes small tributaries from the aorta, renal artery, and the inferior phrenic artery or iliac arteries. The arterial supply  should be studied preoperatively to inform the surgical planning strategy. This is particularly critical because unexpected intraoperative vascular findings can be life threatening.</Para><Para id="_960">Central line access is critical so that intravenous fluids and medications can be rapidly administered. Communication between the operating surgeon and the anesthesiologist is necessary during the procedure. Before the tumor is removed, blood pressure is controlled with vasodilators, nitroprusside, and/or calcium channel blockers. Upon ligation of the vessels, pressor support may be required.  </Para><Para id="_943">Adequate exposure of the tumor is important.  PGLs are commonly located in the para-aortic retroperitoneal sympathetic chain above the aortic bifurcation, below the takeoff of the inferior mesenteric artery (organ of Zuckerkandl), or near the dome of the bladder.<Reference refidx="58"/><Reference refidx="59"/>  Means of exposure using the transperitoneal approach are based on the anatomic location of the tumor.  Proximal and distal control of blood vessels is critical.  Vascular reconstruction can be considered in selected patients with local, large-vessel invasion, if such reconstruction will result in complete tumor extirpation. Dissection around the tumor without capsular rupture or tumor manipulation is important.  Ideally, the adrenal vein is ligated early in the dissection to prevent release of catecholamines if the tumor is manipulated. However, this may not be possible in the case of a large tumor. When direct visualization of the tumor is apparent, clear differentiation between the surrounding tissue planes is necessary.   Commonly, malignant PGLs have a dense fibrous capsule that is adherent to surrounding vascularity, which can make a complete resection difficult.<Reference refidx="58"/>  Regional lymph nodes are commonly involved with the tumor, and if suspected preoperatively or noted intraoperatively, a regional lymphadenectomy should be performed.  <Emphasis>En bloc</Emphasis> resection of surrounding organs is rarely necessary.</Para><Para id="_944">Open resection and laparoscopic approaches both are  safe.<Reference refidx="60"/> There is no evidence that the carbon dioxide insufflation triggers a catecholamine crisis.<Reference refidx="60"/>
Open resection is recommended for tumors larger than 6 cm because of the increased risk of technical difficulty within the confined and closed space created with only carbon dioxide insufflation during laparoscopy. Additionally, there is an increased risk of tumor rupture with laparoscopic approaches, and they are inferior regarding nodal sampling.<Reference refidx="61"/>    However,  patients experience faster resolution of postoperative ileus; decreased analgesic requirements; a shorter hospital stay; and shorter convalescence, with a quicker  return to normal activity  with laparoscopic approaches.<Reference refidx="15"/>  Direct access to the para-aortic region can be achieved with the posterior approach.  Robotic assistance has improved the technique by offering a 3-dimensional, magnified view of the anatomy.<Reference refidx="62"/>    For an anterior open resection, incisions are based on the tumor location.  Cardiopulmonary bypass may be required for tumors in the middle mediastinum because they usually involve the left atrium.<Reference refidx="63"/> Posterior mediastinal tumors may require posterior thoracotomy.  Tumors located in the bladder may require partial cystectomy. Regardless of tumor size, all patients should undergo evaluation for metastasis.</Para><Para id="_945">In summary, surgical resection is the treatment of choice for patients with PGL.  If the disease is limited at the time of diagnosis, surgical resection can be undertaken with curative intent.  If disease is more extensive or locally recurrent, then surgical intervention is undertaken for tumor debulking and palliation.<Reference refidx="58"/> In patients with noncurable disease, surgery of the primary tumor and/or metastases could reduce hormone secretion and may be appropriate to prevent complications related to a critical anatomical location.<Reference refidx="64"/>  Surgery should be performed in referral centers and by expert hands. Long-term follow-up may identify metastases years after the  initial diagnosis. </Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">DeLellis RA, Lloyd RV, Heitz PU, et al., eds.: Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of Endocrine Organs.
