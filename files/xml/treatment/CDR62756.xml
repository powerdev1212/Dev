However, from 2007 to 2011, rates
in women younger than 50 years  were stable among whites
and decreased by 3.4% per year among blacks; in women aged 50 years or
older, rates declined by 2.5% per year in whites and by 3.8% per
year in blacks. Mortality rates were
stable among women younger than 50 years but decreased by 1.1% per
year among women aged 50 years and older.<Reference refidx="1"/>  This improvement has been attributed largely to screening with the Papanicolaou  (Pap) test.</Para><Para id="_209">Invasive squamous carcinoma of the cervix results from the progression of preinvasive precursor lesions called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), or dysplasia.  CIN is histologically graded into mild dysplasia (CIN 1), moderate dysplasia (CIN 2), or severe dysplasia (CIN 3).  Not all of these lesions progress to invasive cancer; many mild and moderate lesions regress.  A further categorization, the Bethesda system, is based on cytologic findings: atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) or cannot rule out low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), LSIL (consisting of cytologic atypia and CIN 1), and  high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), primarily CIN 2–3 plus carcinoma <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis>.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_210">The rate at which invasive cancer develops from CIN is usually slow, measured in years and perhaps decades.<Reference refidx="3"/> This long natural history provides the opportunity for screening to effectively detect this process during the preinvasive phase, thus allowing early treatment and cure.  Because many of these preinvasive lesions (especially  LSIL) would have never progressed to invasive cancer,<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>  screening also runs the risk of leading to treatment for women who do not need to be treated.</Para><Para id="_211">Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an oncogenic virus and the etiologic agent of cervical cancer and related premalignant disease. HPV is transmitted by sexual contact.  Sexually inactive women rarely develop cervical cancer, while sexual activity at an early age with multiple sexual partners is a strong risk factor.<Reference refidx="7"/> Nearly all women with invasive cervical cancer have evidence of HPV infection.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/> Most women with HPV infection, however, never develop cervical cancer; thus this infection is necessary but not sufficient for development of cancer.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_212">Although cervical cancer mortality increases with age,<Reference refidx="13"/> the prevalence of CIN is highest among women in their 20s and 30s.  Mortality is rare among women younger than 30 years; HSIL is rare among women older than 65 years who have been previously screened.  About 70% of ASCUS and CIN 1 lesions regress within 6 years, while about 6% of CIN 1 lesions progress to CIN 3 or worse.  In about 10% to 20% of women with CIN 3 lesions, the lesions progress to invasive cancer.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="14"/></Para><Para id="_213">Cervical cancer mortality is about 40% higher in black women younger than 65 years than in  white women of the same age.  Among women older than 65 years, cervical cancer mortality for black women is more than 150% higher than for white women.<Reference refidx="13"/>  In either case, mortality is rare among women of any age who have regular screenings.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_83"><Title>The Pap Test</Title><Para id="_215">The  Pap test has never been examined in a randomized controlled trial.  A large body of consistent observational data, however, supports its effectiveness in reducing mortality from cervical cancer.  Both incidence and mortality from cervical cancer have sharply decreased in a number of large populations following the introduction of well-run screening programs.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/> In Iceland, the mortality rate declined by 80% for more than 20 years, and in Finland and Sweden by 50% and 34%, respectively.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="19"/> Similar reductions have been observed in large populations in the United States and Canada.  Reductions in cervical cancer incidence and mortality were proportional to the intensity of screening.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="19"/>  Mortality in the Canadian
provinces was reduced most remarkably in British Columbia, which had screening
rates two to five times those of the other provinces.<Reference refidx="20"/></Para><Para id="_217">Case-control studies have found that the risk of developing invasive cervical
cancer is three to ten times greater in women who have not been screened.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/> 
Risk also increases with long duration following the last normal Pap test, or
similarly, with decreasing frequency of screening.<Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/>  Screening every 2 to
3 years, however, has not been found to increase significantly the risk of
finding invasive cervical cancer above the risk expected with annual
screening.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/>
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_54"><Title>Accuracy of the Pap Test</Title><Para id="_224">Ideally, determining the sensitivity and specificity of a screening test would involve a study that applies a “gold standard” test (such as colposcopy with appropriate biopsy) to all participants (whether the screening test is positive or negative). Sensitivity (the percentage of “true-positive” cases  that are detected by the screening test) and specificity (the percentage of "true-negative" cases that are negative by the screening test) could be calculated.  Such studies have rarely been done for any screening test for cervical cancer.  Studies that compare the Pap test with repeat Pap testing have found that the sensitivity of any abnormality on a single test for detecting high-grade lesions is 55% to 80%.<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/> Because of the usual slow-growing nature of cervical cancer, the sensitivity of a program of regular Pap testing is likely higher.</Para><Para id="_74">To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Pap smear,  both a test threshold (i.e., the point at which the test will be considered to be “positive”) and a reference-standard threshold (i.e., the point at which the reference standard is considered to be “positive”) must be defined.    In practice, ASCUS is often used as the test threshold, and CIN 1 is often used as the reference threshold.  This combination gives a sensitivity of about 68% and a specificity of about 75%.  A more appropriate test threshold may be LSIL, with a reference threshold of CIN 2–3.  This combination gives a sensitivity of 70% to 80%, with a specificity of about 95%.<Reference refidx="30"/></Para><Para id="_225">One important factor in the accuracy of the Pap test is the adequacy of the specimen obtained.  Adequate training and using  techniques such as the cytobrush may improve sensitivity.<Reference refidx="31"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_226"><Title>New Screening Technologies</Title><Para id="_227">Newer techniques that employ liquid-based cytology (e.g., ThinPrep) have been developed to improve the sensitivity of screening.  As with the Pap test, the optimal studies to determine the sensitivity and specificity of these technologies have not been done.  Some less-than-optimal studies show that sensitivity is modestly higher for detecting any degree of CIN, with modestly lower specificity.<Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/>   One careful study, however, showed that conventional Pap testing was slightly more sensitive and specific than liquid-based cytology.<Reference refidx="34"/></Para><Para id="_233">The evidence is also mixed about whether liquid-based techniques improve rates of test adequacy.<Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/>  One advantage of liquid-based cytology is that <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062756#_248" url="/types/cervical/hp/cervical-screening-pdq">HPV testing</SummaryRef> can be done on the same preparation; one disadvantage is that liquid-based approaches are more expensive than conventional Pap testing.  No study has examined whether liquid-based cytology actually reduces the number of women dying of cervical cancer compared with conventional Pap testing.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_234"><Title>Screening Women Who Have Had a Hysterectomy</Title><Para id="_235">Women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix for benign disease rarely have important abnormalities found on Pap testing.  Several studies have shown that the rate of high-grade vaginal lesions or vaginal cancer is less than 1 in 1,000 tests;<Reference refidx="35"/><Reference refidx="36"/> no study has shown that screening for vaginal cancer reduces mortality from this rare condition.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_236"><Title>Screening Interval</Title><Para id="_237">Because cervical cancer is slow growing, considerable uncertainty surrounds the issue of the optimal screening interval.  The most direct evidence about this issue comes from a prospective cohort analysis of a randomized controlled trial.<Reference refidx="37"/>   Among 2,561 women (mean age 66.7 years) with normal Pap tests at baseline, 110 had an abnormal Pap test within the next 2 years.  No woman was found to have CIN 2–3 or invasive cancer, and only one had CIN 1–2.  Thus the positive-predictive value (PPV) of screening 1 year after a negative Pap test was 0%; after 2 years, the PPV was 0.9%.  The authors concluded that Pap tests should not be repeated within 2 years of a negative test. A large (n = 332,000) prospective cohort study of cervical cytology and HPV DNA co-testing in U.S. women aged 30 years and older found that a negative Pap smear was associated with a low risk for developing CIN 3 or cancer (CIN 3+) for up to 5 years after the test (cumulative incidence of CIN 3+ at 3 and 5 years was 0.17% and 0.36%, respectively).<Reference refidx="38"/></Para><Para id="_238">A large study that included data from the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program together with modeling found little further mortality reduction from cervical cancer for screening every year as compared with screening every 3 years.<Reference refidx="39"/> A similar modeling study from Australia found no differences between every 2 year and every 3 year screening.<Reference refidx="40"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_248"><Title>HPV Testing</Title><Para id="_249">Noninvasive cervical squamous cell abnormalities  are graded histologically as CIN 1, CIN 2, or CIN 3, according to the severity of the cell changes and the percent of the epithelium replaced by abnormal cell growth. CIN 3 is a reasonably reproducible diagnosis  and has an approximate 30% risk of developing into invasive cancer over many years if untreated.<Reference refidx="41"/> CIN 2 has poor interobserver reproducibility,<Reference refidx="42"/> and the biologic behavior is variable.<Reference refidx="43"/> CIN 3 is therefore a more rigorous endpoint for clinical trials, while CIN 2 represents the threshold for treatment to provide an additional measure of safety.</Para><Para id="_250">Approximately 15 cancer-associated (high-risk or carcinogenic) HPV genotypes cause virtually all cases of cervical cancer and precursor lesions of CIN 2 and CIN 3. However, carcinogenic HPV infections are very common, particularly in young women, and the majority clear on their own within 1 to 2                         years. Therefore, the challenge of incorporating HPV testing in cervical screening programs is to balance sensitivity for detection of CIN 2 or CIN 2+ and  to minimize the over-referral of women with transient HPV infections and cervical changes that are destined to regress.</Para><Para id="_251"> The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several HPV tests.  Most of these tests are based on the detection of DNA from one or more oncogenic types of HPV.  One test detects HPV RNA.  HPV testing is approved for use in two contexts: (1) as a second (i.e., triage) test following an equivocal cytology result of ASCUS; and (2) for primary screening in conjunction with cervical cytology for women aged 30 years and older.<Reference refidx="44"/> Testing for low-risk HPV types does not identify women at risk for CIN 2 or 3.<Reference refidx="45"/><Reference refidx="46"/></Para><SummarySection id="_167"><Title>Triage</Title><Para id="_258">A large randomized clinical trial, the ASCUS/LSIL Triage Study (ALTS), demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of using HPV testing to clarify the risk of an ASCUS Pap result.<Reference refidx="47"/>   ALTS randomly assigned women with ASCUS to one of three management strategies: Immediate colposcopy regardless of enrollment test results, referral to colposcopy if the HPV test was positive or if the enrollment cytology was  HSIL, and referral to colposcopy only if the cytology was HSIL. The HPV triage strategy was as sensitive for detection of CIN 2+ as immediate colposcopy, while referring only about half of the women for the procedure. Repeat cytology with referral to colposcopy at the threshold of HSIL was less sensitive for CIN 3+ (60%) compared with HPV triage (92%); however, using a cytologic threshold of ASCUS for referral increased sensitivity but resulted in 72% of women with ASCUS undergoing colposcopy.<Reference refidx="48"/> HPV testing is not recommended for adolescent women with ASCUS because most of these women are HPV positive.<Reference refidx="49"/><Reference refidx="50"/></Para><Para id="_255">HPV DNA testing is generally not appropriate or clinically useful following cytology results of LSIL, which is more severe than ASCUS, and most of these women (84%–96%) are carcinogenic HPV DNA positive.<Reference refidx="51"/> One exception may be to clarify the risk for postmenopausal women with cytologic LSIL, which is an interpretation that can be falsely positive, presumably due to atrophic changes.<Reference refidx="52"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_256"><Title>Primary screening</Title><Para id="_260">Testing for HPV DNA as a primary screening test has been FDA approved only in conjunction with cervical cytology and only in women aged 30 years and older. Women who are negative by cytology and HPV testing are at extremely low risk of CIN 3+ and therefore may be screened less often. A prospective cohort study of nearly 332,000 U.S. women aged 30 years  and older undergoing HPV DNA and cervical cytology co-testing every 3 years found that the cumulative incidence of CIN 3+ in women negative for both tests at baseline was 0.047% at 3 years and 0.16% at 5 years.<Reference refidx="38"/> Screening more frequently than every 3 years would not improve sensitivity significantly but would increase costs and overtreatment.<Reference refidx="53"/><Reference refidx="54"/></Para><Para id="_172">Numerous studies have demonstrated that, compared with cytology, HPV DNA testing is more sensitive for identifying women who have CIN 2+ (range of sensitivities 84%–97%).<Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="55"/><Reference refidx="56"/><Reference refidx="57"/><Reference refidx="58"/><Reference refidx="59"/><Reference refidx="60"/> In one randomized trial using both Pap and HPV testing in random order among women aged 30 to 69 years, sensitivity of HPV was 95% compared with 55% for Pap cytology.  The combination of HPV and cytology had 100% sensitivity and a referral rate of 7.9%.<Reference refidx="56"/></Para><Para id="_173">The lower specificity of HPV DNA testing compared with cytology is a consideration.   Among women older than 30 years, cytology had a specificity of 97% compared with 94% for HPV testing.<Reference refidx="56"/> The specificity of HPV DNA testing would likely be even lower among women younger than 30 years, who have more transient HPV infection that is of little consequence. Thus, detecting such women would potentially increase the number of follow-up diagnostic workups. Potential approaches to minimize over-referral with HPV DNA testing and improve specificity include: (1) triage HPV-positive results with cytology <Reference refidx="60"/> or another more specific molecular assay;<Reference refidx="61"/> and (2) trigger further workup only after two sequential positive HPV test results because it is the persistence of carcinogenic HPV that confers the greatest risk of CIN 2–3.<Reference refidx="62"/><Reference refidx="63"/></Para><Para id="_195">An Italian population-based randomized, controlled trial of HPV DNA testing versus cervical cytology performed at 3-year intervals in approximately 94,000 women aged 25 to 60 years found a statistically significant decrease in the number of invasive cervical cancer cases diagnosed in the HPV DNA arm at the second round of screening (0 cases vs. 9 cases; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> =             .004).  However, about 48% of individuals in the HPV DNA arm also received conventional cytology testing at the first screening round, making it impossible to discern whether the observed difference resulted from the use of a combined testing strategy or HPV DNA testing alone.  Of note, many more women in the HPV DNA arm were referred to colposcopy for abnormal findings than in the cytology-alone arm (4,436 women vs. 1,416 women), prompting the authors to conclude that if the HPV DNA test is used as a primary screening strategy, women with positive test results should be triaged by cytology before referral.<Reference refidx="64"/></Para><Para id="_174">A study using data from a population-based randomized trial of cervical screening among women aged 32 to 38 years compared 11 different screening strategies using HPV DNA testing and cytology.

Using the same adjustments, cervical cancer mortality rates demonstrated a 35% relative reduction in the intervention arm compared with the control group (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47–0.89); the age-standardized rate of death due to cervical cancer was 39.6 per 100,000 person-years for the intervention group versus 56.7 per 100,000 person-years for the control group.  However, the same authors have subsequently reported that HPV testing is superior at reducing cervical cancer mortality using the same cohort.<Reference refidx="70"/>  This population was essentially screen naive at entry into the study and demonstrated a much higher overall risk for cervical cancer death (11% of the controls) than that observed in the U.S. population; the applicability of these findings to the United States and similar western health care systems is therefore difficult to assess. Histological diagnosis of cervical lesions happened after treatment had already taken place, and approximately 27% of patients in this trial received cryotherapy for lesions later determined to be nonmalignant.<Reference refidx="71"/></Para><Para id="_310">A second cluster-randomized trial of VIA screening in low socioeconomic areas of urban Mumbai, India, similarly demonstrated its efficacy in reducing cervical cancer mortality.  In this trial, primary community health workers (as opposed to medical personnel) were trained to provide biennial VIA screening to 75,360 women aged 35 to 64 years.  Women with positive screening results were referred to a central hospital for free diagnostic confirmation (including Pap smear, colposcopy, and biopsy, if indicated) and treatment—where warranted—according to hospital protocol.  A control group (n = 76,178) received general cancer education.  After 12 years, the relative risk of dying from cervical cancer was reduced by 31% in the screening arm (rate ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54–0.88), corresponding to about 5 fewer deaths per 100,000 woman-years. Compliance with treatment was about 15% lower for those in the control arm, which may have inflated the observed mortality benefit somewhat.<Reference refidx="72"/></Para><Para id="_246">A study of the feasibility of single-visit management of high-grade cervical lesions was conducted among a predominantly Latina population in California.<Reference refidx="73"/> Women were randomly assigned to a single-visit group (n = 1,716) in which the Pap test was evaluated immediately and treatment administered the same day for women with HSIL or atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGUS) results; or to usual care (n = 1,805), with results of the Pap test provided within 2 to 4 weeks and referrals for treatment based on results.  The program was feasible, with a high degree of acceptability and results in 14 of 16 (88%) women with abnormal test results completing treatment by 6 months versus 10 of 19 (53%) women in the usual care arm completing treatment by 6 months.  Follow-up at 12 months was also higher among women in the single-visit group with HSIL/AGUS than among those in the usual-care arm; among all women, only 36% in each group had a follow-up Pap test at 1 year.</Para><Para id="_279">Self-collected HPV testing may be an alternative method for cervical screening in communities with limited access to health care providers.  A pooled analysis of cervical screening studies conducted in China compared sensitivity and specificity of self-collection of cervical specimens for  HPV DNA testing, physician-collected specimens for HPV testing, liquid-based cytology (LBC) and visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid (VIA).   The study included 13,004 participants in the analysis.   Women had all three sampling methods; in one study included in the pooled analysis, all women had colposcopy and biopsies.  Of note, the women were instructed in the self-collection methodology by physicians, which likely affected the quality of specimen collection and thus the accuracy of the test in these studies.  Physician-collected specimen HPV DNA testing had the highest sensitivity 97% for CIN 2+ (95% CI, 95.2%–98.3%) and 97.8 for CIN 3+ (95% CI, 95.3%–99.2%).  Self-collected specimen HPV testing had moderate agreement with physician-collected specimen testing (k = 0.67). Pooled sensitivity for self-collected HPV testing was 86.2% for CIN 2+ (95% CI, 82.9%–89.1%) and 86.1% for CIN 3+ (95% CI, 81.4%–90.0%).  Pooled specificity for self-collected HPV DNA testing was 80.7% (95% CI, 75.6%–85.8%) for CIN 2+ and 79.5% (95% CI, 74.1%–84.8%) for CIN 3+.  The specificity of HPV testing was lowest of all screening modalities.  Whereas pooled sensitivity was highest for physician-based HPV testing, it was lowest for the VIA screening methods—50.3% for CIN 2+ and 55.7% for CIN 3+.  Pooled specificity was highest for LBC—94.0% for CIN 2+ and 92.8% for CIN 3+.<Reference refidx="74"/></Para><Para id="_247">A randomized trial in South Africa evaluated the impact on diagnosis of CIN 2+ at 6 months with a screen-and-treat approach with VIA and  HPV versus delayed evaluation.<Reference refidx="75"/> Women underwent HPV DNA testing and VIA testing (n = 6,555) and then returned in 2 to 6 days and were randomly assigned to one of three groups to receive (1) cryotherapy if the HPV DNA test result was positive (n = 2,163; 473 HPV+ and 467 treated);  (2) cryotherapy if                   the   VIA test result was positive (n = 2,227; 492 VIA+ and 482 treated); or (3) delayed evaluation (n = 2,165).  At 6 months, CIN 2+ was  diagnosed in 0.80% of women in the HPV+/cryotherapy group, in  2.23% of the VIA+/cryotherapy group, and in 3.55% of the delayed evaluation group.  Differences in the prevalence of CIN 2+  persisted among the subset of women evaluated at 12 months. For the secondary outcome of CIN 3+, prevalence of CIN 3+ lesions was low among the three groups but followed the same pattern (two cases in the HPV DNA group, three cases in the VIA group, and eight cases in the delayed evaluation group).</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">American Cancer Society: Cancer Facts and Figures 2015.

Thus, Papanicolaou (Pap) test screening results in a large number of colposcopies for benign conditions.</Para><Para id="_110">The major potential harm of screening for cervical cancer lies in the screening detection of many cytologic abnormalities such as  atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and  low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), the majority of which would never progress to cervical cancer.  Women with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive ASCUS or   LSIL  on Pap testing are usually referred for colposcopy.         Histological CIN 2+ is   treated with cryotherapy or loop electrosurgical excision procedure. These procedures permanently alter the cervix and have consequences on fertility and pregnancy.<Reference refidx="3"/>       Younger women are more likely to acquire HPV infections and  be referred for diagnostic workup,   and  they are  more likely to suffer harms from interventions for a condition that often resolves spontaneously.</Para><Para id="_111">Based on an analysis of screening records from nearly 350,000 women in Bristol, England, investigators projected that 1,000 women would need to be screened for cervical cancer for 35 years to prevent one death from the disease. For each death prevented, the authors estimated that more than 150 women have an abnormal result, more than 80 women are referred for investigation, and more than 50 women have treatment.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="17392387">Solomon D, Breen N, McNeel T: Cervical cancer screening rates in the United States and the potential impact of implementation of screening guidelines.
