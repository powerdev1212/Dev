Fatigue is also a common <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045022">symptom</GlossaryTermRef> of some types of cancer. Patients describe fatigue  as feeling tired, weak,
worn-out,  heavy, slow, or that they have no energy or get-up-and-go. Fatigue in cancer patients may be called cancer fatigue, cancer-related fatigue, and cancer treatment-related fatigue. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_81"><KeyPoint id="_82">Fatigue related to cancer is different from  fatigue that healthy people feel.</KeyPoint><Para id="_75"> When a healthy person is tired by day-to-day activities, their fatigue can be relieved by sleep and rest. Cancer-related fatigue is different. Cancer patients get  tired after less activity than people who do not have cancer. Also, cancer-related fatigue is not completely relieved by sleep and rest and  may last for a long time.  Fatigue usually decreases after cancer treatment ends,  but patients may still feel some fatigue for months or years.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_85"><KeyPoint id="_86">Fatigue can decrease a patient's quality of life. </KeyPoint><Para id="_77">Fatigue can affect all areas of  life by  making the  patient too tired to take part in daily activities, relationships, social events, and community activities. Patients may miss work or school, spend less time with friends and family, or spend more time sleeping. In some cases, physical fatigue leads to mental fatigue and mood changes. This can make it hard for the patient to  pay attention,  remember things,  and think clearly. Money may become a problem if the patient needs to take leave from a job or stop working completely. Job loss can lead to the loss of health insurance. All these things can lessen the patient's <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000450120">self-esteem</GlossaryTermRef>.

Some studies show that fatigue is caused by:</Para><ItemizedList id="_113" Style="bullet"><ListItem> The need for extra energy to repair and heal body <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissue</GlossaryTermRef> damaged by treatment.</ListItem><ListItem>The build-up of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043986">toxic</GlossaryTermRef> substances that are  left in the body after <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046476">cells</GlossaryTermRef> are killed by cancer treatment.</ListItem><ListItem>The effect of biologic therapy on the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356">immune system</GlossaryTermRef>.</ListItem><ListItem>Changes in the body's sleep-wake cycle.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_78"> When they begin cancer treatment, many patients are already tired from medical tests, surgery, and the emotional stress of coping with the cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046450">diagnosis</GlossaryTermRef>.

 After treatment begins, fatigue may get worse. Patients who are older, have advanced cancer, or receive more than one type of treatment (for example, both chemotherapy and radiation therapy) are more likely to have long-term fatigue. </Para><Para id="_232">Different cancer treatments have different effects on a patient's energy level. The type and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000346524">schedule</GlossaryTermRef> of treatments can affect the amount of fatigue caused by cancer therapy.  </Para><SummarySection id="_115"><KeyPoint id="_116">Fatigue caused by chemotherapy</KeyPoint><Para id="_231">Patients treated with chemotherapy usually feel the most fatigue in the days right after each treatment. Then the fatigue decreases until the next treatment.  Fatigue usually increases with each cycle. Some studies have shown that patients have the most severe fatigue about mid-way through all the cycles of chemotherapy. Fatigue decreases after chemotherapy is finished, but patients may not feel back to normal until a month or more after the last treatment.

After radiation therapy begins, fatigue usually  increases until  mid-way through the course of treatments and then stays about the same until treatment ends.  For many patients, fatigue improves after radiation therapy stops. However, in some patients, fatigue will last months or years after treatment ends. Some patients  never have the same amount of energy they had before treatment. </Para><Para id="_247">Cancer-related fatigue has been studied in patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000444971">breast cancer</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000445079">prostate cancer</GlossaryTermRef>.

Fatigue may occur if the body does not take in enough food to give the body the energy it needs. For many patients, the effects of cancer and cancer treatments make it hard to eat well.

It's common for cancer patients to have changes in moods and attitudes. Patients may feel anxiety and fear before and after a cancer diagnosis.  These feelings may 
cause fatigue. The effect of the disease on the patient's physical, mental, social, and financial well-being can increase emotional <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454701">distress</GlossaryTermRef>.  </Para><Para id="_228">About 15% to 25% of

This is called  attention fatigue. Sleep
helps to  relieve attention fatigue,  but sleep may not be enough when the fatigue is related to cancer. Taking part  in restful activities and  spending time outdoors may help relieve attention fatigue.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_103"><KeyPoint id="_104">Not sleeping well may cause fatigue. </KeyPoint><Para id="_143">Some people with cancer are not able to get enough sleep.

Managing chronic fatigue includes adjusting to  life with fatigue. Learning the facts  about cancer-related fatigue may help you cope with it better and improve quality of life.  For example, some patients in  treatment worry that having fatigue means the treatment is not working.  Anxiety over this can make fatigue even worse. Some patients  may feel  that reporting fatigue is complaining.

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/espanol/recursos/pdq">Spanish</ExternalRef>.</Para><Para id="_AboutThis_4">PDQ is a service of the NCI.

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_AboutThis_10"><Title>Clinical Trial Information</Title><Para id="_AboutThis_11">A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
