has prompted much interest in this virus as a potential anticancer agent. This phenomenon is apparently caused by defects in intracellular antiviral defenses of some cancer cells.<Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/> NDV was historically  considered a CAM approach, but in recent years it has been extensively studied by the conventional medical community.  Also, genetically engineered NDV strains are being developed and studied for their anticancer activity.<Reference refidx="27"/></Para><Para id="_8">The <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046391">genetic</GlossaryTermRef> material of NDV is <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046568">RNA</GlossaryTermRef> rather
than <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045671">DNA</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="31"/>         As
with other types of viruses, essentially all of NDV’s <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044624">replication cycle</GlossaryTermRef> takes place
inside infected cells, which are also known as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044597">host cells</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="32"/>
During a replication cycle, new virus <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046092">proteins</GlossaryTermRef> and copies of the NDV genetic
material (i.e., <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044593">genome</GlossaryTermRef>) are made in the
host cell’s <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044586">cytoplasm</GlossaryTermRef>.  NDV is also an 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044588">enveloped virus</GlossaryTermRef>, which means
that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044616">progeny</GlossaryTermRef> virus particles are
released from infected cells by budding off from them.<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="33"/>
In this process, single copies of the NDV genome become wrapped in an outer
coat (i.e., an envelope) that is made from a small piece of the host cell’s 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044615">plasma membrane</GlossaryTermRef>. Generally, the NDV outer coat contains only virus proteins
that have been specifically inserted into the host cell's plasma
membrane;<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/> however, some host cell proteins may be
included as well.<Reference refidx="34"/><Reference refidx="35"/> Two specific virus proteins, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044595">hemagglutinin-neuraminidase</GlossaryTermRef>   and the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044591">fusion protein</GlossaryTermRef>, are the main NDV
proteins found  in the outer coat of isolated virus particles.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="30"/></Para><Para id="_9">There are many different strains of NDV, and they have been classified as
either <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044837">lytic</GlossaryTermRef> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044838">nonlytic</GlossaryTermRef> for human cells.  Lytic strains and nonlytic strains
both appear to replicate much more efficiently in human cancer cells than they
do in most normal human cells,<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="36"/> and viruses of
both strain types have been investigated as potential anticancer agents. One
major difference between lytic strains and nonlytic strains is that lytic
strains are able to make infectious progeny virus particles in human cells,
whereas nonlytic strains are not.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="37"/> This difference
is due to the ability of lytic strains to produce activated
hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and fusion protein <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045065">molecules</GlossaryTermRef> in the outer coat of progeny
viruses in human cells. The progeny virus particles made by nonlytic strains
contain inactive versions of these molecules. Activated
hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and fusion protein molecules are required for NDV
to enter a cell to replicate.  Initial binding of NDV to a host cell takes
place through the interaction of hemagglutinin-neuraminidase molecules in the
virus coat with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044623">sialic-acid</GlossaryTermRef>–containing molecules (i.e., 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044592">gangliosides</GlossaryTermRef>) on the surface of the
cell. It is important to note, however, that nonlytic strains of NDV can make
infectious progeny viruses in some types of nonhuman cells (e.g., chicken 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044202">embryo</GlossaryTermRef> cells), thereby allowing these strains to be maintained.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="36"/></Para><Para id="_10">Another major difference between lytic strains and nonlytic strains is
that, although they both have the potential to kill infected cells, the
mechanisms by which they accomplish this result are different. The production
of infectious progeny virus particles by lytic strains gives them the ability
to kill host cells fairly quickly. The budding of progeny viruses that
contain activated hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and fusion protein molecules in
their outer coats causes the plasma membrane of NDV-infected cells to fuse
with the plasma membrane of adjacent cells, leading to the production of
large, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044604">inviable</GlossaryTermRef> fused cells known as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044625">syncytia</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="12"/> <Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="30"/> The
more efficiently a lytic strain can replicate inside a host cell, the more
quickly it can kill that cell. The preferential killing of cancer cells by a
lytic virus is known as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044612">oncolysis</GlossaryTermRef>;
thus, lytic strains of NDV are also called oncolytic strains. Nonlytic
strains of NDV kill infected cells more slowly, with death apparently the
result of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044629">viral</GlossaryTermRef> disruption of normal host
cell metabolism.<Reference refidx="36"/><Reference refidx="38"/></Para><Para id="_192">The specific mechanism by which nonlytic NDV strains cause cell death in cancer cells has not been completely elucidated, but in Vero cells (derived from kidney epithelium) it was determined that NDV caused cell death by decreasing DNA content, increasing the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2, increasing p53 level, and increasing caspase expression, resulting in apoptosis.<Reference refidx="39"/><Reference refidx="40"/><Reference refidx="41"/></Para><Para id="_11">As indicated previously, both lytic strains and nonlytic strains have been
investigated for their anticancer potential. In fact, the major differences
between the two strain types have been exploited to develop three different
approaches to cancer therapy:</Para><OrderedList id="_12" Style="Arabic">
         <ListItem>The infection of cancer patients with a lytic strain of NDV.</ListItem>
         <ListItem>The use of

anticancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045938">vaccines</GlossaryTermRef>.</ListItem>
         <ListItem>The use of intact cancer cells infected with a nonlytic strain of NDV as

        </OrderedList><Para id="_13">One proposed advantage of the first approach is that virus replication may
allow the spread of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044020">cytotoxic</GlossaryTermRef> viruses
to every cancer cell in the body;<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="34"/> however, the production of 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044631">virus-neutralizing
antibodies</GlossaryTermRef> by the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356">immune system</GlossaryTermRef> might limit this possibility.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="40"/> The rationale for the second and third approaches is that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044628">tumor-specific antigens</GlossaryTermRef>
(i.e., proteins or other molecules that are generally located in the plasma
membrane of cancer cells and that are either unique to cancer cells or much
more abundant in them) may be better recognized by the immune system if they
are associated with virus <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046086">antigens</GlossaryTermRef>
(i.e., virus proteins that have been inserted into the plasma membrane of host
cells).<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="34"/><Reference refidx="42"/><Reference refidx="43"/><Reference refidx="44"/><Reference refidx="45"/><Reference refidx="46"/><Reference refidx="47"/><Reference refidx="48"/> If this enhanced recognition takes
place, then it may increase the chance that cancer cells, whether they are
virus infected or not, will be recognized as foreign by the immune system
and be destroyed.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="47"/><Reference refidx="48"/></Para><Para id="_14">The principal developers of the third approach have stated that whole cell
vaccines can stimulate the immune system better than oncolysates, and that cells infected with a nonlytic strain of
NDV will remain intact in the body long enough to generate these more
effective immune responses.<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="36"/><Reference refidx="37"/><Reference refidx="38"/><Reference refidx="43"/><Reference refidx="46"/><Reference refidx="49"/><Reference refidx="50"/><Reference refidx="51"/> It should be noted that the
cancer cells used in the third approach are treated with enough <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044031">gamma radiation</GlossaryTermRef> to prevent
further cell division, but not enough to cause cell death, either before or
after they are infected with the nonlytic virus.<Reference refidx="49"/><Reference refidx="50"/><Reference refidx="52"/><Reference refidx="53"/><Reference refidx="54"/><Reference refidx="55"/><Reference refidx="56"/><Reference refidx="57"/><Reference refidx="58"/> <Reference refidx="13"/>
This precaution ensures that patients are not given a vaccine that contains
actively <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044572">proliferating</GlossaryTermRef> cancer
cells.</Para><Para id="_15">Either a patient’s own cancer cells (i.e., <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044912">autologous</GlossaryTermRef> cells) or cells from another
patient with the same type of cancer (i.e., <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044920">allogeneic</GlossaryTermRef> cells) can be used to make
oncolysates and whole cell vaccines. It is important to note that immune
system responses similar to those obtained with oncolysates and whole cell
vaccines may occur in patients infected with a lytic strain of NDV and that
these <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044085">responses</GlossaryTermRef> would be expected to
contribute to any observed anticancer effect. </Para><Para id="_16">To conduct <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044195">human studies</GlossaryTermRef> with viruses, vaccines, or other <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044510">biological</GlossaryTermRef> 
materials in the United States, researchers must file an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044763">Investigational</GlossaryTermRef> New
Drug (IND) application with the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454785">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</GlossaryTermRef> (FDA).
Biological materials and drugs have been held to similar safety and
effectiveness standards since 1972. In an IND application, researchers must
provide safety and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043986">toxicity</GlossaryTermRef> data from <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044512">laboratory</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454774">animal studies</GlossaryTermRef> to justify
the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044664">dose</GlossaryTermRef>, the route, and the schedule of administration to be used in the
proposed clinical studies. Among the safety issues to be addressed,
researchers must demonstrate an absence of harmful contaminants. Most human
studies of NDV as an anticancer agent have taken place outside the United
States; therefore, they have not required an IND. At present, at least one group of U.S. <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044685">investigators</GlossaryTermRef> has filed an IND application to study NDV as an anticancer treatment.<Reference refidx="59"/> It should be noted that the FDA has not approved the use of NDV to treat any medical condition.</Para><Para id="_17">The NDV strains that have been evaluated most widely for the treatment of

mouse macrophages both <Emphasis>in vitro</Emphasis> and <Emphasis>in vivo</Emphasis> by infection with NDV strain
Ulster. Similar activation of mouse macrophages <Emphasis>in vitro</Emphasis> was observed after
infection with the NDV lytic strain Lasota. In this study, the activated
macrophages showed cytotoxic activity toward ESb, P815 mastocytoma, and Ca
761-P93 mammary carcinoma cells <Emphasis>in vitro</Emphasis>.  Other experiments demonstrated
that much of the observed anticancer activity could be attributed to the

the infected, activated macrophages showed anticancer activity <Emphasis>in vivo</Emphasis> when
they were injected into mice bearing Ca 761-P93 mammary carcinoma or Lewis
lung carcinoma tumors.<Reference refidx="36"/> Human macrophages stimulated with NDV  Ulster have also been shown to kill various types of human tumor cells.<Reference refidx="52"/></Para><Para id="_51">In another study,<Reference refidx="11"/> intratumoral injection of NDV strain

the remaining mice, tumor growth and metastatic spread continued at the same
rate as in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044585">control animals</GlossaryTermRef>.
Additional results from this study indicated that the anticancer effect in the

antigen.</Para><Para id="_52">Other studies with NDV Ulster and the ESb tumor model support the idea that
virus proteins inserted in the plasma membrane of NDV-infected cancer cells

irradiated ESb cells after surgery to remove a growing ESb <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045847">primary tumor</GlossaryTermRef> can prevent the growth

conducted two phase II studies. The phase II studies tested the ability of NDV
oncolysates to delay the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044078">progression</GlossaryTermRef>

was detected in 1 to 3 regional lymph nodes in 84% of the patients, in
4 to 5 regional lymph nodes in 9% of the patients, and in 6 to 8 
regional lymph nodes in 6% of the patients.  The second phase II study was
initiated 4 years after the start of the first one, and it involved 51
additional patients.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="11"/> Among these latter patients, 66% had melanoma
detected in 1 to 3 regional lymph nodes, 16% had melanoma detected in
4 to 5 regional lymph nodes, and 18% had melanoma detected in 6 or
more regional lymph nodes.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_130">In both studies, the patients were given subcutaneous injections of NDV 
oncolysates once a week for 4 weeks, beginning 4 to 8 weeks after surgery,
followed by more subcutaneous injections given every 2 weeks until 1 year
after surgery, and then continued subcutaneous injections given at intervals
that increased gradually to every 3 months over the course of a 5-year period.
From years 5 through 15 after surgery, some patients received additional 
oncolysate injections, which were given at intervals varying in length from 3
months to 6 months. Four of the patients in the first study were treated with
both autologous and allogeneic vaccines, whereas the remaining patients in
that study and all of the patients in the second study were treated with 
allogeneic vaccines only.  Five years after surgery, 72% of the
patients in the first study and 63% of the patients in the second study were
reported to be alive and free of detectable melanoma.<Reference refidx="11"/> The corresponding
survival value for historical control subjects who had palpable regional
disease was approximately 17% (a value derived from the scientific
literature).<Reference refidx="11"/> Ten years after surgery, 69% of the patients in the first
study and 59% of the patients in the second study were reported to be alive
and free of detectable melanoma,<Reference refidx="2"/> compared with survival values of 5% to
15% for historical control subjects who had palpable regional disease or 33%
for historical control subjects who had either palpable regional disease or 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044608">microscopic</GlossaryTermRef> evidence of regional
lymph node  metastasis.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> Fifteen years after surgery, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044070">overall survival</GlossaryTermRef> values of 59% and
53% were reported for patients in the first and second studies, respectively,
with one survivor in the first study experiencing metastatic disease.<Reference refidx="1"/> In
general, survival in these two studies did not seem to be influenced by the
number of regional lymph nodes that were positive for cancer at the time of
radical lymph node dissection, and the patients who received both autologous
and allogeneic vaccines did not appear to fare any better than the patients
who received allogeneic vaccines only.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_131">The fourth U.S. study of NDV oncolysates in patients with melanoma was also
a phase II trial.<Reference refidx="6"/> This trial, which was conducted by a different group of
researchers, involved 24 patients who likewise had disease that had spread to
regional lymph nodes. The patients in this trial were treated in a manner
similar to that of the patients in the other two phase II trials. In this
trial, however, only 37% of the patients remained disease free 5 years after
surgery;     this  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044023">disease-free
survival</GlossaryTermRef> percentage  did not differ substantially from the 30% 
disease-free survival estimated for a group of historical control subjects who
had been treated at the same institution with surgery alone or surgery and
another type of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045587">adjuvant therapy</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_132">In contrast to the evidence of benefit found in the other phase II trials, the absence of benefit for NDV oncolysates in this fourth clinical trial
remains to be explained. It has been reported that different methods of 
oncolysate preparation were used by the two groups of investigators who
conducted these studies.<Reference refidx="51"/> The positive results obtained by the first
research group, however, must be viewed with caution. Until these results are
confirmed independently in larger, randomized clinical trials, they should be
considered preliminary.</Para><Para id="_133">Two additional phase II studies of NDV oncolysates have been conducted in
Germany. One study involved 208 patients with locally advanced <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044988">renal cell
carcinoma</GlossaryTermRef> (i.e., large tumors and no regional lymph node metastasis or tumors
of any size and 1 or 2 regional lymph nodes positive for cancer).<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="12"/>
The second study involved 22 patients with either metastatic breast cancer or
metastatic ovarian cancer.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_134">In the advanced renal cell carcinoma study,<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="12"/> strain 73-T was used to
prepare autologous oncolysates that were given to patients by subcutaneous
injection once a week for 8 to 10 weeks beginning 1 to 3 months after radical
surgery (i.e., <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046265">nephrectomy</GlossaryTermRef> and  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044620">
regional lymph node  dissection</GlossaryTermRef>). Two <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046130">cytokines</GlossaryTermRef>,  low-dose <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044619">recombinant</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045256">interleukin-2</GlossaryTermRef> and recombinant
 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045324">interferon</GlossaryTermRef>-alpha, were added to the oncolysate vaccines. Among the 208
patients who entered this study, 203 were followed for a period of time that
ranged from 6 months to 64 months from the date of surgery, and these patients
were considered <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044029">evaluable</GlossaryTermRef> for
response.  Approximately 91% of the evaluable patients remained free of
detectable cancer during follow-up; 9% showed signs of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045850">progressive disease</GlossaryTermRef>. The 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044941">median</GlossaryTermRef> time to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045866">relapse</GlossaryTermRef> was more than 21 months. Fifty-six
of the evaluable patients had 23 months to 64 months of follow-up from the
time of surgery, and approximately 18% of these individuals showed signs of
progressive disease during follow-up. All relapses in this subset of 56
patients occurred within 34 months of surgery.</Para><Para id="_135">The researchers who conducted this study concluded that the results
demonstrated improved disease-free survival for the study subjects in
comparison with survival data published in the scientific literature for
similar patients who were treated with surgery alone.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="12"/> Because this
study was <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044092">uncontrolled</GlossaryTermRef>, however, it is not clear whether the improvement in 
disease-free survival was due to chance alone, to oncolysate therapy alone, to
cytokine therapy alone, or to the combination of oncolysate therapy and
cytokine therapy.</Para><Para id="_136">The same research group conducted a parallel investigation in which <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356">immune
system</GlossaryTermRef> responses to combination oncolysate and cytokine therapy were measured
in 38 patients who had advanced renal cell carcinoma.<Reference refidx="3"/> In this parallel
study, responses to NDV <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046086">antigens</GlossaryTermRef> (i.e., the production of anti-NDV antibodies)
and transient increases in blood levels of the cytokines interferon-alpha,
interferon-gamma, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045290">tumor necrosis factor</GlossaryTermRef> (TNF)-alpha were found, but responses thought to be
important to effective antitumor immunity (i.e., the production of  antibodies
against tumor-specific antigens, increases in natural killer  (NK) cell activity,
and increases in blood levels of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044594">helper T cells</GlossaryTermRef> [i.e., CD4 antigen–positive
cells] and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045664">cytotoxic T cells</GlossaryTermRef> [i.e., CD8  antigen–positive cells]) were
not.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_137">The phase II study of NDV oncolysates in patients with metastatic <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000304766">breast</GlossaryTermRef> or
metastatic <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044984">ovarian</GlossaryTermRef> cancer was described by its investigators as a study of 
autologous, whole cell vaccines.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="7"/>  The lytic strain Italien, however, was
used in this study, so it is likely that immune system responses in the
treated patients were stimulated by cellular fragments rather than by intact
cancer cells.</Para><Para id="_138">In the study, 22 patients were <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044841">vaccinated</GlossaryTermRef> by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044602">intradermal</GlossaryTermRef> injection at
least 3 times during a 6- to 8-week period that began 2 weeks after surgery
to remove <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045772">malignant</GlossaryTermRef> cells (either 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045847">primary tumor</GlossaryTermRef> cells or metastatic tumor cells). The patients also received 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044050">intravenous injections</GlossaryTermRef> of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045253">cyclophosphamide</GlossaryTermRef>, high-dose
recombinant interleukin-2, and autologous lymphocytes that had been simulated
 <Emphasis>in vitro</Emphasis> by treatment with interleukin-2. The cyclophosphamide was
administered to block the activity of a class of T cells (i.e., suppressor T
cells) that might weaken the desired immune responses. On average, the
patients were followed for a period of 23 months from the time of surgery.
Nine patients were reported to have either a complete response or a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045819">partial response</GlossaryTermRef> after vaccine
therapy. Five patients had <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045884">stable disease</GlossaryTermRef>, and eight had
progressive disease. The average duration of response was 5 months, after
which disease progression was again observed. Blood samples taken from the
patients during therapy showed increases in the numbers of NK
cells and increases in serum concentrations of the cytokines interferon-alpha
and TNF-alpha, but these changes did not persist. No other immune system
responses were detected.  Because this was an uncontrolled study, it is
unclear whether any of the observed clinical and/or immune system responses
can be attributed to treatment with NDV oncolysates.  Furthermore, because the
lytic strain Italien was used in the study, the possibility that the observed
tumor regressions were due, in part, to oncolysis cannot be ruled out.</Para><Table id="_193">

nonlytic strain NDV Ulster was used to prepare autologous tumor cell vaccines
in all of the studies.</Para><Para id="_174">Data from a 2004 pilot clinical trial of an NDV-modified autologous tumor vaccine in 20 patients with stage III or IV head and neck squamous cell carcinomas suggest that the vaccine strategy can stimulate human antitumor immune responses in a manner similar to those found in animal models and may significantly prolong 5-year survival rates in this patient population. The study demonstrated the feasibility and safety of the vaccine regimen, and no major side effects were observed in any of the patients.<Reference refidx="53"/></Para><Para id="_81">The use of NDV-infected, whole cell vaccines in patients with either
locally advanced or metastatic colorectal carcinoma was examined in one phase I clinical trial and two  phase II clinical trials.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="22"/> The
phase I trial helped establish the optimum number of tumor cells and the
optimum amount of virus to use in the average patient to produce the best
possible immune response. Immune responses were monitored by means of a skin
test that measured the extent of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044042">inflammation</GlossaryTermRef> and hardening of the skin at 
vaccination sites (i.e., <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044587">
delayed-type hypersensitivity responses</GlossaryTermRef>). The exact number of patients
treated in this trial cannot be determined because nonidentical patient
populations were described in the two published study reports.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/> One

8 with stage III disease.<Reference refidx="20"/> It is also not clear whether findings from
individual patients were reported twice (i.e., in both trial reports). Patients
with metastatic disease were allowed to enter this trial only if they had a
solitary metastatic tumor.</Para><Para id="_82">In the trial, NDV-infected, autologous whole cell vaccines were
administered to patients by intradermal injection beginning 4 weeks after
surgery to remove the primary tumor or the metastatic tumor. Each patient
received a total of 5 vaccinations, 4 given at 10-day intervals and a
final booster given approximately 23 weeks after surgery. One of the study

immune system reactivity against uninfected, autologous tumor cells during the
vaccination program. These responses were monitored by injecting uninfected,
irradiated tumor cells into the skin and looking for delayed-type
hypersensitivity responses. <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044834">Histologic examination</GlossaryTermRef> of
several vaccination sites during the trial showed the presence of infiltrating
immune system cells. These infiltrating cells were composed primarily of
helper T cells; some cytotoxic T cells were also present, but <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045611">B cells</GlossaryTermRef> (i.e.,
antibody-producing cells) were either scarce or absent.<Reference refidx="19"/></Para><Para id="_83">The two phase II trials looked for evidence of 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043985">therapeutic</GlossaryTermRef> benefit in patients who
had either metastatic colorectal carcinoma <Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="22"/> or locally advanced
colorectal carcinoma.<Reference refidx="16"/> The trial that involved patients with metastatic
disease recruited 23 individuals whose colorectal cancer had recurred in the
liver following treatment of their primary tumor or whose colorectal cancer
and liver metastases were diagnosed at the same time.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="22"/> After surgery to
remove the primary tumor and/or the metastases, all patients appeared to be
free of residual cancer. NDV-infected, autologous tumor cells were then
administered by intradermal injection every 2 weeks beginning 2 weeks after
surgery. The total number of vaccinations given to the patients in this trial,
however, is not clear. One of the two trial reports indicates that each
patient received four vaccinations and a
 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044583">booster</GlossaryTermRef>, which was given approximately
23 weeks after surgery.<Reference refidx="15"/> The second trial report <Reference refidx="22"/> indicates that each
patient received five vaccinations and a booster. No additional treatment
(chemotherapy or radiation therapy) was allowed during the trial.</Para><Para id="_84">During 18 months of follow-up, 14  of the 23 (61%)  patients in this trial had
relapses of their cancer, compared with relapses in 20 of 23 (87%) historical
control subjects who were treated with surgery alone by the same surgeons at
the same hospital. Although this difference in disease-free survival was 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044167">statistically
significant</GlossaryTermRef>, there was no statistically significant difference in overall
survival between the study subjects and the historical control subjects. The
researchers also reported that, in general, the patients who had the strongest
immune system responses against uninfected autologous tumor cells after
vaccination had the longest disease-free survival times. It should be noted,
however, that the reporting of patient responses against uninfected autologous
tumor cells in this trial was inconsistent.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="22"/> One trial report,<Reference refidx="15"/> which
described results after 12 months of follow-up, indicates that 11 of 23
patients showed increased immune system reactivity against uninfected
autologous tumor cells during the vaccination program; whereas the second
trial report,<Reference refidx="22"/> which described results after 18 months of follow-up,
indicates that only 9 of 23 patients showed increased reactivity against
uninfected autologous tumor cells.</Para><Para id="_85">The phase II trial that involved patients with locally advanced colorectal
carcinoma (i.e., large tumors and no regional lymph node metastasis or tumors
of any size and regional lymph nodes that were positive for cancer) recruited
57 individuals.<Reference refidx="16"/> Among these 57 patients, 48 were treated with
NDV-infected, whole cell vaccines, and 9 were treated with vaccines composed
of autologous tumor cells and the
 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044123">bacterium</GlossaryTermRef>    
  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044581">Bacillus Calmette Guerin
(BCG)</GlossaryTermRef>, which also has been used as an immune system stimulator. Patients
recruited for this trial were treated first with surgery and then were given a
choice between participating in the trial or receiving chemotherapy. The
individuals who chose to participate in the trial were injected intradermally
with the appropriate autologous tumor cell vaccines every other week for a
total of 6 weeks (i.e., 3 vaccinations per patient) beginning 6 to 8 weeks
after surgery. The follow-up period ranged from 6 months to 43 months (median
of 22 months), and disease-free survival and overall survival were estimated
for the vaccinated patients and for 661 historical control subjects who were
treated with surgery alone. Two years after surgery, overall survival for the
patients who were treated with NDV-infected, autologous whole cell vaccines
was 98%, compared with 67% overall survival for the patients who were treated
with BCG tumor cell vaccines and 74% overall survival for the historical
control subjects. The differences in survival between the NDV/tumor-cell–vaccinated group and the other two groups were statistically significant.
Disease-free survival 2 years after surgery for the NDV/tumor-cell–treated
patients was 72%. The researchers who conducted this trial also reported that
overall survival for the NDV/tumor-cell–treated group was comparable to that of the group of patients (n = 15) who chose to be treated
with chemotherapy rather than immunotherapy.<Reference refidx="16"/></Para><Para id="_86">Two additional phase II studies investigated the use of NDV-infected,
autologous tumor cell vaccines in patients who had either ovarian cancer or
renal cell cancer.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="23"/> The ovarian cancer trial enrolled 82 patients, but
only 39 were evaluable for response.<Reference refidx="23"/> The published report of this trial,
however, described clinical findings for just 24 evaluable patients who had 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045901">stage III</GlossaryTermRef> disease;
results for the remaining evaluable patients (5 with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045899">stage I</GlossaryTermRef> disease, 5 with 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045900">stage II</GlossaryTermRef> disease, and
5  with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045902">stage IV</GlossaryTermRef> 
disease) were not presented. The patients in this trial were treated with
surgery and six courses of chemotherapy in addition to three courses of
intradermally administered immunotherapy, but details about the adjuvant
treatments (e.g., what constituted a course of immunotherapy or what
chemotherapy drugs were used in addition to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045230">cisplatin</GlossaryTermRef>) were very limited. Among the
24 evaluable patients with reported clinical findings, 15 had a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045651">complete remission</GlossaryTermRef>, 8 had a 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045818">partial remission</GlossaryTermRef>, and 1 had
progressive disease. The median disease-free survival time for the patients
who had a complete remission was 30 months. These results were described as
very encouraging by the investigators who conducted the study, but the
degree of benefit afforded by the immunotherapy in this uncontrolled study
cannot be established. In common with other studies of NDV-infected tumor cell 
vaccines, histologic examination of individual vaccination sites
revealed the presence of infiltrates consisting predominantly of helper T
cells.<Reference refidx="23"/></Para><Para id="_87">The phase II trial of NDV-infected, autologous tumor cell vaccines
in patients with renal cell cancer enrolled 40 individuals whose disease had
spread from the kidney to at least 1 other organ.<Reference refidx="21"/> The patients in this
trial underwent surgery (i.e., radical nephrectomy) to remove the primary
tumor and then were given intradermal injections of NDV-infected tumor cells
at 3 weeks and 5 weeks after surgery. The patients were also given
subcutaneous injections of low-dose recombinant interleukin-2 and recombinant
interferon-alpha. Five patients had a complete response, and six had a partial
response. After 4 years of follow-up, overall survival for these 11 responding
patients was 100%. Among the remaining 29 patients, 12 had stable disease
(median survival = 31 months) and 17 had progressive disease (median 
survival = 14 months). The researchers also reported a median survival time of
13 months for 36 historical control subjects who were
treated with surgery and other types of adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy, 
radiation therapy, or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045110">hormonal therapy</GlossaryTermRef>). The overall
percentage of patients with either a complete response or a partial response
in this uncontrolled study (i.e., 28%) is similar to that found in other
studies in which comparable patients were treated with cytokine therapy but
not vaccine therapy.<Reference refidx="21"/> Therefore, it is not clear whether any of the
apparent clinical benefit in this trial can be attributed to vaccination with
NDV-infected tumor cells.</Para><Para id="_88">A fifth phase II clinical trial tested NDV-infected, autologous tumor cell
vaccines in 43 patients who had various advanced cancers (16 ovarian, 22
breast, 1 cervical, 1 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044308">vaginal</GlossaryTermRef>, 1 lung,
and 1 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045221">chondrosarcoma</GlossaryTermRef>) that had
not responded to previous treatment.<Reference refidx="18"/> The patients in this trial received
intravenous injections of cyclophosphamide and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045194">epirubicin</GlossaryTermRef>, subcutaneous injections of
low-dose recombinant interleukin-2 and interferon-alpha, and intradermal
injections of the tumor cell vaccines. The cyclophosphamide and epirubicin
were administered to block the activity of suppressor T cells that might
weaken the desired immune responses. The trial report provided no information
about the treatments that had failed, the time intervals between the failure
of the last treatment and the beginning of immunotherapy, or how many
vaccinations each patient received. The researchers considered 31 of the 43
patients to be evaluable for response. Among the evaluable patients, one
individual who had ovarian cancer had a complete response that lasted more
than 2 months. The remaining evaluable patients had either partial responses
(n = 11), stable disease (n = 10), or progressive disease (n = 9) following
treatment. In view of the limited information given, no conclusions can be
drawn from this uncontrolled study about the effectiveness of NDV-infected,
autologous whole cell vaccines in this patient population.</Para><Para id="_89">One additional clinical study evaluated the effect of vaccine quality on
the survival of patients who were treated with NDV-infected, autologous tumor
cells.<Reference refidx="17"/> In this <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044956">retrospective study</GlossaryTermRef>,
survival was estimated separately for three groups of patients who had early
breast cancer (n = 63), metastatic breast cancer (n = 27), or metastatic ovarian
cancer (n = 31) and who had sufficient numbers of recovered tumor cells to allow
at least two vaccinations. Most of
the patients who had early breast cancer were treated after surgery with
conventional adjuvant therapies (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or
hormonal therapy) in addition to vaccine therapy. The patients who had
metastatic breast or ovarian cancer had failed to respond to conventional
treatments before the start of vaccine therapy. In addition to receiving tumor
cell vaccines, these latter patients were treated with oral <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045223">indomethacin</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045184">cimetidine</GlossaryTermRef>, intravenous cyclophosphamide
and epirubicin, and subcutaneous low-dose recombinant interleukin-2 and
interferon-alpha. The indomethacin, cimetidine, cyclophosphamide, and
epirubicin were given in an attempt to prevent the suppression of desired
immune system responses. The autologous vaccines were classified as either
high quality or low quality on the basis of the following two parameters:
the ratio of tumor cells to other types of cells and the percentage of live
tumor cells. The median times from surgery to the start of immunotherapy were
13 days, 27 days, and 28 days for the patients who had early breast cancer, 
metastatic breast cancer, and metastatic ovarian cancer, respectively.</Para><Para id="_90">Overall survival 4 years after surgery was estimated to be 96% for the
patients with early breast cancer who had received a high-quality vaccine
(n = 32), compared with an overall survival of 68% for those who
had received a low-quality vaccine (n = 31). For the patients with metastatic
breast cancer, the median survival time was estimated to be 1.75 years from
the start of immunotherapy for those who had received a high-quality vaccine
(n = 13), compared with a median survival time of 0.75 years for those who had
received a low-quality vaccine (n = 14) (median follow-up time = 1.4 years). For
patients with metastatic ovarian cancer, the median survival time was
estimated to be 1.16 years from the start of immunotherapy for those who had
received a high-quality vaccine (n = 18), compared with a median survival time
of 0.84 years for those who had received a low-quality vaccine (n = 13) (median
follow-up time = 1.23 years). The only survival difference that was
statistically significant was the one for the patients who had early breast
cancer. The 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044120">retrospective</GlossaryTermRef> nature of this study
and the small numbers of patients in each treatment group should be viewed as
major weaknesses.</Para><Para id="_91">In two of the above-mentioned studies, the phase I colorectal cancer study
<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/> and the phase II ovarian cancer study,<Reference refidx="23"/> histologic examination of
several vaccination sites revealed the presence of infiltrating immune system
cells. These infiltrating cells, however, consisted primarily of helper T
cells (CD4 antigen–positive cells); cytotoxic T cells (CD8 antigen–positive
cells) were present, but only as a minor component. In another study,<Reference refidx="27"/>
vaccination sites from five cancer patients (two with colon cancer, two with
melanoma, and one with ovarian cancer) also contained infiltrates of
predominantly helper T cells. In fact, CD8 antigen–positive T cells could not
be detected in the lymphocytes <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044017">cultured</GlossaryTermRef> from vaccination sites of
two of these five patients.<Reference refidx="27"/> <Reference refidx="22"/> The presence of small numbers
of cytotoxic T cells at vaccination sites may be an important factor to
consider when evaluating the results of the whole cell vaccine trials because
animal studies <Reference refidx="54"/><Reference refidx="55"/><Reference refidx="56"/><Reference refidx="57"/> <Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="58"/><Reference refidx="59"/><Reference refidx="60"/><Reference refidx="61"/><Reference refidx="62"/><Reference refidx="63"/><Reference refidx="64"/><Reference refidx="65"/><Reference refidx="66"/> and
human studies <Reference refidx="1"/> have suggested that this class of T cells is required for
effective, long-term anticancer immunity. It should also be noted that, in
another study,<Reference refidx="67"/> increases in NK cell activity were measured in
blood samples from two patients with colorectal cancer who exhibited
delayed-type hypersensitivity responses at vaccination sites, but cytotoxic T
cells directed against tumor-specific antigens could not be detected. Overall,
these results indicate that NDV-infected, autologous, whole cell vaccines may
be able to stimulate NK cell activity, which may have contributed
the clinical outcomes described above, but also that these vaccines may
be ineffective in promoting at least one additional immune system response
(i.e., the production of tumor-specific antigen-targeted cytotoxic T cells)
thought to be important to establishing long-term anticancer immunity. Whether
the inclusion of bispecific monoclonal antibodies (refer to the 
<SummaryRef href="CDR0000062978#_30" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/ndv-pdq">Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information) in the whole cell vaccines will
make them more effective remains to be determined.</Para><Table id="_194">

clinical trial that included 33 patients in the NDV treatment group and 26
patients in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046688">placebo</GlossaryTermRef> group.<Reference refidx="39"/> The
patients in the phase II trial had various advanced cancers.<Reference refidx="39"/> According to
the investigators, MTH-68 treatment was beneficial for the majority of these
patients.</Para><Para id="_104">The five patients described in the case report and the small case series
were reported to have had either a complete remission or a partial remission
following NDV therapy.<Reference refidx="38"/><Reference refidx="42"/> Two of the patients in the case series had
advanced colorectal cancer, another had melanoma, and the fourth had advanced
Hodgkin disease.<Reference refidx="38"/> These five patients were treated with NDV daily for
periods of time that ranged from 1 month to 7 years. Inhalation and
intravenous injection were the main routes of virus administration. One of the
patients with colorectal cancer, however, was treated by means of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044601">intracolonic</GlossaryTermRef> injection (i.e., via a
colostomy opening) for 4 weeks. It is important to note that all five patients
were treated with conventional therapy before the start of NDV therapy and
that four of the five received conventional therapy either 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044011">concurrently</GlossaryTermRef> with NDV therapy
or after it. Given the small number of patients, the absence of control
subjects, and the overlapping treatments, it is difficult to draw conclusions
about the effectiveness of NDV therapy from these small studies. Nonetheless, taken as a whole the results of the available NDV studies suggest potential clinical value warranting further study with controlled clinical trials.</Para><Para id="_105">In the phase II trial,<Reference refidx="39"/> NDV was administered by inhalation only 2 times
a week for a period of 6 months. The 33 patients in the NDV treatment group
had the following types of cancer: colorectal (n = 13), stomach (n = 6), kidney
(n = 3), pancreatic (n = 3), lung (n = 1), breast (n = 1),
ovarian (n = 1), melanoma (n = 1), <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046738">bile

(n = 1), and
 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046432">ependymoma</GlossaryTermRef> (n = 1). The distribution
of cancers among the 26 patients in the placebo group was as follows:
colorectal (n = 5), stomach (n = 3), kidney (n = 6), lung (n = 1), breast (n = 1), melanoma (n = 7), bile duct (n = 1), sarcoma (n = 1), and bladder (n = 1).
Twenty-four (73%) of the patients in the NDV treatment group had distant
metastases when they were recruited into the trial, compared with 22 (85%) of
the patients in the placebo group. Thirty-one (94%) of the patients in the NDV
treatment group received some form of conventional therapy (surgery,
chemotherapy, or radiation therapy) before the start of virus therapy; 9
(29%) of these patients were treated with more than one type of conventional
therapy. All (100%) of the patients in the placebo group received conventional
therapy before the start of virus therapy; 15 (58%) of these individuals were
treated with more than one type of conventional therapy. The average age of
the patients in the NDV treatment group was 62.6 years, compared with an
average age of 55.4 years for the patients in the placebo group. The two
groups, however, were well-balanced with respect to gender distribution (61%

each group, based on the following scale: 0 = free from complaints, 1 = capable of easy work, 2 = less than 50% bed rest required, 3 = more than 50%
bed rest required, 4 = 100% bedridden). Two complete responses and six partial
responses were reported for patients in the NDV treatment group, whereas no
responses were observed in the placebo group. In the NDV treatment group, ten
patients were reported to have stable disease, compared with just two patients
in the placebo group. In addition, more patients in the NDV treatment group
than in the placebo group reported subjective improvements in their 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef>. Twenty-two
(67%) of the patients in the NDV treatment group survived at least 1 year,
compared with 4 (15%) of the patients in the placebo group. The 2-year
survival proportions were 21% and 0% for patients in the NDV treatment group
and the placebo group, respectively.</Para><Para id="_106">This phase II trial had a number of weaknesses that could have influenced
its outcome. The most important weakness is the fact that the patients were
not randomly assigned to the two treatment groups. This lack of randomization
raises the possibility of 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044087">selection bias</GlossaryTermRef>. In this regard,
it is noteworthy that a larger percentage of patients in the NDV treatment
group than in the placebo group received conventional therapy within the 3
months preceding the initiation of NDV therapy (82% vs. 58%).<Reference refidx="39"/> In fact,
the average time between the completion of conventional therapy and the start
of NDV therapy among the patients who had a either a complete response or a
partial response was 1.8 months.<Reference refidx="39"/> Therefore, the contribution of NDV therapy
to the observed clinical outcomes is difficult to determine.</Para><Para id="_141">In a phase I trial that was conducted in the United States, another lytic NDV strain, PV701, was tested in patients with various advanced cancers.<Reference refidx="44"/> In this trial, 79 patients whose tumors had not responded to conventional therapy were given intravenous injections of virus. Four different treatment regimens were evaluated as follows:</Para><OrderedList id="_142" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>A single dose of NDV given once every 28 days (17 patients).</ListItem><ListItem>A single dose of NDV given 3 times during a 1-week period, repeated every 28 days (13 patients).</ListItem><ListItem>Three injections of NDV given during a 1-week period, with the first injection containing a lower dose of virus than the remaining 2, repeated every 28 days (37 patients).</ListItem><ListItem>Six injections of NDV given during a 2-week period, with the first injection containing a lower dose of virus than the remaining 5, repeated every 21 days (12 patients).</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_143">The researchers found that the use of lower initial doses of virus allowed the administration of higher subsequent doses. A complete response was reported for one patient, and partial tumor regression was observed in eight patients. Thirteen patients had stable disease for periods of time that lasted from 4 months to more than 30 months. Five patients died during the trial: four due to progressive disease and one  due, possibly, to a treatment-related complication (refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062978#_116" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/ndv-pdq">Adverse Effects</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information). Several patients experienced significant adverse side effects from NDV treatment, including fever, fatigue, dehydration, low blood pressure, shortness of breath, and hypoxia. Some patients who experienced these adverse effects required hospitalization. The researchers who conducted this trial have indicated that additional clinical studies are under way.</Para><Para id="_108">A major concern about the effectiveness of treating cancer patients by
repeated administration of a lytic strain of NDV is the possibility that the
immune system will produce virus-neutralizing antibodies. Virus-neutralizing
antibodies would prevent NDV from reaching and infecting malignant cells,
thereby blocking oncolysis. Impairment of NDV infection would also limit the
ability of cytotoxic T cells that target virus antigens to kill virus-infected
cancer cells. In addition, limiting the infection of cancer cells would lessen
the likelihood that the immune system would become trained to better recognize 
tumor-specific antigens. The Hungarian investigators have shown that anti-NDV
antibodies are produced in MTH-68-treated patients,<Reference refidx="38"/> but they apparently
have not determined whether these antibodies are virus-neutralizing. However,
the recent observation that 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044598">immune system tolerance</GlossaryTermRef> 
to viruses can be induced by repeated <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044068">oral</GlossaryTermRef> administration of virus proteins suggests
that the concern about virus-neutralizing antibodies may not be entirely
warranted.<Reference refidx="68"/> <Reference refidx="69"/> It is conceivable that frequent inhalation (or
injection) of NDV may lead to immune system tolerance of this virus. This
possibility should be explored in future studies.</Para><Table id="_195">
