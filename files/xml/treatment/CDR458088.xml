The use of acupuncture is part of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449722">traditional Chinese medicine</GlossaryTermRef> (TCM). TCM is a medical system that has been used for thousands of years to prevent, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046450">diagnose</GlossaryTermRef>, and treat disease. </Para><Para id="_4">Acupuncture is based on the belief that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454782">qi</GlossaryTermRef> (vital energy) flows through the body along a network of paths, called <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449744">meridians</GlossaryTermRef>. Qi is said to affect a person’s <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000441265">spiritual</GlossaryTermRef>, emotional, mental, and physical <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000651193">condition</GlossaryTermRef>. According to TCM, qi has two forces, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454787">yin and yang</GlossaryTermRef>. Yin and yang are opposite forces that work together to form a whole. The forces of yin and yang depend on each other and are made from each other in an unending cycle, such as hot and cold, day and night, and health and disease. Nothing is ever all yin or all yang, both exist in all things, including people. Many of the major <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000257523">organs</GlossaryTermRef> of the body are believed to be yin-yang pairs that must be in balance to be  healthy. When a person's yin and yang are not in balance, qi can become blocked. Blocked qi causes pain, illness, or other health problems. TCM uses acupuncture, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044660">diet</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463714">herbal</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044737">therapy</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000730354">meditation,</GlossaryTermRef> physical exercise, and massage to restore health by unblocking qi and correcting the balance of yin and yang within the person.</Para><Para id="_72">Most <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000613192">acupuncturists</GlossaryTermRef> in the United States practice acupuncture according to the  traditions of Chinese <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000482419">medicine</GlossaryTermRef>.

Acupoints are places where the meridians come to the surface of the body. There are more than 360 acupoints on the human body, with specific acupoints for each condition being treated.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_73"><Question>What physical effects may acupuncture have when used in cancer patients?</Question><Answer><Para id="_74">Acupuncture may cause physical responses in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000269443">nerve cells</GlossaryTermRef>, the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046229">pituitary gland</GlossaryTermRef>, and parts of the brain. These responses can cause the body to release <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046092">proteins</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045713">hormones</GlossaryTermRef>, and brain chemicals that control a number of   body functions. It is proposed that, in this way, acupuncture affects <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462668">blood pressure</GlossaryTermRef> and body temperature,   boosts <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356">immune system</GlossaryTermRef> activity,  and  causes the body's natural painkillers, such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449772">endorphins</GlossaryTermRef>,  to be released.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_55"><Question>How is acupuncture administered?</Question><Answer><Para id="_28">The acupuncture method most well-known uses needles. Disposable, stainless steel needles that are slightly thicker than a human hair are inserted into the skin at acupoints.

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_2"><Title>General CAM Information</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_3">Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also referred to as integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_4">Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_5">Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. </Para></SummarySection> 
  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_6"><Title>Evaluation of CAM Approaches</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_7">It is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute  and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_8">Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH)  in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.</Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_9"><ExternalRef xref="http://cam.cancer.gov/cam/best_case_intro.html">The NCI Best Case Series Program</ExternalRef>   which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.</Para></SummarySection>
