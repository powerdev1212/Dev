It is estimated that 74,000 new cases of bladder cancer  are expected to occur in the United States in 
2015.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_75">Bladder cancer is diagnosed  almost twice as often in whites as in blacks of
either sex.  The incidence of bladder cancer among other ethnic and racial
groups in the United States falls between that of blacks and whites.  The
incidence of bladder cancer increases with age.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_76">Since the 1950s, the incidence of bladder cancer has risen by approximately 50%. It is to be anticipated that, with the aging of the U.S. population, this trend will continue. There has been a decrease of approximately 33% in bladder cancer mortality during the same interval (National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, 1973–1997). It is estimated that   16,000 Americans will die of bladder cancer in 2015.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_77">The age-adjusted mortality from bladder cancer has decreased in all races and sexes during the past 30 years.<Reference refidx="3"/> These changes may reflect earlier diagnosis, better therapy, less exposure to carcinogens, or some combination of these factors. </Para><Para id="_78">More than 90% of  cancers in the bladder are transitional cell carcinomas (TCC), also called urothelial cancer.  Other important histologic types include squamous cell carcinoma SCC and adenocarcinoma. Urothelial cancer can also rarely develop in the  lining of the renal pelvis, ureter, prostate, and urethra.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_11"><Title>Risk Factors</Title><Para id="_79">There are no definitive studies on the prevention of bladder or other urothelial cancers. Reduction in environmental and occupational exposures would presumably reduce urothelial cancer risk. Differences in age, gender, race, and geographic distribution may reflect differences in environmental and occupational exposure to possible toxicants. Relevant exposures include chemical exposures; cigarette smoking; infection with bacteria, parasitic fungi, or viruses; and treatment with certain chemotherapeutic agents. A positive family history of bladder cancer has also been associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/> </Para><Para id="_80">Several populations with a variety of exposures appear to be at higher risk of developing bladder cancer. By far, the greatest known environmental risk factor in the general population is tobacco, especially cigarette smoking;<Reference refidx="4"/> individuals who smoke have a fourfold to sevenfold increased risk of developing bladder cancer than individuals who have never smoked.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> Risk is reduced with cessation of smoking, but a relatively small decrease in incidence is seen for the first 5 to 7 years after cessation. Even after 10 years, the risk of an individual developing bladder cancer is still almost twice that of an individual who has never smoked.</Para><Para id="_13">Among the chemicals implicated in smoking-induced bladder cancer are
aminobiphenyl and its metabolites.<Reference refidx="4"/>  It is possible that inherited and 
inducible enzymes are important in the activation and detoxification of
aminobiphenyls and other putative bladder carcinogens.  These enzymes include
N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2),<Reference refidx="9"/> cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYT 1A2),<Reference refidx="10"/> and
glutathione S-transferase M 1.<Reference refidx="11"/>  Several studies have indicated that
specific genotypes and phenotypes of these enzymes and their activities,
particularly in the liver and urothelium, are associated with susceptibility to
smoking-induced bladder cancer and bladder cancer induced by other aryl amines,
particularly in industrially exposed populations.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/>  Not all of these
studies, however, have been well controlled for active or former smoking
histories.</Para><Para id="_14">A variety of industrial exposures have also been implicated as risk factors for
developing bladder cancer, primarily aromatic amines, such as 2-naphthylamine, beta-naphthylamine, or 4-chloro-o-toluidine, present in the production
of dyes and benzidine and its derivatives;<Reference refidx="4"/>  possibly chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons;<Reference refidx="16"/> chlorination by-products
in treated water;<Reference refidx="17"/> aluminum production (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, fluorides);<Reference refidx="4"/> and certain aldehydes.<Reference refidx="18"/>
</Para><Para id="_15">Occupations reported to be associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer
include those that involve processing paint, dye, metal, and petroleum products.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="19"/>
</Para><Para id="_86">It is estimated that 5% to 15% of patients in the United States who eventually die from bladder cancer will have strong exposure histories to the above-named environmental factors (other than smoking).<Reference refidx="20"/></Para><Para id="_81">The use of contaminated Chinese herbs is also reported to be a risk factor.  The prime carcinogen in these herbs appears to be aristolochic acid (AA) extracted from species of <ScientificName>Aristolochia</ScientificName>.<Reference refidx="21"/> Because of the diversity of  Chinese herbal regimens used in addition to AA, other unidentified phytotoxins may also play a role.<Reference refidx="22"/> The chronic nephropathy associated with ingestion of herbs contaminated with <ScientificName>A. fangchi</ScientificName> has been linked to urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis and ureter. Herbs with <ScientificName>A. fangchi</ScientificName> are banned from Belgium, Canada, Australia, and Germany but are still available in the United States.<Reference refidx="23"/></Para><Para id="_82">Ingestion of large quantities of arsenic in well water has also been associated with numerous malignancies, including TCC of the bladder.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/> Similar endemic pockets of bladder cancer are found in other regions with high arsenic concentrations in drinking water.<Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/> In South Taiwan, arsenic blackfoot disease is endemic. Exposure to inorganic arsenic compounds, such as gallium arsenide, is also associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer.</Para><Para id="_83">Additional risk factors  associated with more aggressive forms of bladder cancer include   neuropathic bladder and associated indwelling catheters;<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/>   <ScientificName>Schistosoma haematobium</ScientificName> bladder infections (Bilharzial bladder cancer);<Reference refidx="28"/> exposure to the cancer chemotherapy agent cyclophosphamide <Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/> and perhaps other alkylating agents, such as ifosfamide (although the use of mesna in conjunction with these agents may reduce the incidence);<Reference refidx="29"/> and pelvic radiation therapy for other malignancies, such as prostate cancer,<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/> uterine cancer,<Reference refidx="33"/> and cervical cancer.<Reference refidx="34"/></Para><Para id="_146">Specific genetic mutations associated with bladder cancer include the following:<Reference refidx="35"/><Reference refidx="36"/><Reference refidx="37"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_147" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>	<GeneName>HRAS</GeneName> mutation (Costello syndrome or Faciocutaneoskeletal syndrome).</ListItem><ListItem><GeneName>RB1</GeneName> mutation.</ListItem><ListItem><GeneName>PTEN</GeneName>/<GeneName>MMAC1</GeneName> mutation (Cowden syndrome).</ListItem><ListItem><GeneName>NAT2</GeneName> slow acetylator phenotype.</ListItem><ListItem><GeneName>GSTM1</GeneName> null phenotype.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_84">Urothelial tumors other than TCC include adenocarcinoma, SCC, and metastatic adenocarcinoma.  Risks for squamous cell tumors in the bladder include indwelling catheters <Reference refidx="38"/><Reference refidx="39"/> and <ScientificName>S. haematobium</ScientificName> cystitis.
</Para><Para id="_85">Adenocarcinomas account for less than 2% of primary bladder cancers, including metastases from the rectum, stomach, endometrium, breast, prostate, and ovary.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_18"><Title>Inheritance</Title><Para id="_19">Although occasional familial clusters have been anecdotally reported <Reference refidx="40"/><Reference refidx="41"/><Reference refidx="42"/>
and bladder cancer (as well as upper urinary  tract  TCC) is part
of the Lynch family cancer syndrome II,<Reference refidx="43"/> there is no evidence that 
tendencies towards developing bladder cancer are inherited.<Reference refidx="44"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_20"><Title>Clinical Presentation</Title><Para id="_21">Seventy percent of patients with bladder cancer have superficial disease at presentation.<Reference refidx="45"/>  Hematuria is the most common presenting sign, occurring in about 90% of cases. Hematuria may be intermittent, so a urinalysis without red blood cells does not exclude a diagnosis of urothelial cancer. In patients  with macroscopic hematuria, the reported rates of bladder cancer range from 13% to 34.5%.<Reference refidx="46"/><Reference refidx="47"/><Reference refidx="48"/> Other presenting symptoms include dysuria, urinary frequency or urgency, and less commonly, flank pain secondary to obstruction, and pain from pelvic invasion or bone metastases. Diagnosis and staging usually begin with cystoscopy. Full evaluation of the upper and lower urinary tract is required.<Reference refidx="49"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_22"><Title>Histopathology</Title><Para id="_23">More than 90% of bladder cancers diagnosed in the United States are pure
TCCs or TCCs mixed with other histologies,
primarily SCC, adenocarcinoma, or both.  An additional 3%
to 4% are pure SCCs, which are approximately twice as
likely to occur in women as in men.  SCCs also represent a
greater proportion of bladder cancers occurring in individuals who have
<ScientificName>S.  haematobium</ScientificName> infections of the bladder or who have histories of
long-term indwelling urinary catheters, bladder stones, or recurrent bladder
infections.<Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="38"/><Reference refidx="39"/></Para><Para id="_24">Both the grade and stage at diagnosis of TCC have extremely important
prognostic and therapeutic implications.  Nontransitional cell histologies,
however, all behave very aggressively and are less responsive to
treatments other than extirpative surgery.<Reference refidx="5"/>  The prognosis of
patients and the choice of treatments depend on the aggressiveness and grade of
the tumor.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_44"><Title>Grade and Stage of Newly Diagnosed Bladder Cancer in an Unscreened Population</Title><Para id="_45">The critical nature of the histologic grade and stage of index lesions
for individual prognosis and management decisions has been well recognized for
many years.  In a study that attempted to evaluate grade and stage in newly diagnosed bladder tumors in a population-based setting, 89% of all newly diagnosed bladder cancers in men aged 50 years and
older reported to the state of Wisconsin tumor registry in calendar year 1988 
had blocks and slides reviewed by a single pathologist who did not know the
original diagnosis.<Reference refidx="50"/>  Fifty-seven percent of specimens were grade I or II, stage
Ta or T1 TCCs; 19% were grade III, stage Ta or T1 (or Tis) TCCs; and 24% were
muscularis propria invading or deeper (stage T2+), almost all of which were
grade III lesions or of nontransitional cell histologies.  Because of
Wisconsin’s small population of black males aged 50 years and older (fewer than
3% of all bladder cancers occurred in nonwhites),<Reference refidx="51"/> differences in grade and
stage at presentation between blacks and whites could not be determined.
Similarly, this study did not look at females or at males younger than 50
years.      Because of
variability in histologic interpretations of bladder cancers recorded by
tumor registries,<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="52"/> the presenting grade and stage of this malignancy in
Wisconsin is known only for males aged 50 years and older.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_111"><Para id="_112">Almost all bladder malignancies originate on the uroepithelial surface.  The
majority of patients who die from bladder cancer do so from metastatic disease;
treatment for metastatic bladder cancer is rarely, if ever, curative.<Reference refidx="53"/>  The
overwhelming majority of patients with metastases have concomitant or prior
muscularis propria (stage T2+) invading lesions.<Reference refidx="54"/>  Seventy percent to 90% of
patients with muscularis propria invading bladder cancer present with this
diagnosis, however,<Reference refidx="55"/><Reference refidx="56"/>  do not come from the much larger pool of patients
with recurring superficial TCCs.  The goal of
screening is the early detection of bladder cancer that is destined to become
muscle invading.  Although one study reports that approximately 30% of patients
with superficial TCC followed for 20 years will eventually die from this
disease,<Reference refidx="57"/> these data remain unconfirmed, are at odds with other reports,<Reference refidx="58"/>
and may reflect outmoded patterns of diagnosis, classification, and management. </Para><Para id="_113">Because bladder cancer is almost never incidentally found at autopsy, the
preclinical duration in which it has not yet caused symptoms, but in which it
can be detected by cystoscopy, is probably brief.  This rapid growth rate is
supported by clinical experience <Reference refidx="59"/> and implies that screening would have to
be performed at frequent intervals.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_114"><Title>Screening Methods</Title><SummarySection id="_116"><Title>Cystoscopy and cytology</Title><Para id="_117">The use of cystoscopies and bladder wash/urinary cytologic examinations has
proven quite successful in the surveillance and management of patients with
previously treated bladder cancers.<Reference refidx="60"/>  These means are not practical in individuals without a history of bladder cancer
because of expense and morbidity.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_118"><Title>Hematuria</Title><Para id="_119">Although hematuria is the most common presenting sign of bladder cancer, most individuals with hematuria do not have bladder cancer. In the general population, the prevalence of asymptomatic gross hematuria is about 2.5%, while the prevalence of asymptomatic microhematuria is about 13%.<Reference refidx="61"/> In a recent prospective analysis of patients attending a hematuria clinic in the United Kingdom, 183 (19.2%) of the 948 patients with gross hematuria were found to have bladder cancer on cystoscopy.<Reference refidx="48"/>  However, only 47 (4.8%) of the 982 patients with microhematuria were found to have bladder cancer.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_120"><Title>One-time hematuria testing</Title><Para id="_121">Two groups have reported on the use of testing a single urine specimen for
blood to detect urologic malignancies, serious urinary tract diseases, and
bladder cancers.  Both studies were performed retrospectively to ascertain
information from patients who were seen at a large multispecialty clinic <Reference refidx="61"/> or
who subscribed to a large health maintenance organization (HMO) and were tested
in a multiphasic screening.<Reference refidx="62"/>  Because of the retrospective nature of each
study, neither was designed to specifically look for bladder cancer detection
or to focus on the population at highest risk (men aged 50 years and older). 
Both studies concluded that single hematuria testing was not effective in
diagnosing bladder cancer.  A longer follow-up of the HMO study indicated that
individuals with microhematuria were at a higher risk for subsequent
development of muscle-invading bladder cancer, with a latency of 3.5 to 14.5
years.<Reference refidx="63"/>  There is insufficient evidence to indicate that single hematuria
testing is effective in screening for bladder cancer, and there is no evidence
that single hematuria testing results in reduced mortality from the disease.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_122"><Title>Repetitive hematuria testing</Title><Para id="_123">Two studies using Ames Hemastix, a chemical reagent strip for hemoglobin that
correlates with microscopic urinalysis in detecting hematuria,<Reference refidx="64"/> were
conducted in geographically defined (Madison, Wisconsin and Leeds, England)
populations of middle-aged and elderly men using repetitive home reagent strip
testing.  In each program,  patients were solicited from patient care
registries.  Men with histories of previous urologic malignancies, or known
causes of hematuria, or who were noncompliant were eliminated.  In the four studies
performed (one pilot study and one larger study at each site), 45% to 55% of
solicited individuals took part.  In these studies, 1.2% to 1.3% of all
participants were found to have bladder cancer (all TCC).  Only 1 of the 21
patients in the first study <Reference refidx="50"/><Reference refidx="59"/><Reference refidx="64"/> and none of the 26 detected in the second
study had stage T2 or greater malignancy.  As a limitation of repetitive
hematuria screening in a general population of men aged 50 years and older,
more than 90% of individuals with positive tests upon initial work up were
found not to have bladder cancer.<Reference refidx="64"/>  In the Wisconsin hematuria screening
studies, all patients who were hematuria positive with negative work ups or who
were found to have no serious disease were followed for at least 24 months,
with no findings of developing bladder cancer.  Similarly, at least 18 months
after their last testing, no screening participant (with or without hematuria)
had died of bladder cancer.  It is possible that longer follow-up is necessary
to prove that these participants did not have bladder cancer;<Reference refidx="63"/> however, such studies
are not available.  The relatively low positive predictive value of
repetitive hematuria testing (7.6% for bladder cancer and 11.6% for all
malignancies) <Reference refidx="50"/><Reference refidx="64"/><Reference refidx="65"/> raises questions about the practicality of this mode of
screening.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_134"><Title>Other possible screening modalities</Title><Para id="_135">The accuracy of voided urine cytology in detecting bladder cancer has been
evaluated primarily in patients with histories of bladder cancer who are
undergoing cystoscopic surveillance or as a routine test performed in all
patients attending a large urology office in a multispecialty clinic.  In the 
studies of patients with histories of bladder cancer, voided urinary cytology 
was effective in diagnosing 20% to 40% of grade I TCCs, 20% to 50% of grade II
malignancies, and 60% to 80% of grade III/Tis cancers.<Reference refidx="66"/><Reference refidx="67"/>  Although such
studies were not performed in patients without either hematuria or histories of
recurrent bladder tumors, a major concern for screening purposes is the lack of
sensitivity for well-differentiated and moderately differentiated TCCs and the
large proportion of specimens in which an insufficient number of cells were
present for any cytologic diagnosis to be offered.  Although false-positive
results were exceedingly rare, the lack of sensitivity even in this highly suspect
population make voided urine cytology an inappropriate test for screening the
general population.  No studies have looked at outcome of cytologic screening
on disease-related mortality in a non–industrially exposed population.  Outcomes
of patients screened at the urology clinic are also not available.<Reference refidx="66"/></Para><Para id="_136">The outcomes of men diagnosed with bladder cancer through a hematuria home screening
program using a chemical reagent strip were compared with a statewide population-based sample of 87% of all men aged 50 years and older         from the
Wisconsin tumor registry.<Reference refidx="50"/>  Histologic sections were blindly reviewed,
and   similar proportions of low-grade superficial versus high-grade or invasive cases were found;  the proportion of late-stage (T2 or higher) disease was lower in the screened patients. At  14 years, 20.4% of tumor
registry patients had died from bladder cancer (including 50% of those with muscle-invading grade III lesions); however, at 14 years of follow-up, no participant with bladder cancer detected by screening
had died of bladder cancer.  Whether these differences resulted from some combination of
lead-time effect, overdiagnosis, or selection biases, a real screening effect cannot be determined.</Para><Para id="_137">The measurement of a variety of molecules and cellular elements screened in urine has been proposed, and in some cases marketed, to monitor previously diagnosed bladder cancer patients; however, the specificity and sensitivity of these markers have not been assessed in a screening setting in a general population, but several such studies are under way.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_127"><Title>Special Populations</Title><Para id="_128">In populations at particularly high risk for developing bladder cancer (other
than those with histories of bladder cancer), few screening studies that have
assessed bladder cancer mortality have been published.<Reference refidx="68"/><Reference refidx="69"/><Reference refidx="70"/><Reference refidx="71"/>  A study of
annual cytology in aluminum workers exposed to coal tar pitch in Quebec showed
a nearly 40% reduction in bladder cancer case-fatality 6 years after diagnosis,
compared with a historical control group of workers from the same plants who were
not screened;<Reference refidx="72"/> the difference, however, was not statistically significant. 
Awareness of adverse outcome in the unscreened predecessors may have influenced
participation in the program and workers’ awareness of symptoms, the
willingness of workers and physicians to initiate diagnostic investigations
based on signs and symptoms, and the compliance of workers with medical
recommendations for evaluation and treatment.  The brief duration of follow-up
in the screened group may have artifactually improved the outcome.</Para><Para id="_129">No randomized controlled bladder cancer screening trials have been conducted in
environmentally or industrially exposed cohorts.  Completed studies have
usually not had comparable control groups, have not been of sufficient sample
size to show an effect on outcome, and have been of insufficient length to show
a mortality benefit (or lack thereof) for the modality  or modalities being
assessed.<Reference refidx="69"/><Reference refidx="70"/> 
 One study described the usefulness of measuring three biomarkers in voided urine for risk assessment and cancer detection in a large cohort of Chinese workers at increased risk of bladder cancer.<Reference refidx="73"/> The workers were individually stratified, screened, monitored, and diagnosed on the basis of predefined molecular biomarker profiles.    These techniques remain investigational.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">American Cancer Society: Cancer Facts and Figures 2015.
