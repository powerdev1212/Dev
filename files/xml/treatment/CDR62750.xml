Its incidence appears to be increasing in some <Reference refidx="1"/> but not all <Reference refidx="2"/> areas of the United States.  Overall U.S. incidence rates have likely been increasing for a number of years.<Reference refidx="3"/>  At least some of this increase may be attributable to increasing skin cancer awareness and resulting increasing investigation and biopsy of skin lesions.   A precise estimate of the total number and incidence rate of nonmelanoma skin cancer is not possible, because reporting to cancer registries is not required.  However, based on Medicare fee-for-service data extrapolated to the U.S. population, it has been estimated that the total number of persons treated for nonmelanoma skin cancers in 2006 was about 3,500,000.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/>  That number would exceed all other cases of cancer estimated by the American Cancer Society for that year,  which was about 1.4 million.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_73">Melanoma is a reportable cancer in U.S. cancer registries, so there are more reliable estimates of incidence than is the case with nonmelanoma skin cancers.  In 2015, it is estimated that 73,870 individuals in the United States will be diagnosed with melanoma and approximately 9,940 will die of it.  The incidence of melanoma has been increasing for at least 30 years.<Reference refidx="6"/> From 2007 to 2011, incidence rates were
stable in men and women younger than 50 years but increased by
2.6% per year in women aged 50 years and older. Mortality rates decreased by
2.6% per year in individuals younger than 50 years but increased by
0.6% per year among those aged 50 years and older.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_74">A study of skin biopsy rates in relation to melanoma incidence rates obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) of the National Cancer Institute indicated that much of the observed increase in incidence between 1986 and 2001 was confined to local disease and was most likely caused by overdiagnosis as a result of increased skin biopsy rates during this period.<Reference refidx="7"/> Between 1998 and 2007, a 2.5% relative yearly incidence increase in pediatric melanoma was observed in SEER databases. During that time, the average annual incidence in this group was exceptionally low, however (5.4 per 1 million), and may have resulted in spurious trends; nevertheless, similar trends have been seen in Sweden.<Reference refidx="8"/> In the U.S. study of pediatric melanoma, nearly one-half of the patients had local disease (22% of patients had <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> disease and 25% of patients had superficial spreading), and nearly one-half of the patients had disease with a thickness of less than one millimeter. Given that mortality from pediatric melanoma had been fairly stable during  those years,<Reference refidx="9"/> it is likely that the increase in incidence could be explained, at least in part, by overdiagnosis.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_9"><Title>Risk Factors</Title><Para id="_75">Epidemiologic evidence suggests that exposure to UV radiation and the sensitivity of an individual’s skin to UV radiation are risk factors for skin cancer, although the type of exposure (high-intensity and short-duration vs. chronic exposure) and pattern of exposure (continuous vs. intermittent) may differ among the three main types of skin cancer.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/>   In addition, the immune system may play a role in pathogenesis of skin cancers.  Organ-transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive drugs are at elevated risk of skin cancers, particularly squamous cell cancers (SCC).  Arsenic exposure also increases the risk of cutaneous SCC.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/></Para><Para id="_10">The incidence of melanoma rises rapidly in Caucasians after age 20 years.  Fair-skinned individuals exposed to the sun are at higher risk.    Individuals with certain types of pigmented lesions
(dysplastic or atypical nevi), with several large nondysplastic nevi, with
many small nevi, or with moderate freckling have a twofold to threefold increased  risk of
developing melanoma.<Reference refidx="15"/> Individuals with familial dysplastic nevus syndrome
or with several dysplastic or atypical nevi are at high (&gt;fivefold) risk of
developing melanoma.<Reference refidx="15"/>
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_86"><Title>Accuracy of Making a Clinical Diagnosis of Melanoma</Title><Para id="_78">A systematic review of 32 studies that compared the accuracy of dermatologists and primary care physicians in making a clinical diagnosis of melanoma concluded that there was no statistically significant difference in accuracy.  However, the results were inconclusive, owing to small sample sizes and study design weaknesses.<Reference refidx="16"/>   In addition, differentiating between benign and malignant melanocytic tumors during histologic examination of biopsy specimens has been shown to be  inconsistent even in the hands of experienced dermatopathologists.<Reference refidx="17"/> This fact undermines results of studies examining screening effectiveness and also may undermine the effectiveness of any screening intervention. Furthermore, this suggests that requesting a second opinion regarding the pathology of biopsy specimens may be important.<Reference refidx="17"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_81"><Title>Evidence of Benefit Associated With Screening</Title><Para id="_82">More than 90% of melanomas that arise in the skin can be recognized with the naked
eye.  Very often there is a prolonged horizontal growth phase during which
time the tumor expands centrifugally beneath the epidermis but does not invade
the underlying dermis.  This horizontal growth phase may  provide lead time for
early detection.  Melanoma is more easily cured  if treated before the onset of the
vertical growth phase with its metastatic potential.<Reference refidx="18"/></Para><Para id="_83">The probability of tumor recurrence within 10 years after curative resection  is less than 10% with tumors
less than 1.4 mm in thickness.  For patients with tumors less than 0.76 mm in
thickness, the likelihood of recurrence is less than 1% in 10 years.<Reference refidx="19"/></Para><Para id="_76">A systematic review of skin cancer screening examined evidence available through mid-2005 and concluded that direct evidence of improved health outcomes associated with skin cancer screening is lacking.<Reference refidx="20"/></Para><Para id="_89">However, this does not mean that skin cancers (whether melanoma or nonmelanoma) are unimportant or can be neglected without adverse consequences. When neglected, skin cancers can be  disfiguring and/or cause death. Skin cancers are easily detected clinically and are often cured by excisional biopsy alone.</Para><Para id="_85">Various observational studies exploring the possibility that melanoma screening
may be effective have been reported.  An educational campaign in
western Scotland, promoting awareness of the signs of suspicious skin lesions
and encouraging early self-referral,    showed  a
decrease in mortality rates associated with the campaign.<Reference refidx="21"/>   
 In northern Germany, one region that received a skin cancer screening program during 2003 and 2004 was compared with four nearby regions that received no skin cancer screening program.<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/>  The two-stage skin cancer screening program began with a total-body visual examination of the skin by a general practitioner; if skin cancer was suspected, the patient was re-examined by a dermatologist.  Nineteen percent of all those eligible were screened.  The melanoma mortality rates were decreased in the years after the screening program in the screened region (1.7 per 100,000 in 1998–1999 to 0.9 per 100,000 in 2008–2009), whereas the melanoma mortality rates either stayed the same or increased in the comparison regions.  Because of numerous methodological limitations such as the lack of randomization, lack of an internal control group,  and relying on the region-level data rather than individual-level data to assess outcomes, these data provide only very weak evidence that the screening program reduced mortality from melanoma.  Further, a thorough consideration of the harms was not provided, such as the harms associated with false-positive tests and overdiagnosis.  (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062750#_92" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-screening-pdq">Evidence of Harm Associated With Screening</SummaryRef> section in the  <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062750#_6" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-screening-pdq">Description of the Evidence</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information.) Of note, four out of five skin lesions excised in the screening program were found to be benign.<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/></Para><Para id="_77">A population-based trial using cluster randomization to determine the effect of skin screening on melanoma mortality was initiated in Queensland, Australia.<Reference refidx="24"/>  Intervention communities were randomly assigned to receive a 3-year program targeting adults older than age 30 years.  The program consisted of:</Para><ItemizedList id="_79" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Community education and promotion of self-screening.</ListItem><ListItem>General practitioner education about screening and training in the diagnosis of melanoma.</ListItem><ListItem>Free skin cancer screening clinics.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_80">Matched control communities received usual care. Originally designed to include 44 matched communities followed for 15 years, the trial lost its funding after its initial pilot phase in 18 communities (population 63,035).<Reference refidx="25"/> Although the pilot phase established feasibility of community-based programs, no health outcomes were reported.  In the study, 16,383 whole-body skin examinations were reported in the intervention communities, resulting in a referral rate of 14.1% (18.2% for people aged 50 years or older).  Thirty-three melanomas were diagnosed, 13 of which were <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis>.  The estimated specificity for melanoma was 86.1%, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 2.5%.  The PPVs for squamous cell and for basal cell cancers were 7.2% and 19.3%, respectively.  Negative screens were not followed up, and the sensitivity of skin examination was not reported.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_92"><Title>Evidence of Harm Associated With Screening</Title><Para id="_93">Harms have not been well studied or reported in quantitative terms.  However, visual examination of the skin in asymptomatic individuals may lead to unavoidable adverse consequences. These include complications of diagnostic or treatment interventions (including extensive surgery) and the psychological effects of being labeled with a potentially fatal disease. Another harmful consequence is overdiagnosis leading to the detection of biologically benign disease that would otherwise go undetected and the possibility of misdiagnosis of a benign lesion as malignant.
