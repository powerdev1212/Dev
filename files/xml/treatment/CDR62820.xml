tissue should be obtained via either core-needle or incisional biopsy for
microscopic examination to determine histologic type and tumor grade.  Careful
planning of the initial biopsy is important to avoid compromising subsequent
curative resection.  Since the selection of treatment is determined by the
grade of the tumor, it is essential to have a careful review of the biopsy
tissue by a pathologist who is experienced in diagnosing sarcomas.  Complete
staging and treatment planning by a multidisciplinary team of cancer
specialists is required to determine the optimal treatment for patients with this
disease. </Para><Para id="_262">There is evidence that at least some favorable clinical outcomes may be associated with referral to a specialized sarcoma treatment center.

soft tissue sarcoma.  Clinical staging involves magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)  or computed tomography (CT) of the primary tumor area and a chest CT to look for metastasis to the lung (the most common site of distant spread).  An abdominal CT scan is done in the case of retroperitoneal sarcomas because the liver may be the site of initial clinical metastasis for these tumors.  </Para><Para id="_195">The stage is determined by the size of the tumor, the
histologic grade, and whether there is spread to lymph nodes or distant sites. 
Intracompartmental or extracompartmental extension of extremity sarcomas is
also important for surgical decision making.  For complete staging, a thorough
review of all
biopsy specimens (including those from the primary tumor, lymph nodes, or other
suspicious lesions) is essential.  CT scan of the chest is
recommended for sarcomas  larger than 5 cm (T2) or with moderate to
poor differentiation (grades 2–4).  Nodal involvement is rare, occurring in
less than 3% of patients with sarcoma.<Reference refidx="1"/> </Para><Para id="_352">Lymph node involvement in soft tissue sarcomas of adulthood is rare but is somewhat more frequent in some subtypes (e.g., rhabdomyosarcoma, vascular sarcomas, clear cell sarcomas, and epithelioid sarcomas) when they are high grade.<Reference refidx="2"/>  Because treatment decisions are predicated on pathology staging, patients should be staged before, and again after, any neoadjuvant therapy.  The assessment of tumor grade can be affected in either direction, but more frequently decreased because of  differential cellular loss related to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Grade, which is based on cellular differentiation, mitotic rate, and extent of necrosis, should be recorded for all soft tissue sarcomas.  A three-grade system (G1–G3) is preferred.
