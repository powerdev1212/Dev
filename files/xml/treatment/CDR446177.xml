More than 400 hydrazine-related compounds have been tested for their ability to kill cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046476">cells</GlossaryTermRef>. One of these compounds, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045378">procarbazine</GlossaryTermRef>, has been used to treat <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045012">Hodgkin disease</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045135">melanoma</GlossaryTermRef>, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000445043">lung cancer</GlossaryTermRef> since the 1960s.</Para><Para id="_9">In view of procarbazine’s anticancer activity, hydrazine sulfate (a compound similar to procarbazine) was studied for its effectiveness in fighting cancer beginning in the 1970s. Studies of hydrazine sulfate as a treatment for cancer-related cachexia also began during this time.</Para><Para id="_10">Hydrazine compounds have also been used to make rocket fuel, as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044112">herbicides</GlossaryTermRef> (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000643008">chemicals</GlossaryTermRef> that kill plants), and as chemical agents in boiler and cooling-tower water systems. Many <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044724">scientists</GlossaryTermRef> consider hydrazine sulfate and other similar substances to be cancer-causing agents and are concerned about the safety of using these compounds. </Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_29"><Question>What is the theory behind the claim that hydrazine sulfate is useful in treating cancer?</Question><Answer><Para id="_12">Two theories have been suggested to explain how hydrazine sulfate acts against cancer and cachexia:</Para><ItemizedList id="_35" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Hydrazine sulfate may prevent the body from making sugar that cancer cells need to grow. It has been suggested that cachexia occurs because the cancer is using too much of the body's sugar, preventing healthy cells from getting what they need to live. This causes <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissues</GlossaryTermRef> to die and muscle to waste away, and the patient loses weight.  </ListItem><ListItem> Hydrazine sulfate may block <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045290">tumor necrosis factor-alpha</GlossaryTermRef> (TNF-alpha). This is a substance made by the body’s <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045993">white blood cells</GlossaryTermRef> to fight <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045364">infection</GlossaryTermRef> and tissue damage. High levels of TNF-alpha have been found in cancer patients. These high levels of TNF-alpha may cause loss of appetite, tiredness, and the breakdown of muscle tissue. As muscle breaks down, it makes sugar that the cancer cells use to grow.  Blocking the TNF-alpha might stop <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumor</GlossaryTermRef> growth and prevent cachexia. </ListItem></ItemizedList></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_30"><Question>How is hydrazine sulfate administered?</Question><Answer><Para id="_15">Hydrazine sulfate is taken by mouth in pills or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000455334">capsules</GlossaryTermRef>. There is no standard <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044664">dose</GlossaryTermRef> or length of treatment time. </Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_31"><Question>Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using hydrazine sulfate? </Question><Answer><Para id="_36">Research in a laboratory or using animals is done to find out if a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000348921">drug</GlossaryTermRef>, procedure, or treatment is likely to be safe and useful in humans. These <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044517">preclinical studies</GlossaryTermRef> are done before any testing in humans is begun. The following has been learned from preclinical studies of hydrazine sulfate:</Para><ItemizedList id="_37" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>In most studies with rats, mice, and hamsters, hydrazine sulfate caused an increase in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000270740">lung</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046312">liver</GlossaryTermRef>, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000304766">breast</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancers</GlossaryTermRef>.</ListItem><ListItem>When used alone against certain types of cancer (including <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045135">melanoma</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045343">leukemia</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000444968">bladder</GlossaryTermRef>, breast, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000445079">prostate</GlossaryTermRef>), hydrazine sulfate slowed tumor growth in some <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454774">animal studies</GlossaryTermRef> and showed no effect in others. In cases where  tumor growth was slowed the most, the animals lost large amounts of weight.  This finding does not support the proposed use of hydrazine sulfate to treat cachexia caused by cancer. </ListItem><ListItem>When hydrazine sulfate was combined with an anticancer drug, it seemed to improve the anticancer effects in rats and mice. When hydrazine sulfate was combined with an anticancer drug that affects the way cells use sugar, however, it helped in some studies and did not help in others.</ListItem><ListItem>Preclinical studies by   the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044266">National Cancer Institute</GlossaryTermRef> (NCI) found that hydrazine sulfate showed no anticancer activity except in one type of cancer in rats. The NCI decided not to continue studying the compound as a treatment for cancer. Studies of hydrazine sulfate as a treatment for cancer-related anorexia and cachexia continued. </ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_44">For more information on the preclinical studies, see the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044271">PDQ</GlossaryTermRef> health professional version of <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062975#_15" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/hydrazine-sulfate-pdq">Hydrazine Sulfate</SummaryRef>.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_32"><Question>Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) of hydrazine sulfate been conducted?</Question><Answer><Para id="_20"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045961">Clinical trials</GlossaryTermRef> are a type of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000651211">research study</GlossaryTermRef> that tests how well new drugs or other treatments work in people. There have been many studies of hydrazine sulfate in patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000478743">advanced cancer</GlossaryTermRef>. Researchers looked at the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_21" Style="bullet"><ListItem>	Tumor <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044085">response</GlossaryTermRef> and/or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044301">survival</GlossaryTermRef> among patients with various types of cancer.</ListItem><ListItem>Changes in body weight.</ListItem><ListItem><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417">Quality of life</GlossaryTermRef>.</ListItem><ListItem>Changes in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463734">nutritional status</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046173">metabolism</GlossaryTermRef> (chemical changes that take place in cells and make energy needed for life).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_22">Clinical trials of hydrazine sulfate have reported the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_23" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>In the mid 1970s, clinical trials by a drug company found that a small number of patients who were treated with hydrazine sulfate for advanced cancer reported having a better appetite, losing less weight,  feeling stronger, or having less pain. In some  patients, the tumor got smaller or did not grow, or there was improvement in a cancer-related <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045022">symptom</GlossaryTermRef>. These clinical trials do not prove that hydrazine sulfate is effective for advanced cancer, however, because of weaknesses in study design. There was no <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044149">control group</GlossaryTermRef> (a group of patients who did not receive hydrazine sulfate) and half of the patients in the trial could not be counted in the results for reasons that include missing information, short treatment times, and receiving other treatment along with the hydrazine sulfate. </ListItem><ListItem>From the 1970s to the mid 1990s, Russian studies with hydrazine sulfate had mixed results. Little information was reported about the patients and their treatment and about the study design and methods. All of the patients in these studies also received <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044930">standard treatment</GlossaryTermRef> with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045570">surgery</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045214">chemotherapy</GlossaryTermRef>, and/or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044971">radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef>. Therefore, it is not known if results were caused by hydrazine sulfate or one of the standard treatments, or both.</ListItem><ListItem> Clinical studies funded by the NCI in the 1970s found that hydrazine sulfate did not cause tumors to shrink or go away. Some patients reported small improvements in appetite, pain, and weight, but they did not last. These studies did not include control groups.</ListItem><ListItem>Four  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045858">randomized</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044014">controlled trials</GlossaryTermRef> were done in the 1990s. A randomized trial is a study in which the patients are assigned by chance to separate groups to compare different treatments; neither the researchers nor the patients can choose which group. These trials compared hydrazine sulfate with a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046688">placebo</GlossaryTermRef> (an inactive substance that looks like the treatment being tested). The results showed that hydrazine sulfate was not effective in treating cancer. In some cases, it was found to be harmful. <ItemizedList id="_38" Style="dash"><ListItem>In three of the trials, lung cancer patients received either hydrazine sulfate or a placebo, along with anticancer drugs. The patients who received  hydrazine sulfate did not live longer or have their tumors shrink any more than the placebo group. In one of the studies, patients who took hydrazine sulfate showed better <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463734">nutritional status</GlossaryTermRef> than patients in the placebo group, although the increase in body weight was small. In another of the studies, patients who received hydrazine sulfate had a worse quality of life than patients who received the same anticancer drugs plus  the placebo. <Reference refidx="1"/></ListItem><ListItem>A fourth  trial found that patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000444983">colorectal cancer</GlossaryTermRef> who received only hydrazine sulfate lived for a shorter time than patients who received only a placebo.</ListItem></ItemizedList></ListItem><ListItem>Four other randomized controlled trials studied the effects of hydrazine sulfate on nutritional status and metabolism.

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.

  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_2"><Title>General CAM Information</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_3">Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also referred to as integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_4">Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_5">Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. </Para></SummarySection> 
  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_6"><Title>Evaluation of CAM Approaches</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_7">It is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute  and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_8">Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH)  in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.</Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_9"><ExternalRef xref="http://cam.cancer.gov/cam/best_case_intro.html">The NCI Best Case Series Program</ExternalRef>   which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM).
