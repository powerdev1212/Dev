has been reported as 16 months for patients with malignant pleural disease and 5 months for patients with
extensive disease.  In some instances, the tumor grows through the
diaphragm making the site of origin difficult to assess.  Cautious
interpretation of treatment results with this disease is imperative because of
the selection differences among series.  Effusions, both pleural and
peritoneal, represent major symptomatic problems for at least 66% of the
patients.  (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000352186" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/cardiopulmonary-hp-pdq">Cardiopulmonary Syndromes</SummaryRef> for more information.)

both (biphasic).  Desmoplastic mesothelioma, consisting of bland tumor cells between dense bands of stroma, is a subtype of sarcomatoid mesothelioma. The epithelioid form is occasionally confused with lung adenocarcinoma or metastatic carcinomas.  Epithelioid tumors account for approximately 60% of mesothelioma diagnoses.<Reference refidx="1"/> Attempts to diagnose by
cytology or needle biopsy of the pleura are often unsuccessful.  It can be
especially difficult to differentiate mesothelioma from adenocarcinoma on small
tissue specimens.  Thoracoscopy can be valuable in obtaining adequate tissue
specimens for diagnostic purposes.<Reference refidx="2"/>  
</Para><Para id="_151">Examination of the gross tumor at
surgery and use of special stains or electron microscopy can often help to  determine diagnosis.  Pancytokeratin stains are positive in nearly all mesotheliomas.<Reference refidx="1"/> Particularly useful immunohistochemical stains for  the differential diagnosis of epithelioid mesothelioma include cytokeratin 5 and 6, calretinin, WT-1, and D2-40. Calretinin and D2-40 positivity in combination with pancytokeratin positivity is most useful to  distinguish sarcomatoid mesothelioma from sarcoma and  other histologies.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Histologic
appearance seems to be of prognostic value, and  most clinical studies
show that patients with epithelial mesotheliomas have a better prognosis than those with sarcomatoid or biphasic mesotheliomas.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/></Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Travis W, Brambilla E, Müller-Hermelink H, et al., eds.: Pathology and Genetics of Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, and Thymus.

Trimodality therapy refers to a combination of chemotherapy, definitive surgery, and radiation therapy. Because of  the rarity of mesothelioma and the complexities of patient selection, surgical technique, and optimal sequencing of therapy, delivery of such therapy in centers with medical personnel who have established experience and expertise in the management of mesothelioma has shown better results.

With a total of 456 enrolled patients in the trial,  226 patients received pemetrexed plus cisplatin; 222 patients received cisplatin alone,  and 8 patients did not  receive therapy. After 117 patients had enrolled, folic acid and vitamin B<Subscript>12</Subscript> were added to reduce toxic effects.  Folic acid (350–1,000 µg orally) was given daily, beginning 1 to 3 weeks before the first chemotherapy dose and continuing daily until 1 to 3 weeks after treatment ended.  A vitamin B<Subscript>12</Subscript> injection (1,000 µg intramuscularly) was administered 1 to 3 weeks before the first chemotherapy dose and was repeated approximately every 9 weeks until treatment ended.

The hazard ratio for death of patients in the pemetrexed plus cisplatin arm versus those in the control arm was 0.77.

The median survival was 13.3 in the combination arm and 10.0 months in the cisplatin alone arm (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .051).
