oncology.  These may include total mortality (or survival from the initiation
of therapy), cause-specific mortality, quality of life, or indirect surrogates
of the four outcomes, such as event-free survival, disease-free survival, progression-free
survival, or tumor response rate.  Endpoints may also be determined within
study designs of varying strength, ranging from the gold standard—the
randomized, double-blinded controlled clinical trial—to case series
experiences from nonconsecutive patients.  The PDQ editorial boards use a
formal ranking system of levels of evidence to help the reader judge the
strength of evidence linked to the reported results of a therapeutic strategy. 
For any given therapy, results can be ranked on each of the following two
scales: (1) strength of the study design and (2) strength of the endpoints. 
Together, the two rankings give an idea of the overall level of evidence. 
Depending on perspective, different expert panels, professional organizations,
or individual physicians may use different cut points of overall strength of
evidence in formulating therapeutic guidelines or in taking action; however,
a formal description of the level of evidence provides a uniform framework for
the data, leading to specific recommendations.</Para><Para id="_32">The <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/adult-treatment">PDQ Adult Treatment Editorial Board</ExternalRef> and the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/pediatric-treatment">PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board</ExternalRef> add information on levels of evidence,
described below, to the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/adult-treatment">PDQ Adult Cancer Treatment Summaries</ExternalRef> and the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/pediatric-treatment">PDQ Pediatric Cancer Treatment Summaries</ExternalRef>  when appropriate.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_33"><Title>Strength of Study Design</Title><Para id="_34">The various types of study design are described below in descending order of strength:</Para><OrderedList id="_35" Style="Arabic" Compact="No"><ListItem><Strong>Randomized, controlled, clinical trials.</Strong><OrderedList id="_36" Style="LRoman"><ListItem><Strong>Double-blinded.</Strong></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Nonblinded treatment delivery.</Strong></ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_37">The randomized, double-blinded, controlled, clinical trial (1i)
is the gold standard of study design.  To achieve this ranking, the study
allocation must be blinded to the physician both before and after
the randomization and the treatment assignment take place.  This design provides
protection from allocation bias by the investigator and from bias in
assessment of outcomes by both the investigator and the patient. 
Unfortunately, most clinical trials in oncology cannot be double-blinded
after treatment allocation because procedures or toxic effects often vary
substantially among study allocations in ways that are obvious to both
the health care professional and the patient.  In most cases, however, it
should be possible to blind the investigator and the patient until the
randomization has been made.  If blinding of the therapy delivered cannot
be accomplished, a rank of 1ii is assigned.
</Para><Para id="_38">Meta-analyses of randomized studies offer a quantitative synthesis of
previously conducted studies.  The strength of evidence from a
meta-analysis is based on the quality of the conduct of individual
studies.  Moreover, meta-analyses can magnify small systematic errors in
individual studies.  A study comparing the results of single, large, randomized
trials to those of meta-analyses of smaller trials published earlier on 
the same topics showed only fair agreement (kappa statistic = 0.35).  Outcomes
of the large, randomized, controlled trials were not predicted accurately by
the meta-analysis 35% of the time.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>  Meta-analyses performed by different
investigators to address the same clinical issue can reach contradictory
conclusions.<Reference refidx="2"/>  Therefore, meta-analyses of randomized studies are placed in
the same category of strength of evidence as are randomized studies, not at a
higher level.</Para><Para id="_39">Subset analyses of randomized studies are subject to errors inherent in
multiplicity (i.e., statistically significant results to be expected as
a result of random variation of measured effects in multiple subsets). 
Therefore, subset analyses do not represent the same strength of evidence
as the overall analysis of a randomized trial as designed unless explicit
prospective hypotheses are made for the analyzed subset.  Otherwise,
subset analyses should be placed in the next lower category of study design
(nonrandomized, controlled, clinical trials).</Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Nonrandomized, controlled, clinical trials.</Strong><Para id="_40">This category includes trials in which treatment allocation was
made by birth date, chart number, day of clinic appointment, bed
availability, or any other strategy that would make the allocation known
to the investigator before informed consent is obtained from the patient. 
An imbalance can occur in treatment
allocation under such circumstances.  For the reasons given above, subset
analyses within randomized trials often fall into this category of
evidence.</Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Case series.</Strong><OrderedList id="_41" Style="LRoman"><ListItem><Strong>Population-based, consecutive series.</Strong></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Consecutive cases (not population-based).</Strong></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Nonconsecutive cases.</Strong></ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_42">These clinical experiences are the weakest form of study
design, but they may be the only available or practical information in
support of a therapeutic strategy, especially in the case of rare
diseases or when the evolution of the therapy predates the common use of
randomized study designs in medical practice.  They may also provide the only
practical design when treatments in study arms are radically different
(e.g., amputation vs. limb-sparing surgery).  Nevertheless, these
experiences do not have internal controls and must  look to
outside experiences for comparison.  This always raises the issues of
patient selection and comparability with other populations.  In order of
generalizability to other populations are population-based series,
nonpopulation-based but consecutive series, and nonconsecutive cases.

total mortality and more subject to investigator bias in its
determination.  This endpoint  may also miss important effects of therapy that may
actually shorten overall survival.</Para>
</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Carefully assessed quality of life.</Strong><Para id="_48">This is an extremely important endpoint to patients.  Careful

More
importantly,  they may, but do not automatically, translate into direct patient benefit
such as survival or quality of life.  Nevertheless, it is rational in many
circumstances to use a treatment that improves these surrogate endpoints while awaiting a more definitive endpoint to support its use.
</Para></ListItem></OrderedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_51"><Title>Summation</Title><Para id="_52">Because studies or clinical experiences are ranked both by
strength of design and importance of endpoint, a given study would have
a two-tiered ranking (e.g., 1iiA for a nonblinded randomized study
showing a favorable outcome in overall survival and 3iiiDiv for a
phase II trial of selected patients with response rate as the outcome). 
In addition, all recommendations must take into account other issues that
cannot be so easily quantified, such as toxicity, width of confidence
intervals of observations, trial size, quality assurance in the trial,
and cost.  Nevertheless, the PDQ ranking system provides an ordinal
categorization of strength of evidence as a starting point for
discussions of study results.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_26"><SectMetaData><SectionType>Changes to summary</SectionType></SectMetaData><Title>Changes to This Summary (06/19/2015)</Title><Para id="_27">The PDQ cancer information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as new information becomes available.
