important risk factor for ovarian cancer is a family history of a first-degree
relative (e.g.,  mother, daughter, or sister) with the disease.  Approximately 20% of ovarian cancers are familial, and although most of these are linked to mutations in the <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> or <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> genes, several other genes have been implicated in familial ovarian cancers.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/> The highest risk
appears in women who have two  or more first-degree relatives with ovarian cancer.<Reference refidx="8"/> 
The risk is somewhat less for women who have  one first-degree and one second-degree relative (grandmother or aunt) with ovarian cancer.</Para><Para id="_624">In most families affected
with the breast and ovarian cancer syndrome or site-specific ovarian cancer,
genetic linkage has been found to the <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> locus on chromosome 17q21.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/> 
<GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName>, also responsible for some instances of inherited ovarian and breast
cancer, has been mapped by genetic linkage to chromosome 13q12.<Reference refidx="12"/>  The
lifetime risk for developing ovarian cancer in patients harboring germline
mutations in <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> is substantially increased over that of the general population.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/> 
Two retrospective studies of patients with germline mutations in <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> suggest
that these women have improved survival compared with  <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> mutation-negative
women.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335150">Level of evidence: 3iiiA</LOERef>]  Most women with a <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> mutation probably have
family members with a history of ovarian and/or breast cancer;  therefore,
these women may have been more vigilant and inclined to participate in cancer
screening programs that may have led to earlier detection.  </Para><Para id="_625">For women  at
increased risk, prophylactic oophorectomy may be considered after age 35
 years if childbearing is complete.    In a family-based study among women with <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> or <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutations, of the 259 women who had undergone bilateral prophylactic oophorectomy, 2 of them (0.8%) developed subsequent papillary serous peritoneal carcinoma, and 6 of them (2.8%) had stage I ovarian cancer at the time of surgery. Of the 292 matched controls, 20% who did not have prophylactic surgery developed ovarian cancer. Prophylactic surgery was associated with  a higher-than-90% reduction in the risk of ovarian cancer (relative risk [RR], 0.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01–0.16), with an average follow-up of   9 years;<Reference refidx="17"/> however, family-based studies may be associated with biases resulting from  case selection and other factors that may influence the estimate of benefit.<Reference refidx="18"/> (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062771#_9" url="/types/ovarian/hp/ovarian-prevention-pdq">Description of the Evidence</SummaryRef> section in the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062771" url="/types/ovarian/hp/ovarian-prevention-pdq">Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer Prevention</SummaryRef> for more information.)</Para><Para id="_626">After
a prophylactic oophorectomy, a small percentage of women may develop a
primary peritoneal carcinoma, similar in appearance to ovarian cancer.<Reference refidx="19"/>  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_560"><Title>Histopathology</Title><Para id="_5">Ovarian cancer usually spreads via local shedding into the peritoneal cavity
followed by implantation on the peritoneum and via local invasion of bowel and
bladder.  The incidence of positive nodes at primary surgery has been reported
to be as high as 24% in patients with stage I disease, 50% in patients with stage II
disease, 74% in patients with stage III disease, and 73% in patients with stage
IV disease.<Reference refidx="20"/>  In this study, the pelvic nodes were involved as often as the
para-aortic nodes.  Tumor cells may also block diaphragmatic lymphatics.  The
resulting impairment of lymphatic drainage of the peritoneum is thought to play
a role in development of ascites in ovarian cancer.  Also, transdiaphragmatic
spread to the pleura is common.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_561"><Title>Prognosis</Title><Para id="_578">For patients with stage I disease, the most
important prognostic factor is grade, followed by dense adherence, and
large-volume ascites.<Reference refidx="21"/>  The use of DNA flow cytometric analysis of stage I and stage
IIA patients may identify a group of high-risk patients.<Reference refidx="22"/>  Patients with
clear cell histology appear to have a worse prognosis.<Reference refidx="23"/>  Patients with a
significant component of transitional cell carcinoma appear to have a better
prognosis.<Reference refidx="24"/> Stage I tumors have a high proportion of low-grade serous cancers and have a distinctly different derivation than high-grade serous cancers, which usually present in stages III and IV. Many high-grade serous cancers originate in the fallopian tube and other areas of extrauterine mullerian epithelial origin.</Para><Para id="_165">Prognosis for patients with ovarian cancer is influenced by several factors, but multivariate
analyses suggest that the most important favorable factors include the following:<Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_166" Style="bullet"><ListItem> Younger age.</ListItem><ListItem>Good performance status.</ListItem><ListItem>Cell type other than mucinous and clear cell.</ListItem><ListItem>Lower

significance when measured at the time of diagnosis, it has a high correlation
with survival when measured 1 month after the third course of chemotherapy
for patients with stage III or stage IV disease.<Reference refidx="30"/>  For patients whose
elevated CA-125 normalizes with chemotherapy, more than one subsequent elevated
CA-125 measurement is highly predictive of active disease, but this does not mandate
immediate therapy.<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/>
</Para><Para id="_532">Case-control studies suggest that <GeneName>BRCA1</GeneName> and <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutation carriers have improved responses to chemotherapy when compared with patients with sporadic epithelial ovarian cancer.  This may be the result of a deficient homologous DNA repair mechanism in these tumors, which leads to increased sensitivity to chemotherapy agents.<Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/> </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_562"><Title>Survival and Follow-up</Title><Para id="_348">Most patients with  ovarian cancer have widespread disease at presentation.  This may be partly explained by relatively early spread (and implantation) of high-grade papillary serous cancers to the rest of the peritoneal cavity.<Reference refidx="35"/> Conversely, symptoms such as abdominal pain and swelling, gastrointestinal symptoms, and pelvic pain often go unrecognized, leading to delays in diagnosis. Screening procedures such as gynecologic assessment, vaginal ultrasound, and CA-125 assay have had low predictive value in detecting ovarian cancer in women without special risk factors.<Reference refidx="36"/><Reference refidx="37"/>  Efforts have been made  to  enhance physician and patient awareness of the occurrence of these nonspecific symptoms.<Reference refidx="38"/><Reference refidx="39"/><Reference refidx="40"/><Reference refidx="41"/><Reference refidx="42"/>   (Refer to the PDQ summaries on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062738" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/pain/pain-hp-pdq">Pain</SummaryRef> and <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062736" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/constipation/GI-complications-hp-pdq">Gastrointestinal Complications</SummaryRef> for more information.)   As a result of these confounding factors,
yearly mortality in ovarian cancer is approximately 65% of the incidence rate. 
</Para><Para id="_635">Long-term follow-up of suboptimally debulked stage III and stage IV patients
showed a 5-year survival rate lower than 10% with platinum-based
combination therapy prior to the current generation of trials, including taxanes.<Reference refidx="25"/> By contrast, optimally debulked stage III patients treated with a combination of intravenous taxane and intraperitoneal platinum plus taxane achieved a median survival of 66  months in a Gynecologic Oncology Group  trial.<Reference refidx="43"/>  </Para><Para id="_636">Numerous clinical trials are in progress to

postoperative drug and radiation therapy.  Patients with any stage of ovarian
cancer are appropriate candidates for clinical trials.<Reference refidx="44"/><Reference refidx="45"/> Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials">NCI Web site</ExternalRef>.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_448"><Title>Related Summaries</Title><Para id="_449">Other  PDQ summaries containing information related to ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer include the following: </Para><ItemizedList id="_450" Style="bullet"><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062855" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-ovarian-genetics-pdq">Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers</SummaryRef></ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062771" url="/types/ovarian/hp/ovarian-prevention-pdq">Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer Prevention</SummaryRef></ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062760" url="/types/ovarian/hp/ovarian-screening-pdq">Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer Screening</SummaryRef></ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062872#_79" url="/types/childhood-cancers/hp/unusual-cancers-childhood-pdq">Unusual Cancers of Childhood</SummaryRef> (childhood cancer of the ovarian epithelium)</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="8420671" MedlineID="93130474">Yancik R: Ovarian cancer.

Other stratification factors were for institution, method of biopsy (i.e., image-guided, laparoscopy, laparotomy, or fine-needle aspiration), and tumor stage (i.e., stages IIIC or IV).

When several drugs were studied, mostly in the setting of minimal residual disease at reassessment after patients had received their initial chemotherapy, cisplatin alone and in combination received the most attention.  Favorable outcomes from IP cisplatin were most often seen when tumors had shown responsiveness to platinums and with small-volume tumors (usually defined as tumors &lt;1 cm).<Reference refidx="6"/>  In the 1990s, randomized trials were conducted to evaluate whether the IP route would prove superior to the intravenous (IV) route.  IP cisplatin was the common denominator of these randomized trials. </Para><Para id="_597">The use of IP cisplatin as part of the initial up-front approach in patients with stage III optimally debulked ovarian cancer is supported principally by  the results of three randomized clinical trials (SWOG-8501, GOG-0114, and <ProtocolRef href="CDR0000066273" nct_id="NCT00003322">GOG-0172</ProtocolRef>).<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/> These studies tested the role of IP drugs (IP cisplatin in all three studies and IP paclitaxel in the last study) against the standard IV regimen. In the three studies, superior progression-free survival (PFS) and OS favoring the IP arm were documented.  Specifically, the most recent study, GOG-0172,  resulted in a median survival rate of 66 months for patients on the IP arm versus 50 months for patients who received IV administration of cisplatin and paclitaxel (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .03).<Reference refidx="9"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335125">Level of evidence:1iiA</LOERef>] Toxic effects were greater in the IP arm, contributed to in large part by the cisplatin dose per cycle (100 mg/m<Superscript>2</Superscript>) and by sensory neuropathy from the additional IP as well as from the IV administration of  paclitaxel.  The rate of  completion of six cycles of treatment was also less frequent  in the IP arm (42% vs. 83%) because of the toxic effects and catheter-related problems.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_598">Notwithstanding these problems, IP therapy for patients with optimally debulked ovarian cancer is receiving wider adoption, and efforts are under way by the GOG to examine some modifications of the  IP regimen used in GOG-0172 to improve its tolerability (e.g., to reduce by ≥25% the total 3-hour amount of cisplatin given; a shift from the less practical 24-hour IV administration of paclitaxel to a  3-hour IV administration).

In patients who are in clinical complete remission,  increases in CA-125 from their initial treatment represent the most common method to detect disease that will eventually relapse clinically. </Para><Para id="_354">A trial by the Medical Research Council and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (<ProtocolRef href="CDR0000065218" nct_id="NCT00002895">MRC-OV05</ProtocolRef>, which is now closed)  examined the consequences of early institution of treatment for recurrence versus treatment delayed until clinical symptoms appeared.<Reference refidx="2"/> Patients in clinical complete remission after platinum-based chemotherapy were registered and followed with CA-125s only and clinical visits. Upon detection of a twofold elevation over the normal range, patients were randomly assigned to disclosure of the result (and early treatment for recurrence) versus continued blinding and treatment upon development of signs and symptoms indicative of clinical relapse. The number of randomly assigned patients was to exceed 500 in order to yield a superior survival outcome at 2 years with early institution of therapy; this required 1,400 registrations, which were  accrued between May 1996 and August 2005. Among 1,442 registrants, 29% continued to show no evidence of relapse, 19% relapsed without evidence of CA-125 doubling beyond normal or at the same time, and another 4% died before becoming eligible for random assignment.  Registrants had stage III and stage  IV disease in 67% of the cases, whereas these stages represented 80% of the randomly assigned patients. The median survival of all patients registered was 70.8 months. </Para><Para id="_355">Median survival for patients randomly assigned to early treatment (n = 265) was 25.7 months compared with 27.1 months for patients in the delayed-treatment group (n = 264) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI],  0.8–1.2).   The median delay in instituting second-line chemotherapy was 4.8 months, and the median delay in instituting third-line chemotherapy was 4.6 months. Treatments for second-line chemotherapy were comparable among the two groups (mostly platinum- and taxane-based), whereas third-line treatments were less often applied to the delayed-treatment group. The study concluded that there was no benefit in the detection of early presence of disease by CA-125; this is consistent with the failure of second-look surgeries to provide improved outcomes after early detection of persistent disease.   Monitoring CA-125 levels in follow-up may play a role in identifying appropriate candidates for secondary cytoreduction, although this strategy awaits confirmation with a randomized trial.</Para><SummarySection id="_291"><Title>Local Modalities: Surgery and Radiation Therapy</Title><Para id="_275">Cytoreduction is often employed,<Reference refidx="3"/> but such intervention is only now being studied in the setting of a randomized clinical trial (<ProtocolRef href="CDR0000546714" nct_id="NCT00565851">GOG-0213</ProtocolRef>).

cisplatin plus doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (CAP), yielded a superior survival outcome. This, and subsequent studies (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062829#_473" url="/types/ovarian/hp/ovarian-epithelial-treatment-pdq">Table 3</SummaryRef>), have reinforced using carboplatin as the treatment core for patients with platinum-sensitive recurrences. Cisplatin is occasionally used, particularly in combination with other drugs,  because of its lesser myelosuppression, but this advantage over carboplatin is counterbalanced by greater patient intolerance. Oxaliplatin, initially introduced with the hope that it would overcome platinum resistance, has activity mostly in platinum-sensitive patients <Reference refidx="11"/> but has not been compared with carboplatin alone or in combinations.  </Para><Para id="_536">With all platinums, outcome is generally better the longer the initial interval without recurrence from the initial platinum-containing regimens.<Reference refidx="12"/> Therefore, on occasion, patients with platinum-sensitive recurrences relapsing within 1 year have been included in trials of nonplatinum drugs.

Platinum plus paclitaxel was compared with several control regimens, although 71% used carboplatin as a single agent in the control, and 80% used carboplatin plus paclitaxel.
