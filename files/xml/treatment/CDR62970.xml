			 </KeyPoint><Para id="_122">Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045713">hormones</GlossaryTermRef> or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing.  Hormones are substances made by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046386">glands</GlossaryTermRef> in the body and circulated in the bloodstream.  Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow.  If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044958">receptors</GlossaryTermRef>), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.</Para><Para id="_123">The effectiveness of hormone therapy,  alone or combined with chemotherapy, in

Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/espanol/recursos/pdq">Spanish</ExternalRef>.</Para><Para id="_AboutThis_4">PDQ is a service of the NCI.

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_AboutThis_10"><Title>Clinical Trial Information</Title><Para id="_AboutThis_11">A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
