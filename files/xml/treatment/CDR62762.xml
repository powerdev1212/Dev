occur in the United States in 2015.<Reference refidx="1"/> Also, approximately 1,250,000 women will be diagnosed with precancers annually by cytology using the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear.  A continuum of pathologic changes may be diagnosed, ranging from atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance to low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) to high-grade  squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) to invasive cancer.  The precancerous conditions LSIL and HSIL are also referred to as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, 2, and 3.  Lesions can regress, persist, or progress to an invasive malignancy, with LSIL (CIN 1) more likely to regress spontaneously and HSIL (CIN 2/CIN 3) more likely to persist or progress. The average time for progression of CIN 3 to invasive cancer has been estimated to be 10 to 15 years.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_210"><Title>Factors With Adequate Evidence of an Increased Risk of Cervical Cancer </Title><SummarySection id="_211"><Title>Human papillomavirus (HPV)</Title><Para id="_212">Epidemiologic studies to evaluate risk factors for the development of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) and
cervical malignancy demonstrate conclusively a sexual mode of transmission of a
carcinogen.<Reference refidx="3"/>  It is now widely accepted that HPV is the primary etiologic
infectious agent that causes virtually all cases of cervical cancer.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>  Other sexually transmitted factors, including
herpes simplex virus 2 and <ScientificName>Chlamydia trachomatis</ScientificName>, may play a cocausative role.<Reference refidx="6"/> More than 80 distinct types of HPV have been identified, approximately 30 of which infect the
human genital tract.  HPV type 16 (HPV-16) and HPV type 18 (HPV-18) are most often associated with
invasive disease.  Characterization of carcinogenic risk associated with HPV
types is an important step in the process of developing a combination HPV
vaccine for the prevention of cervical neoplasia.  In a population-based study
of HPV infection and cervical neoplasia in Costa Rica, 80% of HSIL and invasive lesions were associated
with HPV infection by one or more of 13 cancer-associated types.<Reference refidx="7"/>  In this
study, the risk of about one-half of HSIL and invasive cervical cancer was
attributable to HPV-16.  HPV-18 was associated with 15% of invasive disease
but only 5% of HSIL, suggesting that HPV-18 may have a role in more aggressive
cases of cervical malignancy.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_295"><Title>Immunosuppression</Title><Para id="_296">Most cases of HPV infection are resolved by the host immune system.  Immunosuppression leads to persistence of viral infection with a subsequent increased risk of cervical neoplasia.   Women with immunosuppression due to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have been studied over the past three decades of the AIDS epidemic.   In one North American study, a group of 13,690 HIV-infected women were studied for a median of 5 years.  The rate of invasive cervical cancer in the HIV-infected women was 26 cases per 100,000 women, and this was approximately four times greater than an HIV-uninfected control group.<Reference refidx="8"/> HIV-infected women with the lowest CD4 lymphocyte counts were at the highest risk of invasive cancer.   
Women who are immunosuppressed due to organ transplantation are also at risk of invasive cervical cancer, and one meta-analysis found a twofold increased risk.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_217"><Title>High parity</Title><Para id="_218">High parity has long been recognized as a risk factor for cervical cancer, but the relation of parity to HPV infection was uncertain.  A meta-analysis of 25 epidemiologic studies, including 16,563 women with cervical cancer and 33,542 women without cervical cancer, showed that the number of full-term pregnancies was associated with increased risk, regardless of age at first pregnancy. This finding was also true if analyses were limited to patients with high-risk HPV infections (relative risk,   4.99; 95% confidence interval [CI],  3.49–7.13 for seven or more  pregnancies versus no pregnancies; linear trend test X<Superscript>2</Superscript> =       30.69; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt;      .001).<Reference refidx="10"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_297"><Title>Long term use of oral contraceptives</Title><Para id="_219">Long-term use of oral contraceptives has also been known to be associated with cervical cancer, but its relation to HPV infection was also uncertain.  A pooled analysis of HPV-positive women from the studies described above was undertaken.  Compared with  women who have never used oral contraceptives, those who have used them for fewer than 5 years did not have an increased risk of cervical cancer (odds ratio [OR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52–1.03).  The OR for women who used oral contraceptives for 5 to 9 years was 2.82 (95% CI, 1.46–5.42), and for 10 or more years, the OR was 4.03 (95% CI, 2.09–8.02).<Reference refidx="11"/>    A meta-analysis of 24 epidemiological studies confirmed the increased risk associated with oral contraceptives, which is proportionate to the duration of use. Risk decreases after cessation and returns to normal risk levels in 10 years.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_215"><Title>Cigarette smoke exposure</Title><Para id="_216">Cigarette smoking by women is associated with an increased risk of squamous
cell carcinoma.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/>  This risk increases with longer duration and
intensity of smoking. The risk among smokers may be present with exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke and may be as high as four times that of women who are nonsmokers who are not exposed to environmental smoking.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Case-control studies of women infected with HPV have examined the effect of various types and levels of tobacco exposure and found similar results.<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_298"><Title>Diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure</Title><Para id="_299">DES is a synthetic form of estrogen that was prescribed to pregnant women in the United States between 1940 and 1971 to prevent miscarriage and premature labor. DES is associated with a substantially increased risk of developing clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix among the daughters of women who used the drug during pregnancy (standardized incidence ratio, 24.23; 95% CI, 8.89–52.74); the risk persists as these women age into their 40s.<Reference refidx="16"/> Despite the greatly elevated risk relative to the general population, this type of cancer is still rare; about one in 1,000 daughters exposed to DES will develop a clear cell adenocarcinoma.  </Para><Para id="_300">DES exposure <Emphasis>in utero</Emphasis> is also associated with an increased risk of developing cervical dysplasia. An evaluation of three cohorts, including the Diethylstilbestrol Adenosis study, the Dieckmann study, and the Women’s Health Study, with long-term follow-up of more than 4,500 women exposed <Emphasis>in utero</Emphasis> to DES, found that 6.9% of exposed women developed grade II or higher CIN compared with 3.4% of nonexposed women (hazard ratio, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.59–3.27).<Reference refidx="17"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_220"><Title>Factors With Adequate Evidence of a Decreased Risk of Cervical Cancer</Title><SummarySection id="_301"><Title>Sexual abstinence</Title><Para id="_302">Nearly all cases of cervical cancer are associated with HPV infection, which is transmitted during sexual activity.

A quadrivalent (HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18) vaccine using a late protein L1 construct to induce antibody-mediated immunity was approved for use by the FDA in 2006; a bivalent (HPV-16, -18) vaccine was approved in 2009; and a vaccine targeting nine HPV types was approved in 2014.</Para><Para id="_326">Persistent infection with oncogenic types of HPV, such as HPV-16 and HPV-18, is associated with the development of cervical cancer.<Reference refidx="19"/>    A vaccine to prevent HPV infection with oncogenic-type viruses has the potential to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer.  A vaccine against HPV-16 using empty-viral capsids called virus-like particles (VLP) was developed and tested for efficacy in preventing persistent infection with HPV-16.</Para><Para id="_327">A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 2,391 women aged 16 to 23 years and randomly assigned them to receive either 40 µg of HPV-16 L1  VLP vaccine or placebo on day 1, at 2 months, and at 6 months. Papanicolaou (Pap) tests and genital samples for HPV-16 DNA were obtained on day 1, at 7 months, and every 6 months for 48 months. Colposcopy and cervical biopsies were obtained when clinically indicated at study exit. Serum HPV-16 antibody titers were obtained at study entry, at 7 months, and then every 6 months.  A total of 1,505 women (755 receiving vaccine and 750 receiving placebo) completed all three vaccinations and had follow-up after month 7. After immunization, HPV titers peaked at month 7, declined through month 18, and then stabilized in months 30 through 48. There were no cases of CIN in the vaccine-treated women, but there were 12 cases in the placebo group (six CIN 2 and six CIN 3). HPV-16 infection that  persisted for at least 4 months was seen in seven vaccine-treated women compared with 111 placebo-treated women.<Reference refidx="20"/></Para><Para id="_328">An international, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a bivalent HPV-16/HPV-18 VLP vaccine was performed in 1,113 women aged 15 to 25 years with normal cervical cytology who were seronegative for HPV-16, HPV-18, and 12 other oncogenic HPV types at enrollment. Women received either vaccine or placebo  at 0, 1, and 6 months and were assessed by cervical cytology and self-obtained cervicovaginal samples for at least 18 months.  A masked treatment allocation follow-up study was performed for an additional 3 years, for a combined analysis of up to 6.4 years of follow-up.  The 12-month persistent infection rate of HPV-16 or HPV-18 in an "according-to-protocol" cohort (i.e., women who received all three doses of vaccine or placebo on the correct schedule) was 0 of 401 women in the vaccine arm compared with 20 of 372 women in the placebo arm, with a vaccine efficacy of 100% (95% CI, 81.8–100).  Diagnoses of CIN 2 or higher in a “total vaccinated” cohort (i.e., women who received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo) were 0  of 481 women in the vaccine arm compared with                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      9 of 470 women in the placebo arm, with a vaccine efficacy of 100% (95% CI, 51.3–100). Adverse events were similar in vaccinated and placebo-treated women.   It is important to note that neither analysis was intention-to-treat (ITT), making it difficult to know what the true vaccine efficacy for either virological or cytohistological endpoints would be in the routine clinical setting.  Furthermore, cytohistological outcomes were reported only as composite endpoints (CIN 2+), making it impossible to distinguish the vaccine’s efficacy against invasive cervical cancer alone and potentially inflating the observed efficacy by including lesions with a relatively high probability (approximately 50% for CIN 2 <Reference refidx="21"/>) of spontaneous regression.<Reference refidx="22"/></Para><Para id="_329">A quadrivalent vaccine (HPV types-6, -11, -16, and -18)       was evaluated in  a multinational, double-blind,              randomized controlled trial of   17,622 women aged  15 to 26 years (FUTURE I and II).<Reference refidx="23"/>          Women received either the HPV vaccine or placebo at 0, 2, and 6 months; participants were assessed by clinical exam, Pap test, and HPV DNA testing for  4 or more years.
