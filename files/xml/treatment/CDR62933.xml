cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team
of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during
childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following health care professionals and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
that will achieve optimal survival and quality of life:</Para><ItemizedList id="_778" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Primary care physicians.</ListItem><ListItem>Pediatric surgeons.</ListItem><ListItem>Radiation oncologists. </ListItem><ListItem>Pediatric medical oncologists and hematologists.</ListItem><ListItem>Rehabilitation specialists.</ListItem><ListItem>Pediatric nurse specialists.</ListItem><ListItem>Social workers.</ListItem><ListItem>Child life professionals.</ListItem><ListItem>Psychologists.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_825">(Refer to the PDQ <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/supportive-care">Supportive and Palliative Care</ExternalRef>  summaries for specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer.)
</Para><Para id="_161">Guidelines for pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of
pediatric patients with cancer have been outlined by the American Academy of
Pediatrics.<Reference refidx="2"/>  At these pediatric cancer centers, clinical trials are
available for most types of cancer that occur in children and
adolescents, and the opportunity to participate in these trials is offered to
most patients and families.  Clinical trials for children and adolescents with
cancer are generally designed to compare potentially better therapy with
therapy that is currently accepted as standard.  Most of the progress
made in identifying curative therapies for childhood cancers has been achieved
through clinical trials.  Information about ongoing clinical trials is
available from the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials">NCI website</ExternalRef>.</Para><Para id="_268">Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer.<Reference refidx="1"/> Between 1975 and 2010, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%. For Hodgkin lymphoma, the 5-year survival rate has increased over the same time from 81% to more than 95% for children and adolescents.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because late effects of cancer therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000343584" url="/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq">Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer</SummaryRef>  for specific information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors.)</Para><SummarySection id="_423"><Title>Overview of Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma </Title><Para id="_162">Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is one of the few pediatric malignancies that shares aspects of its biology and natural history with an adult cancer. When treatment approaches for children were modeled after those used for adults, substantial morbidities resulted from  the unacceptably high radiation doses.  Thus, new strategies utilizing chemotherapy and lower-dose radiation were developed.  Approximately 90% to 95%  of children with Hodgkin  lymphoma can be cured, prompting increased attention to devising therapy that produces less long-term morbidity for these patients. Contemporary treatment programs use a risk-based and response-adapted approach in which patients receive multiagent chemotherapy  with or without   low-dose involved-field or involved-site radiation therapy. 




 Prognostic factors used in determining chemotherapy intensity include stage, presence or absence of B symptoms (fever, weight loss, and night sweats), and/or bulky disease. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_420"><Title>Epidemiology</Title><Para id="_163">Hodgkin lymphoma comprises 6% of childhood cancers.

The definition of bulk has varied across pediatric protocols and evolved over time with advances in diagnostic imaging technology.  
In North American protocols, the posteroanterior chest radiograph remains important because the criterion for bulky <Strong>mediastinal</Strong> lymphadenopathy is defined by the ratio of the diameter of the mediastinal lymph node mass to the maximal diameter of the rib cage on an upright chest radiograph; a ratio of 33% or higher is considered bulky. In contrast, the EuroNet-Pediatric Hodgkin Lymphoma Group defines mediastinal bulk by the volume of the largest contiguous lymph node mass being  200 mL or more on CT.

Although complete response can be defined as absence of disease by clinical examination and/or imaging studies, complete response in Hodgkin lymphoma trials is often defined by a greater than 80% reduction of disease and a change from initial positivity to negativity on functional imaging.<Reference refidx="30"/> This definition is necessary in Hodgkin lymphoma because fibrotic residual disease is common, particularly in the mediastinum. In some studies, such patients are designated as having an unconfirmed complete response.  </ListItem><ListItem>The definition of complete response varies by protocol/cooperative group. GPOH studies use very stringent criteria that includes at least 95% reduction in tumor volume or less than 2 mL residual  volume on CT.
