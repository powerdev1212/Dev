psychologic, interpersonal, and behavioral dimensions.  It is important to
recognize that a wide range of normal sexual functioning exists.  Ultimately,
sexuality is defined by each patient and his/her partner within a context of
factors such as gender, age, personal attitudes, and religious and cultural
values.</Para><Para id="_3">Many types of cancer and cancer therapies are frequently associated with sexual
dysfunction.  Across sites, estimates of sexual dysfunction after various
cancer treatments have ranged from 40% to 100%.<Reference refidx="1"/> Most of the information relates to women who have breast or gynecologic cancer and men who have prostate cancer.  Less is known about  how other types of cancers—in particular, other solid tumors—affect sexuality.  Research
suggests that about 50% of women who have had breast cancer experience 
long-term sexual dysfunction,<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/> as do a similar proportion of women who
have had gynecologic cancer.<Reference refidx="4"/>    For men with prostate cancer, erectile dysfunction (erections inadequate for intercourse) has been the primary form of sexual dysfunction investigated.  Prevalence rates of erectile dysfunction have varied.       In general, those studies that have used patients’ self-reports have found higher rates of erectile dysfunction ranging from 60% to 90% after radical prostatectomy and between 67% and 85% following external-beam radiation therapy.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> Erectile dysfunction appears to be least prevalent with brachytherapy and most prevalent when cryotherapy is used to treat localized prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="9"/>   For Hodgkin lymphoma
and testicular cancer, 25% of people who have had these cancers are left with
long-term sexual problems.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_4">Several summary articles on
sexuality and cancer give particular emphasis on cancer sites that have a
direct impact on sexual functioning.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/> An individual’s sexual response can be affected in a number of ways, and the
causes of sexual dysfunction are often both physiological and psychological. 
The most common sexual problems for people with cancer are the following:<Reference refidx="3"/>  </Para><ItemizedList id="_357" Style="bullet"><ListItem> Loss of desire for
sexual activity in men and women.</ListItem><ListItem>Erectile dysfunction  in men.</ListItem><ListItem>Dyspareunia (pain with intercourse) in
women.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_358">Men may also experience the following: </Para><ItemizedList id="_359" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Anejaculation (absence of ejaculation).</ListItem><ListItem>Retrograde ejaculation (ejaculation going backward to the bladder).</ListItem><ListItem>Inability to reach orgasm.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_360">Women may experience the following: </Para><ItemizedList id="_361" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Changes in genital sensations
due to pain or a loss of sensation and numbness.</ListItem><ListItem>Decreased ability
to reach orgasm.  </ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_362">  Loss of sensation can be as distressing as painful sensation
for some individuals.<Reference refidx="14"/>  In women, premature ovarian failure as a result
of chemotherapy or pelvic radiation therapy is a frequent antecedent to sexual
dysfunction, particularly when hormone replacement is contraindicated because
the malignancy is hormonally sensitive.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_5">Unlike many other physiological side effects of cancer treatment, sexual
problems do not tend to resolve within the first year or two of disease-free
survival;<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/>  rather, they may remain constant and fairly severe or even continue to increase. 
Although it is unclear how much sexual problems influence a survivor’s
rating of overall health-related quality of life, these problems are clearly
bothersome to many patients and interfere with a return to normal 
posttreatment life.  Assessment, referral, intervention, and follow-up are important for maximizing
quality of life and survival.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="17"/>
</Para><Para id="_1_4">In this summary, unless otherwise stated, evidence and practice issues as they relate to adults are discussed.  The evidence and application to practice related to children may differ significantly from information related to adults.  When specific information about the care of children is available, it is summarized under its own heading.</Para><Para id="_295">In a qualitative study of 48 men (130 approached) with erectile dysfunction after
treatment for early prostate cancer,<Reference refidx="20"/> quality of life was significantly affected
in areas such as the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_303" Style="bullet"><ListItem>The quality of sexual intimacy.</ListItem><ListItem>Everyday interactions
with women.</ListItem><ListItem>Sexual fantasy life.</ListItem><ListItem>Perceptions of their masculinity.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_304">Patients who participated in a randomized trial that compared radical prostatectomy with watchful waiting were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding symptoms, psychological functioning, and quality of life.<Reference refidx="21"/>  Although the frequency of sexual thoughts was similar in both groups, the prevalence of erectile dysfunction (changes in voluntary erection in sexual situations, erection on awakening, and spontaneous erections) was higher in the radical prostatectomy group (80%) than in the watchful-waiting group (45%).  Among men who underwent radical prostatectomy, 56% were moderately or greatly distressed by the decline in sexual function, as compared with 40% of men in the watchful-waiting group.<Reference refidx="21"/></Para><Para id="_293">In a different population—that of male lymphoma survivors—a cross-sectional study of 15-year survivors of both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma compared sexual function and hormone levels with those of age-matched controls.<Reference refidx="22"/>  Overall, the authors concluded that sexual function (as measured by the Brief Sexual Function Inventory [BSFI]) was significantly worse in the lymphoma survivors than in controls.  In univariate analysis, lower functioning was attributed to the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_305" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Increased age.</ListItem><ListItem>Lower testosterone.</ListItem><ListItem>Higher luteinizing hormone.</ListItem><ListItem>Greater fatigue and emotional distress.</ListItem><ListItem>At least one comorbidity.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_296">There are several cautions in interpreting these results:</Para><ItemizedList id="_297" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>The types of comorbidities are not listed; hence, it is not known whether cardiovascular disease was prevalent.  </ListItem><ListItem>Multivariate analyses to look at the relative impact of the various contributing factors to lower functioning were not performed.</ListItem><ListItem>Considering the overall mean scores, the BSFI subscale scores were neither that low nor that different from the scores of controls (a difference of &lt;0.5) even though they were statistically significantly different, likely because of the large sample size.  </ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_298">Although the authors concluded that sexual function was worse, it was only slightly worse; however, it reached statistical significance.  Therefore, it is not clear from this study how much sexual functioning contributed to distress or decreased quality of life.<Reference refidx="22"/></Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="6780146" MedlineID="81111424">Derogatis LR, Kourlesis SM: An approach to evaluation of sexual problems in the cancer patient.

</Title><Para id="_11">Sexual function after localized treatment for breast cancer has been the
subject of a good deal of research.  Several reviews concur that breast
conservation or reconstruction have only a minor impact in preserving sexual
function compared with a mastectomy alone.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>  Women who have breast
conservation, in particular, are more likely to continue to enjoy breast
caressing, but groups typically do not differ on less subtle variables such as
the frequency of sex, ease of reaching orgasm, or overall sexual satisfaction. </Para><Para id="_369">A cross-sectional survey of younger women (aged 50 years or younger) with breast cancer found in multivariate analyses that having a mastectomy was associated with greater problems in interest in sex; chemotherapy was associated with greater sexual dysfunction.<Reference refidx="7"/> Other studies confirm that sexual quality of life is disrupted more among  those receiving chemotherapy, those who have undergone total mastectomies, those whose cancers were detected at later stages, and those with more depressive symptoms near the time of diagnosis.<Reference refidx="8"/> A large survey  of women with breast cancer who were being treated with  either adjuvant tamoxifen or adjuvant exemestane (an aromatase inhibitor) was conducted to evaluate the differences in menopausal symptoms associated with these two agents.  After 1 year of use, exemestane was associated with fewer hot flashes and less vaginal discharge than tamoxifen but with more vaginal dryness, bone pain, and sleep disorders.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_206">Few studies evaluate sexuality in women with breast cancer that recurs.  One longitudinal study compared women who were recently diagnosed with recurrent cancer with matched patients who were disease free.  The recurrence group had less frequent intercourse, although there were no differences in sexual or relationship satisfaction.  As noted in other studies of women with breast cancer, sexual changes were more common among younger patients.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_99"><Title>Colorectal cancer
</Title><Para id="_225">Changes related to sexual functioning in men and women with colorectal cancer have not been well studied, and there is scant literature to illuminate the issues and provide understanding and effective solutions.  There are, however, potential changes in sexual function that can result from commonly performed surgery, particularly surgery performed on people with rectal cancer.  This section will describe the possible effects on male sexual function that can occur after rectal cancer surgery.</Para><Para id="_13">Sexual and urinary dysfunctions are recognized complications of resection for
rectal cancer.  The main cause of sexual dysfunction from surgical resection
appears to be injury to the autonomic nerves in the pelvis along the distal
aorta from blunt pelvic resection or undefined cutting.  Incidence of
genitourinary dysfunction depends on the type of surgery performed (i.e., the
plane of dissection, the degree of preservation of the autonomic nerves, and
the extent of pelvic dissection).<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/>  Nerve injury can occur via direct injury,
by vascular damage to the vasa nervosa, or where the blood supply to the nerves
that enter laterally is disrupted with traction or devascularization.<Reference refidx="13"/>
</Para><Para id="_14">The neuroanatomy for sexual functioning requires an intact autonomic nervous
system, which includes an interaction between the parasympathetic and
sympathetic nervous systems.  Erection (parasympathetic-mediated response) is
governed by impulses traveling along the nervi erigentes that arise from the
second, third, and fourth sacral nerves,<Reference refidx="14"/> whereas ejaculation depends on
sympathetic control.  The sympathetic fibers originate from the lower thoracic
and upper lumbar segments of the spinal cord.  These fibers descend along the
aorta, forming the superior hypogastric plexus near the aortic bifurcation. 
The plexus divides into two trunks, which enter the pelvis along its lateral
walls as the hypogastric nerves.  The parasympathetic fibers to the pelvis
join the hypogastric nerves on each pelvic wall to form the pelvic plexuses.<Reference refidx="14"/> 
One study provided a more extensive review of the anatomy of the pelvic
autonomic nerves and the relation of these nerves to the mesorectal fascial
planes.<Reference refidx="15"/>  Damage to the hypogastric (sympathetic) nerves or sacral
splanchnic (parasympathetic) nerves, or both, during surgical resection are the
most likely cause of urinary and sexual dysfunction.<Reference refidx="16"/>  Pelvic plexus
preservation is necessary to maintain erectile functioning, and both
hypogastric nerve and pelvic plexus preservation are necessary to maintain
ejaculate function and orgasm.<Reference refidx="17"/>
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_100"><Title>Prostate cancer</Title><Para id="_16">There is controversy  about whether the newer nerve-sparing technique for
radical prostatectomy (RP) is more successful in preserving erectile
function than definitive radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer.  A
1994 survey of practice patterns found that 95% of randomly-sampled urologists
considered surgery the treatment of choice for clinically localized prostate
cancer in men younger than 70 years.<Reference refidx="18"/>    As follow-up studies of large groups of men undergoing RP have accumulated, estimates of the number who recover functional erections (firm enough to allow penile-vaginal penetration on most occasions) range from 10% to 40%, with estimates of functional erections following external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) ranging from 15% to 33%.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/> Retrospective cohort studies have provided evidence indicating superior potency results with bilateral nerve-sparing surgical techniques.<Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/>  One research group suggested that much of the superiority of
nerve-sparing over standard surgical technique in preserving potency is an
artifact of selection bias.<Reference refidx="26"/>  The men selected to receive nerve-sparing
surgery are those with the best potential to recover adequate erections. A systematic literature review using MEDLINE and CANCERLIT from January 1997 to June 2003 concluded that patient selection and surgical technique are the major determinants of postoperative erectile function in patients receiving  treatment for localized prostate cancer.  For properly selected patients undergoing a nerve-sparing RP by an experienced surgeon, unassisted or medically assisted erections postoperatively should be achieved.<Reference refidx="27"/>
</Para><Para id="_17">Other studies suggest that 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy may be superior to RP in preserving erectile function.<Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/>  Rates of potency are typically in
the 30% to 60% range, with conformal therapy superior to older
techniques.<Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="34"/><Reference refidx="35"/><Reference refidx="36"/>  </Para><Para id="_370">  Men who are older and in poor health, however, are often
directed into radiation therapy, so that researchers often report 
posttreatment sexual function only for the subgroup that began with good
erections.  Furthermore, long-term follow-up is needed in comparing surgery with
radiation therapy because recovery of erectile function typically occurs within
a year or so after RP, whereas the damaging impact of radiation
on erectile function is slow and gradual, with declines still being observed as
long as 2 or 3 years after treatment.  A retrospective cohort study of men treated with either RP or EBRT revealed significantly greater prevalence of erectile dysfunction in the surgery group at 5 years after diagnosis (79.3% vs. 63.5%).<Reference refidx="37"/></Para><Para id="_371"> The mechanism of injury to erectile
function also differs between surgery and radiation therapy.   </Para><ItemizedList id="_372" Style="bullet" Compact="No">
     <ListItem>RP damages nerves that direct blood flow into the penis, ultimately
decreasing oxygenation of these tissues and increasing collagen deposits that

Patients who received brachytherapy alone had a 5-year potency rate of 76%, compared with a potency rate of 56% for those treated with brachytherapy and EBRT. Patients who received a combination of EBRT, neoadjuvant hormonal deprivation, and brachytherapy had a 5-year potency rate of 29%.<Reference refidx="41"/> </Para><Para id="_150">The etiology of erectile dysfunction following brachytherapy is unknown; however, radiation damage to nerve bundles and vascular structures has been proposed as a cause.<Reference refidx="41"/>   One  study investigated retrospectively the relationships between the dose of radiation to structures putatively involved in prostate brachytherapy–induced erectile dysfunction and incidence of postbrachytherapy erectile dysfunction.

A measured decrement in penile length was found in 71% of men after RP, which was more than 1 cm in 48% of patients at 3 months postsurgery.<Reference refidx="53"/> Similar findings were obtained in another study, with a decrease in the stretched penile length in 68% of patients and more than 15% decrease in 19% of patients.<Reference refidx="54"/> Penile length shortening has been shown to be independently associated with nerve preservation status and with postoperative erectile function outcome.</Para><SummarySection id="_279"><Title>Anatomical fibrotic changes</Title><Para id="_280">Anatomical fibrotic changes that showed significantly decreased elastic fibers and smooth muscle fiber content and increased collagen content have been demonstrated in comparisons of penile biopsies preoperatively and at 2 months and 12 months postoperatively. It is thought that the chronic absence of erectile activity leads to a state of cavernosal hypoxia, low oxygen tension, which favors the secretion of fibrogenic cytokines such as transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), while during erection the corporal smooth muscle is oxygenated. This results in the secretion of endogenous prostanoids (prostaglandin E1) which, in turn, inhibit fibrogenic cytokine production.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_281"><Title>Physiological-functional alterations</Title><Para id="_282">In addition to anatomical changes, there are also physiological-functional alterations. It is well recognized that even in the hands of an experienced surgeon using nerve-sparing surgery, some degree of nerve injury is likely to occur to the cavernosal nerves. Sympathetic hyperinnervation (termed by some <Emphasis>competitive sprouting</Emphasis>) refers to the concept that when autonomic nerves are injured, sympathetic fibers are biologically primed to recuperate from injury and regenerate more quickly, resulting in unantagonized sympathetic tone in the end organ. After cavernosal nerve injury, this phenomenon results in a penile hypertonic state. Any factors that result in reduced nitric oxide secretion or increased sympathetic tone, such as nerve injury after RP, may lead to decreased relaxation or distensibility of corporal smooth muscle and may lead to shortening.</Para><Para id="_283">Regardless of the exact mechanism of penile length alteration, the common underlying mechanism of penile shortening and long-term erectile dysfunction may be structural changes that result from a combination of neural injury–associated denervation resulting in smooth muscle degeneration and cavernosal hypoxia-induced collagen deposition.</Para><Para id="_284">Penile length changes can be divided into early and delayed:</Para><ItemizedList id="_285" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem><Strong>	Early changes.</Strong> Early changes occur in response to the neural injury during RP. The cavernosal nerves degenerate, and in the early phase—when sympathetic nerve function is in the ascendancy—the penis is contracted. Given that the penile smooth muscle is highly contractile in response to adrenergic tone, this results in a penis that patients often refer to as “being drawn back in the body.” This hypertonic state is most pronounced within the first 3 months to 6 months postsurgery. A clinical scenario supporting this is the circumcised man whose penis, soon after surgery, appears incompletely circumcised or even uncircumcised.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Delayed structural changes.</Strong>  Delayed structural changes  are more distressing to the patient, resulting from true irreversible structural alterations in the corporal smooth muscle. These structural changes most probably result from a combination of factors (as described above). The difference between these changes and early increased tone is shown by the reduced or absent penile stretch in the group with permanent smooth muscle alterations. It is easy to appreciate how these alterations affect not only length but also girth.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_326"><Title>Testicular cancer</Title><Para id="_327">Men diagnosed with testicular cancer find changes in sexual function particularly worrisome.  However, limited published data describing long-term  sexual function in men postorchiectomy are encouraging.  A Dutch study reported a decline in sexual function, including desire, during the first 3 months postsurgery, with function improving beyond baseline at 12 months.<Reference refidx="55"/>  In this study, being single was the main predictor of worse sexual functioning and/or less satisfaction with functioning at all time points.  The type of treatment (orchiectomy alone vs. orchiectomy plus chemotherapy or radiation therapy)  had no effect on sexual function.  Depression was predictive at baseline and at 3 months but not at 12 months.<Reference refidx="55"/></Para><Para id="_328">A French case-control study evaluated sexual outcomes in 106 men with testicular cancer who were 5 years postdiagnosis and disease free.<Reference refidx="56"/>  The control group was matched by age and geographic location.

There was, however, a significant difference between survivors and controls with regard to sexual enjoyment, desire (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .04), infertility (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001), and erectile dysfunction (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .05).  Loss of sexual activity and reduction of sexual intercourse did not  differ between groups.<Reference refidx="56"/></Para><Para id="_329">Similarly, a Norwegian study of more than 1,000 men with histories of testicular cancer (diagnosed and treated 4–18 years previously) found statistically significant differences on the Brief Male Sexual Function Inventory in the areas of erection, ejaculation, and desire in both younger men (aged 20–39 years) and older men (aged 40–59 years), compared with men of similar ages in the general population.<Reference refidx="57"/>  However, in contrast, the authors report that these statistically significant differences were small and not clinically meaningful.  Men who received chemotherapy in addition to retroperitoneal lymph node dissection reported more trouble with ejaculation but no trouble in  other sexual domains.  As in  the Dutch study described above, being single was the most important variable with respect to sexual problems.  In addition, increasing age was associated with worse sexual scores in this study.<Reference refidx="57"/></Para><Para id="_330">In summary, data suggest that although men with testicular cancer may report more problems with some aspects of sexual function, negative changes are mostly short term, with long-term function and activity being comparable to function and activity in the general population.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_101"><Title>Other pelvic tumors

addition, pelvic adhesions or scarring may contribute to dyspareunia after an

Sexual functioning was worse for women who received chemotherapy, regardless of the type of prior surgery (i.e., mastectomy or lumpectomy). These problems with sexual function were likely related to problems with vaginal lubrication and a change in menopausal status, both of which are more common in those receiving chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="73"/>  Because of concerns over causing recurrence of breast cancer, hormone replacement therapy is often not recommended for women who have become menopausal during treatment.<Reference refidx="74"/></Para><Para id="_24">In women with malignancies of other types, however, estrogen replacement

rejection.  One premorbid personality factor that may play a role in whether a
man or woman stays sexually active after cancer is the sexual self-schema
(i.e., whether an individual regards his or her own sexuality in a positive light).  Women
with negative sexual self-schemas were less likely to resume sex or have good
sexual function after treatment for gynecological cancer.<Reference refidx="105"/>  One of the most

treatment.  When therapeutic decisions are being made, providers may offer
education and information to patients, ideally with the partner present,
regarding known risks of sexual morbidity associated with cancer treatments. 
Oncology professionals   assist patients and their partners by asking
specific open-ended questions to validate the importance of sexual health
concerns, thus providing an environment in which the patient and couple are
encouraged and feel safe to express personal concerns. Assessment should be sensitive to the subtle ways in which changes in sexual function affect men’s self-image and masculine identity.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_404">  Providers may want examine their own thoughts and feelings regarding sexuality.  When providers
are not comfortable addressing issues of sexuality, referrals may be offered to alternate
resources.  Although some patients may not want to discuss their sexual health,
providers may offer the option, conveying that sex is an
appropriate topic to cover during future visits.</Para><Para id="_39">Because sexual function is one important aspect of quality of life, the follow-up
oncology visit is a key opportunity for health care providers to assess whether a
cancer patient is experiencing sexual problems.  Although it would be ideal if
an oncologist carried out the sexual assessment, time constraints and lack of 
training or comfort in discussing sexual issues often interfere with this goal. 
Furthermore, many people who have finished their cancer treatment have their routine follow-up care with a primary practitioner rather than an
oncology specialist.  
</Para><Para id="_405">At least in oncology settings, it may be helpful to
designate and train a member of the team, such as an oncology nurse or social
worker, as the expert on sexuality issues.  That provider can take
responsibility for asking about a variety of quality-of-life issues, including
relationships and sexuality.  A minimal sexual assessment might consist of
asking the following question: “Many cancer survivors notice changes or
problems in their sex lives after cancer treatment.  Do you have any problems
or concerns related to sexuality?”  Simple problems can be handled with
immediate reassurance or advice, but the oncology team may also build a
network of specialists willing to help cancer patients. This network of healthcare professionals includes:</Para><ItemizedList id="_406" Style="bullet">

</Para><SummarySection id="_41"><Title>General Factors Affecting Sexual Functioning Evaluated in Assessment</Title><Para id="_42">Once a possible sexual problem has been identified, the most important
assessment tool for the oncology health provider is a clinical interview with
an individual man or woman, or with a couple.<Reference refidx="13"/>  The following section describes
factors known to impact current sexual functioning .
</Para><SummarySection id="_102"><Title>Current sexual status</Title><Para id="_44">In the evaluation of an individual’s sexual function, the initial phase of
assessment serves to clarify the nature of the individual’s problem and/or
complaint.  Aspects of current sexual function include the frequency of experiencing spontaneous desire for sex;
ease of feeling subjective pleasure with sexual stimulation; energy for sexual activity; and signs of
physiological arousal, including the ability to achieve and maintain a firm
erection for a man, and vaginal expansion and lubrication for a woman.  The
ability to reach an orgasm is another important measure of sexual function.  It
is helpful to ask what types of sexual stimulation can trigger an orgasm (i.e.,
self-touch, use of a vibrator or shower massage, partner caressing, oral
stimulation, or intercourse).  Pain in the genital area that occurs with sexual
activity should be described in detail:</Para><ItemizedList id="_407" Style="bullet"><ListItem> Where is the pain? </ListItem><ListItem>What does it feel
like? </ListItem><ListItem> What kinds of sexual activity trigger it?</ListItem><ListItem> Does it happen every time? </ListItem><ListItem>How
long does it last?</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_408">When these lines of inquiry elicit a sexual problem, the
interviewer may ask when the problem began, especially whether a cancer
diagnosis or particular treatment occurred close in time to onset of the
problem.  Because many people who have cancer take prescription medications that
can interfere with sexual function, including antihypertensives,
antidepressants, or psychotropic medications, the interviewer may ask 
whether a new medication or change of dosage was prescribed at the problem’s onset.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_103"><Title>Premorbid sexual functioning
</Title><Para id="_46">An individual’s past (pre-illness) sexual development, preferences, and
experience are vital to assessment of sexual status.  The level of sexual
functioning before diagnosis and treatment, interest, satisfaction, and
importance of sexual functioning in the relationship all influence the
patient’s potential distress related to current sexual status.  Individuals who
have already experienced sexual difficulties may be especially vulnerable to
the effects of treatment.<Reference refidx="14"/>  Clinicians are careful not to make assumptions
regarding the patient’s previous sexual experience or the importance of sexual
expression.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_47"><Title>Psychosocial Aspects of Sexuality</Title><SummarySection id="_104"><Title>Relationship status
</Title><Para id="_49">The patient may or may not have an available partner at the time of diagnosis. 
Sexuality is taken no less seriously by the clinician or the patient if there is no partner.  For patients with a partner, the clinician may consider
and discuss the duration, quality, and stability of the relationship before
diagnosis.  Additionally, as many patients fear rejection and abandonment, the
clinician may inquire about the partner’s response to the illness and the
patient’s concerns about the impact of treatment on the partner.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/>  Partners
share many of the same reactions as patients in that their most significant
concerns typically relate to loss and fear of death.  Moreover, the partner’s
physical, sexual, and emotional health are considered relative to his/her
previous and current sexual status in a complete assessment.  A clinician
recognizes that most couples experience difficulty discussing sexual
preferences, concerns, and fears even under ideal circumstances and that sexual
communication problems tend to worsen with illness and threat of death.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_105"><Title>Psychological status
</Title><Para id="_51">The affective spectrum during cancer treatment ranges from disbelief to
clinical depression and typically changes over time.  Anxiety and depression
are the two most common affective disruptions among patients with cancer and
both have been found to have deleterious effects on sexual
functioning.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="18"/>  A clinician  will determine the following:

and any history of depression or other psychiatric disorder.</ListItem><ListItem> Previous
psychotherapy.</ListItem><ListItem> Treatment with psychotropic medication, and/or hospitalizations.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_410">Current use of psychotropic medications should also be reviewed with respect to
impact on sexual function.  Cancer treatment can produce changes to the body that
negatively impact body image and self-esteem.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="19"/>  Commonly, patients have
difficulty seeing themselves as sexually attractive during and after treatment. 
Identifying body-image disturbances is important to incorporate into goals of
care and rehabilitation.  Frequently, the couple experiences changes of social
roles during treatment.  An individual’s identity and sense of worth may be
threatened when role changes occur.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="15"/>  The partner’s participation in the
patient’s physical care often negatively impacts feelings of sexuality. 
Younger couples, more than older couples, may be vulnerable to problems with
playing alternative or new domestic roles and experiencing the myriad life
and financial stressors associated with treatment.<Reference refidx="4"/>
</Para><Para id="_339">To better illustrate the relationship between sexual health and psychological health, numerous sexual, physical, and psychological measures were examined in a  cross-sectional study of 186 partnered women who had gynecologic cancers.<Reference refidx="20"/>  Diagnoses included endometrial, ovarian/peritoneal, cervical, and vulvar cancers.  Most women had stage I to stage III cancers and were white, college educated, and married.  Their mean age was 55 years. Sexual morbidity was defined as a summed score of the following five factors:</Para><ItemizedList id="_340" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Appearance/desire (seven items).</ListItem><ListItem>Satisfaction/activity (six items).</ListItem><ListItem>Arousal (seven items).</ListItem><ListItem>Lubrication (four items).</ListItem><ListItem>Pain (four items).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_341">Sexual morbidity was moderately and significantly correlated with depression (<Emphasis>r</Emphasis> = 0.34) and traumatic stress (<Emphasis>r</Emphasis> = 0.30).  It was also low-moderately correlated with body image (<Emphasis>r</Emphasis> = 0.25); and with both components of the Medical Outcomes Study—Short Form 12: physical health (activity interference/general health, <Emphasis>r</Emphasis> = 0.34) and mental health (calm/downhearted, energy, emotional problems, <Emphasis>r</Emphasis> = 0.25).  Sexual morbidity was moderately to strongly and significantly correlated with fatigue (<Emphasis>r</Emphasis> = 0.44).  Sexual morbidity also contributed uniquely and significantly to depression, accounting for 48% of the variance; body change stress, 26% of the variance; and psychological quality of life, 31% of the variance.  The authors concluded that addressing sexual morbidity may improve psychological health.<Reference refidx="20"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_52"><Title>Medical Aspects of Sexuality</Title><Para id="_53">Past medical history with a particular emphasis
on other concurrent medical illness for which the patient is receiving
treatment will be assessed.  Comorbidity contributes to risk of sexual dysfunction and
additional decrease in social and role functioning, mental health, and health
perceptions.  Medical illnesses that impact the endocrine, vascular, and
nervous systems are all known to have a potential deleterious effect on the
sexual response cycle.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/></Para><Para id="_411">  Diabetes, hypertension, vascular disease,
multiple sclerosis, and many other disorders impact sexual function,
particularly the quality of erections in men.  Two textbooks extensively review
the impact of chronic illness and disability on sexual function.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="22"/> In addition, with the growing body of evidence demonstrating the severity and chronicity of fatigue in cancer survivors, the co-existence of cancer-related fatigue may be a major barrier.  In a descriptive cross-sectional study, fatigue was significantly and moderately correlated with all sexual functioning and satisfaction measures in 175 women with gynecologic cancer.<Reference refidx="23"/>  Therefore, assessing and addressing cancer-related fatigue, even in long-term survivors, is important.</Para><Para id="_299"> 
Lifestyle factors, including smoking and substantial alcohol consumption, are
also risk factors for sexual morbidity.  In men, cigarette smoking may induce
vasoconstriction and penile venous leakage.<Reference refidx="21"/> In large amounts, alcohol is a
strong sedative-hypnotic, producing decreased libido and transient erectile
dysfunction.<Reference refidx="21"/></Para><Para id="_54">Pharmacologic treatment for cancer and chronic illness in general is often a
necessary and integral component of health maintenance.  Some pharmacologic
treatments, however, may have direct or indirect deleterious effects on sexual
function through multiple physiologic and psychologic pathways.  Pharmacologic
agents that may negatively affect sexual response are addressed in the section
on pharmacologic effects.  (Refer to the section on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062859#_58" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/sexuality-fertility-women/sexuality-hp-pdq">Pharmacological Effects of Supportive Care Medications on Sexual Function</SummaryRef> in this summary for more information.)

</Para><SummarySection id="_412"><Title>Questionnaires and self-report scales</Title><Para id="_413">Brief questionnaires that measure sexual dysfunction may be helpful,

measuring aspects of sexual function and satisfaction in men.<Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/>   Sexual problems can also be identified with a briefer five-item scale, the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM), which is a validated self-report scale that can be used to identify erectile dysfunction in a variety of clinical settings.<Reference refidx="28"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_416"><Para id="_417"><Strong>Women</Strong>: For women, there are several brief measures with established psychometric properties that assess sexual functioning and satisfaction: the Brief Index of Sexual Functioning for Women (BISF-W, 22 items), the Sex History Form (SHF, 46 items), the Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (CSFQ, 35 items), the Derogatis Interview for Sexual Functioning (DISF/DISF-SR, 25 items), the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI, 19 items), and the Golombok-Rusk Inventory of Sexual Satisfaction (GRISS, 28 items).<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/></Para></SummarySection><Para id="_418">
These scales vary in their reliability, validity, method of attainment (i.e.,
patient vs. clinician rates; structured vs. semistructured), type and
number of symptoms assessed, and time frame of assessment.  To accurately
reflect changes over time, one must obtain systematic assessment of premorbid,
baseline, and follow-up levels of sexual function and satisfaction.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_419"><Title>Medical tests</Title><Para id="_420">In addition to paper-and-pencil self-report measures of sexuality, some medical

medications on sexual function in people with cancer.  People undergoing cancer
treatment are often treated with multiple medications that can cause diminished
desire or other difficulties in sexual functioning, which can add to the impact
of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy on sexuality.  Medications may
adversely affect one or more of the physiologic (i.e., vascular, hormonal, neurologic) mechanisms that underlie normal sexual function.  Drug therapy may also affect
sexual functioning indirectly through concomitant effects on mental alertness,
mood state, and/or social interactions.  The evaluation of sexual problems in
people with cancer must, therefore, be comprehensive and attuned to the
multiple etiologies of these difficulties.  The following sections may be
helpful in identifying some of the possible medication side effects, though
more than one may play a role in an individual.
</Para><SummarySection id="_60"><Title>Effect of Opioids on Sexual Function</Title><Para id="_61">Reduced libido is a well-known phenomenon for those using heroin or participating in a

examined the relationships among sexual functioning, chronic pain, opioid
therapy, and testosterone levels has been predominantly evaluated in men,
anecdotal clinical experience supports similar relationships in women.  Empirical support has been documented for women in a study that examined the
endocrine consequences of long-term intrathecal administration of opioids. 
Reduced libido was reported in 95% of the men and 68% of the women, with
significant reduction in serum LH for both groups and in serum testosterone for
the men.  All of the premenopausal women (n = 21) developed either amenorrhea or
an irregular menstrual cycle, with ovulation in only one woman.<Reference refidx="13"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]

known.  Sexuality is an important component of one’s quality of life,
especially for cancer survivors, but also for some people with advanced
disease.  Patients may report a history of changes in libido and sexual
dysfunction.  If these changes are distressing to the patient, serum total- and
free-testosterone levels and prolactin levels may be obtained.<Reference refidx="14"/>  Should the

impairment in depressed patients has been consistently confirmed in controlled
studies.<Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]  Continued recognition of the difficulty in
discerning the subjective complaints that are a part of the depressive
syndrome, the consequences of treatment, a pre-existing sexual dysfunction, or
a combination of these factors is needed.  Approximately one-third of depressed patients
without medication treatment report reduced sexual desire, anorgasmia, delayed
ejaculation, or erectile dysfunction.<Reference refidx="18"/>  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and lithium have all been associated with sexual dysfunction.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/>
</Para><Para id="_65">Sexual desire is mediated through the central nervous system by the
reception of sensory stimuli and the subsequent interpretation through the
limbic system and prefrontal cortex.<Reference refidx="21"/> Physiologically, serotonin is
stored in synaptosomal vesicles awaiting another impulse for release.  SSRIs
inhibit this uptake mechanism, which results in the pooling of serotonin in the
synaptic space.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/>  The excess serotonin causes the postsynaptic
receptors to down-regulate, resulting in decreased stimulation of the lower
erectile centers.  It is this action that is thought to be the principal
mechanism for SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction.
  Additionally, the hypothalamic and
preoptic nuclei contribute to the mediation of this process.  Serotonin
inhibits hypothalamic arousal postsynaptic receptors resulting in the release
of excitatory neurotransmitters.  These neurotransmitters are responsible
for the activation of the erectile centers of the spinal column.  Upon
activation of the erectile centers, subsequent erection, orgasm, and 
detumescence occur in males, whereas genital vasocongestion, vaginal lubrication,
and clitoral enlargement occur in females.<Reference refidx="23"/></Para><Para id="_66">There are no well-controlled studies that evaluate the effects of SSRIs on
sexual function within the oncology patient population.  There are several
studies, however, that have examined the effects of fluoxetine (Prozac),
fluvoxamine (Luvox), paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft) on sexual
function in patients being treated for depression or obsessive-compulsive
disorder.  There are few data regarding the prevalence of sexual
dysfunction with the use of citalopram (Celexa) in the treatment of depression. 
Sexual dysfunction from SSRIs has generally been reported to  affect
approximately 1% to 15% of patients in clinical trials of these medications in
physically healthy depressed patients.  Other studies, however, report
significantly higher rates of sexual dysfunction that may more accurately
reflect the incidence typical of clinical practice.  A large-scale
retrospective nonrandomized comparison trial of 596 psychiatric outpatients

fluoxetine (n = 298), venlafaxine (n = 36), or paroxetine (n = 265) found that
symptoms of sexual dysfunction were spontaneously reported by approximately 20%
of patients overall and were more common in men (23.4%) and married

Loss of libido and anorgasmia were more severe in women, though men reported
a greater frequency of sexual dysfunction.  The effects of SSRIs are dose
related and may vary among the group.  The incidence of sexual dysfunction
obtained by patient self-report does not appear to reflect the true incidence
of sexual dysfunction associated with antidepressant therapy, and systematic
inquiry by providers is needed as sexual dysfunction may be an unrecognized
cause of noncompliance.<Reference refidx="26"/>  Two critical reviews of the effects of SSRIs on
sexual function are available.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663089">Level of evidence: IV</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_67">For individuals with premature ejaculation, SSRIs provide an effective
treatment.  In a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of men with
lifelong rapid ejaculation, paroxetine delayed ejaculation the most, and
fluvoxamine delayed ejaculation the least.  Daily doses of 20 mg of paroxetine
and 20 mg of fluoxetine may be regarded as effective treatments for lifelong
rapid ejaculation.<Reference refidx="28"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]  Cancer patients treated with these medications in
clinical situations may have higher rates of anorgasmia, decreased sexual

compound the difficulties cancer patients encounter from multiple etiologies.
There are several possible interventions in the management of SSRI-induced
sexual dysfunction.  An obvious, though not always appropriate, possibility is
to decrease the dosage of the SSRI.  Altering the timing of SSRI
administration, either by delaying doses until after intercourse or dosing
immediately before intercourse,<Reference refidx="29"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663089">Level of evidence: IV</LOERef>] may be an effective intervention.  </Para><Para id="_435">There

possibility is the addition of another medication to help in the control of
SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction or consideration of another antidepressant
with less known sexual side effects.  In a  randomized, double-blind,
multicenter trial comparison of sustained-release bupropion (bupropion SR) and
sertraline, both were found to be similarly efficacious in the treatment of
outpatients with moderate-to-severe depression.  There was a significantly
greater percentage of sertraline-induced sexual dysfunction (63% and 41% of men
and women, respectively), compared with bupropion SR–induced sexual
dysfunction (15% and 7%, respectively).<Reference refidx="31"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_68">A definitive treatment has not been established for SSRI-induced sexual
dysfunction in males or females.  The oncology patient population presents with
significantly more obstacles in the management of sexual dysfunction, as
compared with patients whose symptoms are  being managed with SSRIs for depression alone.  The
etiology of sexual dysfunction in cancer patients is multifactorial and
complex.  The above data are intended to provide practitioners and patients
with possible options in the management of SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction.

with cancer experience,  few treatment programs for sexual dysfunction in
cancer patients have been designed or tested.  Programs that integrate medical and psychological modalities aimed at the treatment of sexual dysfunction in those who have had cancer are warranted.   Additionally, these programs must be cost-effective and accessible to people with cancer.</Para><Para id="_71">Many patients are fearful or anxious of their first sexual experience after
treatment and can often begin a pattern of sexual avoidance.  If the patient is
concerned about sending mixed signals to his or her partner, this can lead to
avoidance of general intimacy and touch.  The partner may also contribute
to the generalized avoidance of intimacy through his or her reluctance to initiate
any behavior that may be perceived as pressure to be more intimate or may contribute to any potential physical discomfort from greater expression of
physical intimacy.  Providers need to reassure patients and their significant
others that even when intercourse is difficult or impossible, their sex lives
are not over.  The couple can give and receive pleasure and satisfaction by
expressing their love and intimacy with their hands, mouths, tongues, and lips. 
Providers may encourage the couple to express affection in alternative ways
(e.g., hugging, kissing, nongenital touching) until they feel ready to resume sexual
activity.  The couple will be encouraged to communicate honest feelings,
concerns, and preferences.
</Para><Para id="_72">If a man cannot attain an erection firm enough for penetration,
and/or if intercourse is painful for a woman, some couples may be willing to find
alternative ways to bring each other to orgasm and express sexual intimacy. 
Sensate focus exercises of noncoital pleasuring,<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> based on principles of
sensuous massage, give couples an experience of sexual expression that allows
them to be physically close and intimate without pressure and anxiety that can
be associated with anticipation of intercourse.  The structure and ground rules
of sensate focus can help bypass performance anxiety (self-consciousness and
self-evaluation) and enable the couple to lose themselves in the current
experience of pleasurable touch.  These exercises also help the couple
communicate about potentially problematic or emotionally sensitive areas of the
body.  Providers may determine a couple’s openness to modification of their
sexual technique.  
</Para><Para id="_73">As many patients will experience anticipatory anxiety about re-establishing
sexual intimacy with their partner and potential uncertainty of their own
sexual response, the potential advantages of self-stimulation can be explored. 
Self-stimulation has the advantage of allowing the individual to become
comfortable with his/her sexual response and arousal without the added pressure
of performance anxiety commonly heightened by concern for his/her partner’s
pleasure, reactions, concerns, and/or fears.  For many individuals, a
cognitive reframing of masturbation to self-stimulation or self-pleasuring
allows the individual to accept this activity as part of the process in sexual
rehabilitation.  For others, this behavior may still be a resilient and
persistent taboo for cultural and religious reasons.
</Para><Para id="_74">For those couples who wish to have sexual intercourse, sexual positions that
place no weight on a scar or ostomy and positions that allow  better
control of depth of penetration can be explored.  The side-by-side position
(spooning) in which the man is behind the woman, or the L-shaped position, with
both partners lying down, torsos at right angles and legs entwined, are two
possibilities.  Comprehensive pamphlets on sexuality and cancer, for both men
<Reference refidx="3"/> and women,<Reference refidx="4"/>       provide illustrations of sexual positions and other 
self-help information.
</Para><Para id="_75">For patients with colostomies or ileostomies, pamphlets are available from
national organizations related to resuming sexual activity including topics
such as sex and the female ostomate, sex and the male ostomate, and gay and
lesbian ostomates.  Providers can educate patients on limiting food intake
before anticipated sexual activity, watching the types of food consumed, and
planning times for intimacy when a bowel movement is less likely.  Although the
ostomy pouch is typically changed when about one-third full, patients should be
taught to empty the pouch sooner when anticipating sexual intimacy.  Patients may fear that the ostomy bag will interfere with
sexual intimacy, become dislodged, or cause damage to the stoma.  An empty and
flat ostomy bag will not become dislodged from the stoma and can be rolled up
or taped down so that it will not get in the way of sexual intimacy. 
Decorative covers may also be worn.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663089">Level of evidence: IV</LOERef>]  A wide selection of products
for ostomates is available, including disposable pouches, reusable pouches that
empty from the bottom or top while still attached, pouches with filters to
control odors, and pouches that hang sideways instead of down for physical
activity.  Patients concerned about potential odor can use deodorant tablets or
liquids in the bottom of the pouch or as recommended by the manufacturer.<Reference refidx="6"/>
</Para><Para id="_76">Providers can help educate couples by offering practical suggestions to
overcome changes in responsiveness to sexual stimulation.  Couples should allow
plenty of time for sexual expression with sufficient foreplay to develop the
fullest possible sexual arousal.  For some couples, early morning may be a good
restful time for sexual expression.  Conditions that facilitate sexual pleasure
should be explored and may include relaxation, dreams, fantasy, deep breathing,
and recalling positive experiences with the partner.
</Para><Para id="_154">Erection problems are the most common sexual dysfunction for which men seek
help after cancer treatment.  Many men with erectile dysfunction are able to
have an orgasm with oral or manual stimulation; many partners are satisfied and
orgasmic with noncoital stimulation.  If the desire for intercourse remains,
there are several treatment options available for erectile dysfunction,
depending on the cause and degree of dysfunction.  Only a small percentage of
men with erection problems seek help.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_331">With the advent of
sildenafil (Viagra), a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor used to treat erection problems,<Reference refidx="9"/> the
percentage of men who seek treatment for erection problems has
increased.  Despite the publicity about the effectiveness of sildenafil, the drug
works best in men with the mildest forms of erectile dysfunction.  Many men
will be unable to achieve adequate erections by taking this drug alone.  The use of sildenafil  enables about 72% of men with nerve-sparing prostatectomy and 15% of men with non–nerve-sparing prostatectomy to achieve erections sufficient for vaginal intercourse.  </Para><Para id="_436">Radical prostatectomy can result in nerve injury, in addition to vascular and smooth muscle damage.  Injury and prolonged flaccidity of the penis can result in  hypo-oxygenation of the penile tissue, further complicating structural integrity and compromising future erectile function.<Reference refidx="10"/>  The process of healing after surgery takes approximately 3 to 6 months, and full recovery can be expected at 1 year postsurgery.  However, during this time, it is important for men to continue to have erections to keep the tissue healthy with adequate blood flow and to improve their future ability to have adequate erections.   Therefore, early penile rehabilitation is recommended.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_332">  In one nonrandomized study, 84 men who had undergone nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy could choose whether to start early rehabilitation or to wait.<Reference refidx="12"/>  In this study, <Emphasis>early</Emphasis> rehabilitation was defined as beginning activities to achieve erections within 6 months of radical prostatectomy, while <Emphasis>delayed</Emphasis> rehabilitation was defined as starting such activities more than 6 months after radical prostatectomy.  Rehabilitation consisted of the use of sildenafil citrate, 100 mg, on four occasions.  If erection sufficient for vaginal penetration was not achieved, then men were encouraged to use penile injections to obtain erections.  Those who responded well to sildenafil citrate continued using this agent.  Forty-eight men chose early rehabilitation, and 36 men chose delayed rehabilitation.  The men were matched for age, comorbidities, and baseline erectile function, with a mean age of 58 years.  Outcomes were evaluated with the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and were assessed presurgery and at 1 and 2 years postsurgery.  Trends for better scores on the IIEF were seen at 1 year, but statistically significant differences were not realized until year 2, with significantly more men in the early rehabilitation arm having unassisted functional erections (48% vs. 33%) and more men in the early group having functional erections with sildenafil (76% vs. 45%).  Twenty-four percent of men in the early rehabilitation group had normal erectile function scores as measured by the IIEF, compared to 8% of men in the delayed rehabilitation group.<Reference refidx="12"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] Some data suggest that about 12% of sildenafil responders lose efficacy by 3 years.<Reference refidx="13"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663087">Level of evidence: III</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_333">In a

the man’s partner in prompting him to try a treatment or to keep on using it is
also poorly understood.  When erectile functioning is impaired, counseling
will initially focus on obtaining sexual pleasure and satisfaction without
erections or intercourse.  For men with postsurgical erectile dysfunction,
there is the possibility for improved function over time as nerves may
potentially regenerate for up to 2.5 years after surgery.<Reference refidx="6"/>

clitoral therapy device (EROS-CTD) creates a gentle suction over the clitoris
to increase blood flow and sensation.  This device is only available
by prescription and is clinically indicated for the treatment of female sexual
dysfunction.  It is expected to be particularly effective in postmenopausal
women, women who have had hysterectomies, and those women who have 
surgically induced menopause.<Reference refidx="53"/> The efficacy of EROS therapy has been supported by several small pilot studies,<Reference refidx="54"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663087">Level of evidence: III</LOERef>]<Reference refidx="55"/><Reference refidx="56"/> one of which specifically examined its efficacy in alleviating the symptoms of sexual dysfunction among women with a history of irradiated cervical cancer.<Reference refidx="55"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] Three months posttherapy, this study found statistically significant improvements in all domains evaluated, which included increased sexual desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, sexual satisfaction, and reduced pain. Additionally, follow-up gynecological examinations revealed improved vaginal elasticity, mucosal color, and moisture and decreased bleeding and ulceration. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to fully assess the benefits of EROS therapy.</Para><Para id="_80">More specific information for the evaluation and treatment of female sexual

</Para><Para id="_81">For both men and women, a persistent and complex sexual problem is loss of
desire for sex after cancer treatment.  In men who have not had prostate cancer
and have clinically low levels of serum testosterone, replacement by injection
or patch is often effective in restoring normal sexual function.  Testosterone
replacement tends to have little effect, however, if given to a man whose own
hormone levels fall within the normal range.  Safety, dosage, and delivery
systems for androgen replacement in women need to be studied. Numerous studies have evaluated the use of transdermal testosterone in various populations.<Reference refidx="59"/><Reference refidx="60"/><Reference refidx="61"/><Reference refidx="62"/><Reference refidx="63"/><Reference refidx="64"/><Reference refidx="65"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]  These populations include women who have hypoactive sexual desire disorder who have had oophorectomies, who are naturally postmenopausal, who are premenopausal, and who have a history of cancer.  These studies used doses ranging from 150 μg to 10 mg daily.  Most of the studies in women have used concomitant estradiol supplementation if estrogen levels fell outside the normal premenopausal range and found that testosterone supplementation significantly improved libido outcomes.</Para><Para id="_226">Only two published studies have evaluated transdermal testosterone for libido in postmenopausal women without estrogen supplementation.  One of these studies was in cancer survivors,<Reference refidx="66"/> and the other was in postmenopausal women who were diagnosed with hypoactive sexual desire disorder.<Reference refidx="67"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]  The clinical trial in cancer survivors showed that in 150 female cancer survivors randomly assigned to receive either 10 mg of transdermal testosterone daily or placebo for 4 weeks, there was no statistically significant difference in improvement in sexual desire as measured by a validated sexual function scale, the Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire, despite the fact that androgen levels improved significantly in the women receiving the testosterone but remained unchanged in the women receiving placebo. The other clinical trial  randomly assigned 814 postmenopausal women to receive either 150 µg or 300 µg of transdermal testosterone versus placebo for a year (without estrogen), with an efficacy endpoint of 24 weeks looking at satisfying sexual episodes captured in activity logs.  Authors reported a significant improvement of about one additional satisfying sexual episode over a 4-week period in the 300-µg group compared with placebo, but not in the 150-µg group.  Upon further analysis, it was found that women who had experienced surgical menopause, having had their ovaries removed, did not benefit from this intervention.  This raises the questions of whether ovarian status in women who have been treated for cancer with chemotherapy is more like surgical or natural menopause, and whether the chemotherapy-induced menopausal ovary functions with an active stroma or has no activity after chemotherapy, akin to surgical removal.   Research in this area is needed to better understand the entire hormonal milieu of women after cancer treatment and how all of the hormone changes work together to impact symptoms. Therefore, it is not clear that testosterone alone, in the absence of estrogen, can positively impact libido.</Para><Para id="_227">For women who have
breast cancer, the safety of giving androgens is unknown.  Serum androgens can
be aromatized to estrogen. Data from epidemiologic studies suggest there may be an increased risk of breast cancer with higher concentrations of endogenous androgens.<Reference refidx="68"/>  <Reference refidx="69"/> However, endogenous androgens present over a life span do not equal exogenous androgen supplementation for a woman with low androgen concentrations.  One small study evaluating the effects  of testosterone supplementation on breast tissue found that the addition of testosterone to estrogen and progesterone inhibited the breast proliferation exhibited in the group that received estrogen, progesterone, and placebo.<Reference refidx="70"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] Furthermore, one case-controlled study in more than 8,000 women found that the use of exogenous testosterone for 4 years did not result in an increased incidence of breast cancer, despite the fact that 83% of testosterone users were also using estrogen replacement compared with only 15% of the age-matched controls.<Reference refidx="71"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663087">Level of evidence: III</LOERef>]   Therefore, many unanswered questions remain about sufficient androgen levels for adequate sexual function as well as short- and long-term safety.  To date, there are no compelling data to support the use of testosterone alone to improve libido in women who are estrogen deficient.
</Para><Para id="_82">Because loss of desire often is multifactorial, an approach that includes
psychological assessment and treatment is usually optimal.  An experienced
mental health professional can rule out a mood disorder as a factor in loss of
desire and can explore the interactions of factors such as the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_443" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Changes in
relationship dynamics.</ListItem><ListItem>Loss of physical well-being.</ListItem><ListItem>Changes in sexual 
self-concept.</ListItem><ListItem>Negative body image.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_444">The effects of prescription medications,
chemical dependency, or hormonal abnormalities can be recognized and targeted
for change.  Unfortunately, there is no true aphrodisiac medication that can
restore sexual desire in the presence of a normal hormonal environment.
</Para><Para id="_83">In general, a variety of treatment modalities are available for sexual
dysfunction after cancer.  For many problems, providing information and
suggestions for behavior change in a self-help format may be sufficient. 
Education can be provided via books,<Reference refidx="38"/> pamphlets,<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> CD-ROMs, videos, peer counselors,<Reference refidx="72"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] or
Internet interactions.  For men and women with more complex and severe
problems, professional intervention will be more effective.  Future research
needs to explore which treatment components are most effective with particular
groups of patients. A psychoeducational intervention was evaluated in women with a history of breast cancer.<Reference refidx="73"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]  The intervention content addressed the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_306" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Sexual anatomy.</ListItem><ListItem>Body image.</ListItem><ListItem>Attitudes and behavior.</ListItem><ListItem>Communication.</ListItem><ListItem>Ways to enhance sexual function.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_307">The intervention was delivered in person, in groups,  at 2-hour sessions over a 6-week period. The  primary outcome was the Mental Health Index, providing a measure of anxiety, depression, loneliness, distress, well-being, and positive affect.  Other outcomes included  sexual satisfaction, self-image, and functioning, such as dyspareunia.   Women were identified through a mailed survey and randomly assigned ahead of time either to the intervention or to the control group (written material only).  Women randomly assigned to the intervention were then invited to participate.  Of 284 women assigned to the intervention, only 83 agreed to participate; of those, only 72 attended any of the sessions.  The most common reasons for declining participation were inconvenient time and/or location, being too busy, or feeling that the intervention was not needed.   One hundred twenty-seven women were randomly assigned to the control group,  and follow-up was reported for 98 of them.<Reference refidx="73"/></Para><Para id="_310">Results from this study are presented for three groups:</Para><ItemizedList id="_308" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Control group.</ListItem><ListItem>Intervention nonparticipants.</ListItem><ListItem>Intervention participants.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_309">An intent-to-treat analysis showed no significant differences between groups for the Mental Health Index.  However, there was an intervention effect for general satisfaction with sex.  An as-treated analysis did suggest improvement on the Mental Health Index, with women who reported more distress at baseline experiencing more benefit.<Reference refidx="73"/> This study provides data to support the idea that interventions focusing on psychosocial and cognitive factors may be an important component of interventions to improve emotional and sexual outcomes. However, more research is needed  to develop psychoeducational interventions that are less time intensive, can be disseminated easily, and  are more readily accepted by cancer survivors.</Para><Para id="_300">  Sexual counseling can be provided for individuals,
couples, or groups.  The effectiveness of these different formats has not been
compared for people with cancer.  It is also not known whether brief counseling
can enhance the impact of medical treatments, such as those used to overcome
erectile dysfunction or dyspareunia.
There is limited research about the impact of support groups on sexual outcomes for men with prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="74"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]  It is  likely that associations between better outcomes and participation in support groups reflect baseline sociographic and clinical differences between those who participate in support groups and those who do not.</Para><SummarySection id="_TrialSearch_69_sid_5"><Title>Current Clinical Trials</Title><Para id="_TrialSearch_69_13">Check NCI’s list of cancer clinical trials for U.S. supportive and palliative care trials about

Age is an important factor, and the
possibility of gonadal recovery improves with the length of time off
chemotherapy.  The germinal epithelium of the adult testis is more susceptible
to damage than that of the prepubertal testis.<Reference refidx="3"/>  The evidence to date
(largely from adjuvant studies) suggests that patients older than 35 to 40
years are most susceptible to the ovarian effects of chemotherapy.  The
ovaries of younger women can tolerate greater doses.<Reference refidx="4"/>  Predicting the outcome
for any individual patient is difficult, as the course of ovarian functioning
following chemotherapy is variable.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Relative risk of ovarian failure and
testicular damage from cytotoxic agents has been studied, and the alkylating
agents have subsequently been shown to be  damaging to fertility.

less gonadotoxic than those used for Hodgkin lymphoma.<Reference refidx="3"/> The addition of adjuvant endocrine therapy in patients older than 40 years was more likely to result in permanent chemotherapy-related amenorrhea.<Reference refidx="10"/>  The effects of
chemotherapy on testicular function have also been widely studied in patients
with testicular cancer.  One review reported that more than half of the patients with testicular germ cell cancer showed impaired spermatogenesis
before undergoing cytotoxic treatment.  Permanent infertility is ultimately
defined by dose of cisplatin in these patients.  At doses lower than 400 mg/m<Superscript>2</Superscript>,
long-term effects on endocrine function and sperm production are unlikely to
occur.  Higher doses would be expected to cause long-term endocrine-gonadal
dysfunction.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_152">Although chemotherapy causes ovarian damage, there appears to be no risk of toxicity to future offspring of women treated with these agents before pregnancy.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_89"><Title>Radiation</Title><Para id="_90">When the testes are exposed to radiation, sperm count begins to decrease and,
depending on the dosage, temporary or permanent sterility may result.<Reference refidx="4"/> 
Men who receive radiation to the abdominal or pelvic region may still regain
partial or full sperm production, depending on the extent of injury to the
testes.  Unlike the germinal epithelium, Leydig cell function may be more prone
to damage from irradiation in prepubertal life than in adulthood.<Reference refidx="3"/> Testicular radiation with doses higher than 20 Gy is associated with Leydig cell dysfunction in prepubertal boys, while Leydig cell function is usually preserved with doses of as much as 30 Gy in sexually mature males.<Reference refidx="12"/>  Exposing
the testes to ionizing radiation at a dose lower than 6 Gy causes disturbances of
spermatogenesis and altered spermatocytes with recovery periods dependent on
dose;<Reference refidx="4"/> doses higher than 6 Gy cause permanent infertility by killing off all stem
cells.<Reference refidx="13"/>
</Para><Para id="_450">  For patients with testicular germ cell cancer, using modern
radiation techniques (radiation doses &lt;30 Gy to the para-aortic field) and
testis shielding providing testis scatter radiation (&lt;30 Gy), radiation-induced
impairment of fertility is very unlikely.<Reference refidx="11"/> Sperm counts are typically lowest at 4 to 6 months posttreatment; return to pretreatment levels usually occurs in 10 to 24 months, with longer periods required for recovery after higher doses.<Reference refidx="9"/> Total-body irradiation (TBI) as a conditioning regimen for stem cell transplantation causes permanent gonadal failure in approximately 80% of men.<Reference refidx="14"/>  For men, gonadal toxicity can be
evidenced by the following three measurements:</Para><ItemizedList id="_451" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem> Testicular biopsy.</ListItem><ListItem>Serum hormone
assays (levels).</ListItem><ListItem>Semen analysis.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_452">  When male infertility is the result of
abnormal hormone production, the use of hormone manipulation may lead to the
return of sperm production.<Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Para id="_91">For women, a radiation dose of 5 Gy to 20 Gy administered to the ovary is sufficient to
completely impair gonadal function, regardless of the patient’s age; a dose of
30 Gy provokes premature menopause in 60% of women younger than 26 years.<Reference refidx="16"/> In a study of children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer, female 5-year survivors were significantly less likely to have ever been pregnant when compared with their siblings.  Survivors who received hypothalamic/pituitary radiation doses of 30 Gy or higher or ovarian/uterine radiation doses higher than 5 Gy and those who were treated with lomustine or cyclophosphamide were less likely to have ever been pregnant.<Reference refidx="17"/> Women who are older than 40 years when undergoing treatment have a smaller pool of remaining oocytes and require only 5 to 6 Gy to produce permanent ovarian failure. TBI, when used before stem cell transplantation, is associated with more than 90% permanent gonadal failure in women overall and an incidence of pregnancy less than 3%.<Reference refidx="9"/> The outlook for recovery of ovarian function before puberty is more favorable, particularly if radiation is delivered in several fractions.<Reference refidx="14"/> Measurement of gonadal toxicity in women is more difficult to assess
due to the relative inaccessibility of the ovary to biopsy (which would require
laparoscopy).  Therefore, the criteria most commonly used to determine ovarian failure are the following:

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_92"><Title>Preventive Strategies</Title><Para id="_93">For women, studies <Reference refidx="18"/> have shown that movement of the ovaries out of the
field of radiation (ovariopexy)—laterally, toward the iliac crest, or
behind the uterus—may help preserve fertility when high doses of radiation
therapy are being applied.  By relocating the ovaries laterally it is possible
to shield them during radiation of the para-aortic and femoral lymph nodes.<Reference refidx="4"/> 
Pelvic radiation, however, still provokes an irradiation of the ovary of 5% to 10%, even if transposed outside the irradiation area.<Reference refidx="16"/>  Similar prevention
strategies are available for men.  When possible, lead shields are used to
protect the testes.<Reference refidx="4"/>

When options for patients are being investigated, critical review is needed.</Para><Para id="_96">These options may not be appropriate for all patients.  Counseling is an
important part of the decision-making process for patients.  Thinking through
these decisions at a time when patients are struggling with issues of life and
potential death are often difficult.  Patients need to consider costs, stress,
time, emotions, and potential inclusion of another individual in the pregnancy
process (i.e., a surrogate).  For many patients, the financial costs associated
with <Emphasis>in vitro</Emphasis> fertilization and subsequent embryo cryopreservation is cost
prohibitive.  Consideration also needs to be given to the current rate of
failure for <Emphasis>in vitro</Emphasis> fertilization procedures and the potential adverse effect
of malignancy on sperm parameters.<Reference refidx="25"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663087">Level of evidence: III</LOERef>]  A retrospective analysis, with a

sperm extraction incorporates the removal of testicular parenchyma with
processing and isolation of individual sperm cells.  This allows for ICSI in azoospermic men.   In a retrospective
study, 15 of 23 men who were azoospermic after receiving chemotherapy had
retrievable testis sperm  leading to successful fertilization.    Pregnancies occurred in 31% of cycles.

ejaculation. In the United States, ephedrine sulfate is most often used; in
Europe, imipramine is also used.  Pharmacologic agents can also be used
to induce an ejaculation (i.e., intrathecal neostigmine or subcutaneous
physostigmine).  When medication does not work, several other techniques are
available and may be recommended, including vibratory stimulation,
electroejaculation, direct aspiration of fluid from the vas deferens, perineal
needle stimulation, and hypogastric-nerve stimulation.  Further review of these
