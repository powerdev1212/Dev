the United States in 2015, and an estimated  8,650 people will die of the
disease.<Reference refidx="1"/> This form of cancer accounts for about 4% of cancers in men.<Reference refidx="1"/> 
 The overall annual incidence in the United States is about 11.9 per 100,000 men and women; the incidence rate is highest in individuals aged 65 years and older.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_59">  From 2007 to 2011, incidence rates increased by 1.3% per year in white men and were stable  in women. Among
blacks, incidence rates declined by 3.0% per year in men and by 1.4% per
year in women.<Reference refidx="1"/> The incidence has  been increasing for oral cancers related to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.   About 60% of oral/pharyngeal cancers are moderately advanced (regional stage) or metastatic at the time of diagnosis.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_62">The estimated annual worldwide number of incident oral cancers is about 275,000, with an approximately 20-fold variation geographically.<Reference refidx="3"/>   South and Southeast Asia (India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Bangladesh), France, and Brazil have particularly high rates.  In most countries, men have higher rates of oral cancer than women (due to tobacco use) and higher rates of lip cancer (due to sunlight exposure from outdoor occupations).<Reference refidx="3"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_73"><Title>Risk factors</Title><Para id="_60">The primary risk factors for oral cancer in American men and women are tobacco
(including smokeless tobacco) and alcohol use. Infection with HPV-16 has
been associated with an excess risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of
the oropharynx.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_64"><Title>Evidence of Benefit Associated With Screening </Title><Para id="_61">No population-based screening programs for oral cancers have been implemented in developed countries, although opportunistic screening or screening as part of a periodic health examination has been advocated.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>   There are different methods of screening for oral cancers. Oral cancer occurs in a region of the body that is generally accessible to
physical examination by the patient, the dentist, and the physician;    and   visual examination is the most common method used to detect visible lesions. Other methods have been used to augment clinical detection of oral lesions and include toluidine blue, brush biopsy, and fluorescence staining.</Para><Para id="_63"> An inspection of the oral cavity is often part of a physical examination in a dentist's or physician's office.  It has
been pointed out that high-risk individuals visit their medical doctors more
frequently than they visit their dentists. Although physicians are more likely to provide risk-factor counseling (such as tobacco cessation), they are less likely than dentists to perform an oral cancer examination.<Reference refidx="7"/> Overall, only a fraction (~20%) of Americans receive an oral cancer examination.  Black patients,    Hispanic patients, and those who have a lower level of education are less likely to have such an examination, perhaps because they   lack access to medical care.<Reference refidx="7"/>    An
oral examination often includes looking for leukoplakia and erythroplakia
lesions, which can progress to cancer.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/>  One  study has shown that direct  fluorescence visualization (using a simple hand-held device in the operating room) could identify subclinical high-risk fields with cancerous or precancerous changes extending up to 25 mm beyond the primary tumor in 19 of 20 patients undergoing oral surgery for invasive or <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> squamous cell tumors.<Reference refidx="10"/> However, this finding has not yet been tested in a screening setting.    Data suggest that molecular
markers may be useful in the prognosis of these premalignant oral
lesions.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_65">The routine examination of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients can lead to detection of earlier stage cancers and premalignant lesions. There is no definitive evidence, however, to show that this screening can reduce oral cancer mortality, and there are no randomized controlled trials (RCT) in any Western or other low-risk populations.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Para id="_66">In a single RCT of screening versus usual care, 13 geographic clusters in the Trivandrum district of Kerala, India, were randomly assigned to receive systematic oral visual screening by trained health workers (seven screened clusters, six control clusters) every 3 years for four screening rounds during the period 1996 to 2008.  During a 15-year follow-up period, there were 138 deaths from oral cancer in the screening group with a cause–specific mortality rate of 15.4 per 100,000 person-years, and 154 deaths in the control group with a  mortality rate of 17.1 per  100,000  person-years (relative risk [RR] = 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69–1.12).  In a subset analysis restricted to tobacco or alcohol users, the mortality rates were 30 and 39 per 100,000 person-years, respectively (RR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60–0.97).  There was no apparent adjustment of the CIs for the cluster design.  In another subgroup analysis, mortality hazard ratios were calculated for groups defined by number of times screened, but the inappropriate comparison in each case was to the control group of the whole study. No data on treatment of oral cancers were presented.<Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/></Para><Para id="_67">Aside from the issues of generalizability to other populations and lack of an overall statistically significant result in cause-specific mortality, interpretation of the results is made difficult by serious lacks in methodologic  detail about the randomization process, allocation concealment, adjustment for clustering effect, and information about treatment.  The total number of clusters randomized was small, and there were different distributions of income and household possessions between the two study arms.  Withdrawals and dropouts were not clearly described.  In summary, the sole randomized trial does not provide solid evidence of a cause-specific mortality benefit associated with systematic oral cavity visual examination.</Para><SummarySection id="_75"><Title>Adjunctive techniques to visual examination</Title><Para id="_76">Techniques such as toluidine blue staining, brush biopsy/cytology, or fluorescence imaging as the primary screening tool or as an adjunct for screening have not been shown to have superior sensitivity and specificity for visual examination alone or to yield better health outcomes.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="20"/>   In a RCT conducted in Keelung County, Taiwan, 7,975 individuals at high risk of oral cancer due to cigarette smoking or betel quid chewing were randomly assigned to receive a one-time oral cancer examination after gargling with toluidine blue or a blue placebo dye.<Reference refidx="21"/>   The positive test rates were 9.5% versus 8.3%, respectively, (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .047).  The detection of premalignant lesions was not statistically different (rate ratio = 1.05; 95% CI, 0.74–1.41).  The number of overall oral cancers diagnosed within the short follow-up period of 5 years was too small for valid comparison (six in each group).</Para><Para id="_69">The operating characteristics of the various techniques used as an adjunct to oral visual examination are not well established.  A systematic literature review of toluidine blue, a variety of other visualization adjuncts, and cytopathology in the screening setting revealed a very broad range of reported sensitivities, specificities, and positive predictive values when using biopsy confirmation as the gold standard outcome.<Reference refidx="22"/>   In part, this was due to varying study populations, sample size and settings, as well as criteria for positive-clinical examinations and for scoring a biopsy as positive.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_70"><Title>Evidence of Harm Associated With Screening</Title><Para id="_71">Harms associated with screening for oral cancer are poorly studied in any quantifiable way.<Reference refidx="15"/>  However, there are some unavoidable harms that would be associated with routine screening, including:</Para><ItemizedList id="_77" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Detection of cases that are already incurable, leading to increased morbidity.</ListItem><ListItem>Unnecessary treatment of lesions that would not have progressed (overdiagnosis).</ListItem><ListItem>Psychologic consequences of false-positive tests.<Reference refidx="23"/></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_72">An additional potential harm is misdiagnosis and resulting under- or over-treatment, given the subjective pathology judgments in reading biopsies of oral lesions.  When 87 biopsy diagnoses of oral lesions were compared between 21 local pathologists and double-reading by  two of three central pathologists in a multicenter study of patients with prior upper aerodigestive tract cancers, agreement was only fair-to-good (kappa weighted-statistic = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.45–0.72).<Reference refidx="24"/>   In a bivariate categorization of carcinoma <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> plus carcinoma versus less serious lesions, the agreement was poor, but with very wide CIs  (kappa-statistic = 0.39; 95% CI, -0.12–0.97).  The investigators in the same study analyzed an agreement between the local and central pathologists on clinically normal tissue adjacent to 67 biopsied clinically-suspicious lesions.  The agreement on clinically normal tissue was better than for visibly abnormal lesions, but still not in the excellent range (kappa weighted-statistic = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.64–0.86).<Reference refidx="25"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">American Cancer Society: Cancer Facts and Figures 2015.
