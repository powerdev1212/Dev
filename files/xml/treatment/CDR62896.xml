cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team
of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during
childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the primary care physician, pediatric surgical subspecialists, radiation
oncologists, pediatric medical oncologists/hematologists, rehabilitation
specialists, pediatric nurse specialists, social workers, and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
that will achieve optimal survival and quality of life. (Refer to the PDQ <ExternalRef xref="http://cancer.gov/cancerinfo/pdq/supportivecare/">Supportive and Palliative Care</ExternalRef> summaries for specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer.) </Para><Para id="_122">Guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of children with
cancer have been outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics.<Reference refidx="2"/>  At these
pediatric cancer centers, clinical trials are available for most 
types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity to
participate in these trials is offered to most patients/families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents with cancer are generally designed to
compare potentially better therapy with therapy that is currently accepted as
standard.  Most of the progress made in identifying curative therapies
for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.  Information
about ongoing clinical trials is available from the <ExternalRef xref="http://cancer.gov/clinicaltrials">NCI Web site</ExternalRef>. </Para><Para id="_142">Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer.<Reference refidx="1"/> Between 1975 and 2010, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%. For acute myeloid leukemia, the 5-year survival rate increased over the same time from less than 20% to 68% for children younger than 15 years and from less than 20% to 57% for adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close follow-up because cancer therapy side effects may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000343584" url="/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq">Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer</SummaryRef> for specific information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors.)</Para><SummarySection id="_153"><Title>Myeloid Leukemias in Children</Title><Para id="_154">Approximately 20% of childhood leukemias are of myeloid origin and they represent a spectrum of hematopoietic malignancies.<Reference refidx="3"/>  The majority of myeloid leukemias are acute, and the remainder include chronic and/or subacute myeloproliferative disorders such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Myelodysplastic syndromes occur much less frequently in children than in adults and almost invariably represent clonal, preleukemic conditions.</Para><Para id="_168">Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is defined as a clonal disorder caused by malignant transformation of a bone marrow–derived, self-renewing stem cell or progenitor, which demonstrates a decreased rate of self-destruction as well as aberrant, and usually limited,  differentiation capacity.  These events lead to increased accumulation in the bone marrow and other organs by these malignant myeloid cells.  To be called acute, the bone marrow usually must include greater than 20% leukemic blasts, with some exceptions as noted in subsequent sections.</Para><Para id="_169"> CML represents the most common of the chronic myeloproliferative disorders in childhood, although it accounts for only 10% to 15% of childhood myeloid leukemia.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Although CML has been diagnosed in very young children, most patients are aged 6 years and older.  CML is a clonal panmyelopathy that involves all hematopoietic cell lineages.  While the white blood cell (WBC) count can be extremely elevated, the bone marrow does not show increased numbers of leukemic blasts during the chronic phase of this disease.  CML is nearly always characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome, a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (i.e., t(9;22)) resulting in fusion of the <GeneName>BCR</GeneName> and <GeneName>ABL</GeneName> genes.  Other chronic myeloproliferative syndromes, such as polycythemia vera and essential thrombocytosis, are extremely rare in children.   </Para><Para id="_170"> JMML represents the most common myeloproliferative syndrome observed in young children.  JMML occurs at a median age of 1.8 years and characteristically presents with hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, fever, and skin rash along with an elevated WBC count and increased circulating monocytes.<Reference refidx="4"/> In addition, patients often have an elevated hemoglobin F, hypersensitivity of the leukemic cells to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), monosomy 7, and leukemia cell mutations in a gene involved in RAS pathway signaling (e.g., <GeneName>NF1</GeneName>, <GeneName>KRAS/NRAS</GeneName>, <GeneName>PTPN11</GeneName>, or <GeneName>CBL</GeneName>).<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/> </Para><Para id="_273">The transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) (also termed transient leukemia) observed in infants with Down syndrome represents a clonal expansion of myeloblasts that can be difficult to distinguish from AML. Most importantly, TMD spontaneously regresses in most cases within the first 3 months of life. TMD blasts most commonly have megakaryoblastic differentiation characteristics and distinctive mutations involving the <GeneName>GATA1</GeneName> gene.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/> TMD may occur in phenotypically normal infants with genetic mosaicism in the bone marrow for trisomy 21. While TMD is generally not characterized by cytogenetic abnormalities other than trisomy 21, the presence of additional cytogenetic findings may predict an increased risk for developing subsequent AML.<Reference refidx="8"/> Approximately 20% of infants with Down syndrome and TMD eventually develop AML, with most cases diagnosed within the first 3 years of life.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> Early death from TMD-related complications occurs in 10% to 20% of affected children.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/> Infants with progressive organomegaly, visceral effusions, and laboratory evidence of progressive liver dysfunction are at a particularly high risk for early mortality.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_172">The myelodysplastic syndromes in children represent a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, impaired maturation of myeloid progenitors with dysplastic morphologic features,  and cytopenias.  Although the majority of patients have hypercellular bone marrows without increased numbers of leukemic blasts, some patients may present with very hypocellular bone marrow, making the distinction between severe aplastic anemia and low-blast count AML 
difficult.</Para><Para id="_226">There are genetic risks associated with the development of AML.  There is a high concordance rate of AML in identical twins; however, this is not believed to be related to genetic risk, but rather to shared circulation and the inability of one twin to reject leukemic cells from the other twin during fetal development.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/>  There is an estimated twofold- to fourfold-risk of fraternal twins each developing leukemia up to about age 6 years, after which the risk is not significantly greater than that of the general population.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/>  The development of AML has also been associated with a variety of predisposition syndromes that result from chromosomal imbalances or instabilities, defects in DNA repair, altered cytokine receptor or signal transduction pathway activation, as well as altered protein synthesis.<Reference refidx="15"/> </Para><ItemizedList id="_267" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListTitle>Inherited and Acquired Genetic Syndromes Associated with Myeloid Malignancies</ListTitle><ListItem><Strong>Inherited syndromes</Strong><ItemizedList id="_268" Style="dash"><ListItem>Chromosomal imbalances:<ItemizedList id="_269" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Down syndrome.</ListItem><ListItem>Familial monosomy 7.</ListItem></ItemizedList></ListItem><ListItem>Chromosomal instability syndromes:<ItemizedList id="_270" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Fanconi anemia.</ListItem><ListItem>Dyskeratosis congenita.</ListItem><ListItem>Bloom syndrome.</ListItem></ItemizedList></ListItem><ListItem>Syndromes of growth and cell survival signaling pathway defects:<ItemizedList id="_271" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Neurofibromatosis type 1 (particularly JMML

abnormalities have been identified in the blasts of about 75% of children with
AML and are useful in defining subtypes with particular characteristics (e.g.,
t(8;21), t(15;17), inv(16), 11q23 abnormalities, t(1;22)).
Leukemias with the chromosomal abnormalities t(8;21) and inv(16) are called core-binding factor leukemias; core-binding factor (a transcription factor involved in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation) is disrupted by each of these abnormalities. </Para><Para id="_29">Molecular probes and newer cytogenetic techniques (e.g., fluorescence <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis>
hybridization [FISH]) can detect cryptic abnormalities that were not evident by
standard cytogenetic banding studies.<Reference refidx="31"/>  This is clinically important when
optimal therapy differs, as in APL.  Use of these techniques can identify cases
of APL when the diagnosis is suspected but the t(15;17) is not identified by
routine cytogenetic evaluation.  The presence of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome in
 patients with AML most likely represents chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
that has transformed to AML rather than de novo AML. 
Molecular methods are also being used to identify recurring gene mutations in adults and children with AML, and as described below, some of these recurring mutations have prognostic significance.</Para><Para id="_477">A unifying concept for the role of specific mutations in AML is that mutations that promote proliferation (Type I) and mutations that block normal myeloid development (Type II) are required for full conversion of hematopoietic stem/precursor cells to malignancy.<Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/>  Support for this conceptual construct comes from the observation that there is generally mutual exclusivity within each type of mutation, such that a single Type I and a single Type II mutation are present within each case.  Further support comes from genetically engineered models of AML for which cooperative events rather than single mutations are required for leukemia development.  Type I mutations are commonly in genes involved in growth factor signal transduction and include mutations in <GeneName>FLT3</GeneName>, <GeneName>KIT</GeneName>, <GeneName>NRAS</GeneName>, <GeneName>KRAS</GeneName>, and <GeneName>PTNP11</GeneName>.<Reference refidx="34"/>  Type II genomic alterations include the common translocations and mutations associated with favorable prognosis (t(8;21), inv(16), t(16;16), t(15;17), <GeneName>CEBPA</GeneName>, and <GeneName>NPM1</GeneName>).  <GeneName>MLL</GeneName> rearrangements (translocations and partial tandem duplication) are also classified as Type II mutations.</Para><Para id="_543">Specific recurring cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities are briefly described below.

system for  these myeloid malignancies.  Leukemia is considered to be disseminated in the hematopoietic
system at diagnosis, even in children with AML who
present with isolated chloromas (also called granulocytic sarcomas).  If these
children do not receive systemic chemotherapy, they invariably develop AML in
months or years.  AML may invade nonhematopoietic tissue such as meninges,
brain parenchyma, testes or ovaries, or skin (leukemia cutis).  Extramedullary
leukemia is more common in infants than in older children with AML.<Reference refidx="205"/>   
</Para><SummarySection id="_42"><Title> Newly diagnosed</Title><Para id="_43">Childhood AML is diagnosed when bone marrow has greater than   20%  blasts.  The
blasts have the morphologic and histochemical characteristics of one of the FAB
subtypes of AML.  It can also be diagnosed by biopsy of a chloroma.  For
treatment purposes, patients with clonal cytogenetic abnormalities typically associated with AML, such as t(8:21) (<GeneName>RUNX1-RUNX1T1</GeneName>), inv(16)(<GeneName>CBFB-MYH11</GeneName>), t(9;11)(<GeneName>MLL-MLLT3(AF9)</GeneName>) or t(15;17)(<GeneName>PML-RARA</GeneName>) and who have less than 20% bone marrow blasts, are   considered to have AML rather than myelodysplastic syndrome.<Reference refidx="206"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_44"><Title> In remission</Title><Para id="_45">Remission  is defined in the United States as peripheral blood counts (WBC
count, differential, and platelet count) rising toward normal, a mildly
hypocellular to normal cellular marrow with fewer than 5% blasts, and no
clinical signs or symptoms of the disease, including in the CNS or at other extramedullary sites.  Achieving a hypoplastic bone marrow
is usually the first step in obtaining remission in AML with the
exception of the M3 (acute promyelocytic leukemia [APL]); a hypoplastic marrow
phase is often not necessary before the achievement of remission in APL. 
Additionally, early recovery marrows in any of the subtypes of AML may be
difficult to distinguish from persistent leukemia, although the application of flow cytometric immunophenotyping and cytogenetic/molecular testing have  made this less problematic. Correlation with blood
cell counts and clinical status is
imperative in passing final judgment on the results of early bone marrow
findings in AML.<Reference refidx="207"/> If the findings are in doubt, the bone marrow
aspirate should be repeated in 1 to 2 weeks.<Reference refidx="205"/>

approach is systemically administered combination chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="1"/> Future approaches involving risk-group stratification and biologically targeted therapies are being tested to improve antileukemic treatment while sparing normal tissues.<Reference refidx="2"/> Optimal
treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) requires control of bone marrow and systemic disease. 
Treatment of the central nervous system (CNS), usually with intrathecal medication,
is a component of most pediatric AML protocols but has not yet been shown to
contribute directly to an improvement in survival. CNS  irradiation is not necessary in patients either as prophylaxis or for those presenting with cerebrospinal fluid leukemia that clears with intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy.</Para><Para id="_48">Treatment is ordinarily divided into two phases: (1) induction (to attain
remission), and (2) postremission consolidation/intensification.  Postremission
therapy may consist of varying numbers of courses of intensive chemotherapy
and/or allogeneic  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).  For example,  ongoing trials of the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) and the United Kingdom Medical Research Council (MRC) utilize similar chemotherapy regimens consisting of two courses of induction chemotherapy followed by two additional courses of intensification chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/>
</Para><Para id="_49">Maintenance therapy is not part of most pediatric AML protocols  as two randomized clinical trials failed to show a benefit for maintenance chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/> The exception to this generalization is acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), for which maintenance therapy has been shown to improve event-free survival and overall survival (OS).<Reference refidx="7"/>    </Para><Para id="_484">Treatment approaches currently used for AML are usually associated with severe and protracted myelosuppression  along with other associated complications.  Treatment with hematopoietic growth factors (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF] and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) has been used in an attempt to reduce the toxic effects associated with
severe myelosuppression but does not influence ultimate outcome.<Reference refidx="8"/>  Virtually
all randomized trials of hematopoietic growth factors (GM-CSF and G-CSF) in adults with AML
have demonstrated significant reduction in the time to neutrophil
recovery,<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/> but varying degrees of reduction in morbidity and little, if any,
effect on mortality.<Reference refidx="8"/>
 The BFM 98 study confirmed a lack of benefit for the use of G-CSF  in a randomized pediatric AML trial.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para><Para id="_50">Because of the intensity of therapy utilized to treat AML,
children with this disease should have their care coordinated by specialists in
pediatric oncology and be treated in cancer centers or hospitals
with the necessary supportive care facilities (e.g., to administer  specialized blood products;
to manage infectious complications; to provide pediatric intensive care; and to provide emotional and developmental
support). Approximately one-half of the remission induction failures are due to resistant disease and the other half are due to toxic deaths.  For example, in the MRC 10 and 12 AML trials, there was a 4% resistant disease rate in addition to a 4% induction death rate.<Reference refidx="3"/> With increasing rates of survival for children treated for AML comes
an increased awareness of long-term sequelae of various treatments.  For
children who receive intensive chemotherapy, including anthracyclines,
continued monitoring of cardiac function is critical.  Periodic renal and
auditory examinations are also suggested.  In addition, total-body irradiation
before  HSCT increases the risk of growth failure, gonadal
and thyroid dysfunction, and cataract formation.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para><SummarySection id="_183"><Title>Prognostic Factors in Childhood AML</Title><Para id="_184">Prognostic factors in childhood AML have been identified and can be categorized as follows: </Para><ItemizedList id="_447" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem><Strong>Age:</Strong> Several reports published since 2000 have identified older age as being an adverse prognostic factor.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/> The age effect is not large, but there is consistency in the observation that adolescents have a somewhat poorer outcome than younger children.<Para id="_596">While outcome for infants with ALL remains inferior to that of older children, outcome for infants with AML is similar to that of older children when they are treated with standard AML regimens.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/> Infants have been reported to have a 5-year survival of 60% to 70%, although with increased treatment-associated toxicity.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/> </Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Race/Ethnicity:</Strong> In both the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) CCG-2891 and <ProtocolRef href="CDR0000064883" nct_id="NCT00002798">COG-2961</ProtocolRef> (CCG-2961) studies, Caucasian children had higher OS rates than African American and Hispanic children.<Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="23"/> A trend for lower survival rates for African American children compared with Caucasian children was also observed in children treated on St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital AML clinical trials.<Reference refidx="24"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Down syndrome:</Strong> For children with Down syndrome who develop AML, outcome is generally favorable.<Reference refidx="25"/> The prognosis is particularly good (event-free survival exceeding 80%) in children aged 4 years or younger at diagnosis, the age group that accounts for the vast majority of Down syndrome patients with AML.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Para id="_695">A large study of children with AML and Down syndrome confirmed the prognostic significance of younger age,  and it identified the absence of cytogenetic abnormalities (other than trisomy 21), representing approximately 30% of cases, as an independent predictor of inferior OS and EFS.<Reference refidx="28"/> </Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Body mass index:</Strong> In the <ProtocolRef href="CDR0000064883" nct_id="NCT00002798">COG-2961</ProtocolRef> (CCG-2961) study, obesity (body mass index more than 95th percentile for age) was predictive of inferior survival.<Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="29"/> Inferior survival was attributable to early treatment-related mortality that was primarily due to infectious complications.<Reference refidx="29"/> Obesity has been associated with inferior survival in children with AML, primarily caused by a higher rate of fatal infections during the early phases of treatment.<Reference refidx="30"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>White blood cell  (WBC) count:</Strong> WBC count at diagnosis has been consistently noted to be inversely related to survival.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/> Patients with high presenting leukocyte counts have a higher risk of developing pulmonary and CNS complications and have a higher risk of induction death.<Reference refidx="34"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>FAB subtype:</Strong> Associations between FAB subtype and prognosis have been more variable.

profound bone marrow aplasia (with the exception of the M3 APL subtype) is
usually necessary with currently used combination chemotherapy regimens.  Because induction chemotherapy produces severe

the induction period may be significant.
</Para><Para id="_56">The two most effective drugs used to induce remission in children with AML are cytarabine and an anthracycline.  Commonly used
pediatric induction therapy regimens use cytarabine and an anthracycline in

The CCG-2891 study demonstrated that intensively timed induction therapy (4-day

2 weeks or longer).<Reference refidx="3"/>  The MRC has intensified induction therapy by
prolonging the duration of cytarabine treatment to 10 days.<Reference refidx="9"/>  Another way of
intensifying induction therapy is by the use of high-dose cytarabine.  While
studies in nonelderly adults suggest an advantage for intensifying induction
therapy with high-dose cytarabine (2–3 g/m<Superscript>2</Superscript>/dose) compared with standard-dose

G-CSF or GM-CSF <Reference refidx="23"/> but have not shown significant effects on treatment-related mortality or OS.<Reference refidx="23"/>
A randomized study in children with AML that evaluated G-CSF administered after induction chemotherapy showed a reduction in duration of neutropenia but no difference in infectious complications or mortality.<Reference refidx="24"/> A higher relapse rate has been reported for children with AML expressing the differentiation defective G-CSF receptor isoform IV.<Reference refidx="25"/> 

  Thus, routine prophylactic use of hematopoietic growth factors is not recommended for children with AML.</Para><Para id="_716">The use of antibacterial prophylaxis in children undergoing treatment for AML has been supported by several studies.  A retrospective study from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) in patients with AML reported that the use of intravenous cefepime or vancomycin in conjunction with oral ciprofloxacin or a cephalosporin significantly reduced the incidence of bacterial infection and sepsis compared with patients receiving only oral or no antibiotic prophylaxis.<Reference refidx="26"/>   A retrospective report from the <ProtocolRef href="CDR0000487497" nct_id="NCT00372593">COG-AAML0531 (NCT00372593)</ProtocolRef> trial demonstrated  significant reductions in sterile-site bacterial infection and particularly gram-positive, sterile-site infections were both associated with the use of antibacterial prophylaxis.<Reference refidx="27"/> Of note, this study also reported that prophylactic use of G-CSF reduced bacterial and <ScientificName>Clostridium difficile</ScientificName> infections.<Reference refidx="27"/>  In a study that compared the percentage of bloodstream infections or invasive fungal infections   in children with ALL or AML who underwent chemotherapy and received antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis, a significant reduction in both variables was observed compared with a historical control group that did not receive any prophylaxis.<Reference refidx="28"/>  While such studies suggest a benefit to the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, prospective randomized trials are needed in this pediatric group of patients.</Para><Para id="_717">Similarly, the role of antifungal prophylaxis  has not been studied in children with AML using randomized, prospective studies.  Nevertheless, two meta-analysis reports have suggested that antifungal prophylaxis in pediatric patients with AML during treatment-induced neutropenia or during bone marrow transplantation does reduce the frequency of invasive fungal infections and in some instances nonrelapse mortality.<Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/>  However, another study that analyzed 1,024 patients with AML treated on the <ProtocolRef href="CDR0000487497" nct_id="NCT00372593">COG-AAML0531 (NCT00372593)</ProtocolRef> clinical trial reported no benefit of antifungal prophylaxis on fungal infections or nonrelapse mortality.<Reference refidx="27"/> Several randomized trials in adults with AML, however, have reported significant benefit in reducing invasive fungal infection with the use of antifungal prophylaxis.  Such studies have also balanced cost with adverse side effects; when effectiveness at reducing invasive fungal infection is balanced with these other factors, posaconazole, voriconazole, caspofungin, and micafungin are considered reasonable choices.<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/><Reference refidx="35"/></Para><SummarySection id="_336"><Title>Treatment options under clinical evaluation</Title><Para id="_337">The following are examples of national and/or institutional clinical trials that are currently being conducted.

lymphoblastic leukemia to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is nevertheless typical for
childhood acute leukemia. The exception is during the first 3 years of life,

A key issue in thinking about therapy for pediatric patients with MDS is that these disorders usually involve a primitive hematopoietic stem cell.

Unresolved issues include determining the best transplant preparative regimen and source of donor cells.<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/>  However, some data are important to consider when making decisions.  For example, survival as high as 80% has been reported for patients with early-stage MDS proceeding to transplant within a few months of diagnosis.

The Children's Cancer Group 2891 trial accrued patients between 1989 and 1995, including children with
MDS.<Reference refidx="34"/>  There were 77 patients with refractory anemia (n = 2), refractory anemia with excess blasts (n = 33),
refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (n = 26), or AML with antecedent MDS (n = 16) who were enrolled and randomly assigned
to standard or intensively timed induction. Subsequently, patients were allocated to
allogeneic HSCT if there was a suitable family donor, or
randomly assigned to autologous HSCT or chemotherapy.  Patients with
refractory anemia/refractory anemia with excess blasts had a poor remission rate (45%),  and those with refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (69%) or AML
with history of MDS (81%) had similar remission rates compared with de novo AML (77%).  Six-year survival
was poor for those with refractory anemia/refractory anemia with excess blasts (28%) and refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (30%).  Patients with AML and
antecedent MDS had a similar outcome to those with de novo AML (50% survival compared with
45%).  Allogeneic HSCT appeared to improve survival at a marginal level of significance (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .08). Based on analysis of these data and the literature, the authors concluded that children with a history of MDS who present with AML and many of those with refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation do as well with AML therapy at diagnosis as children with AML.  An exception to this conclusion is children with AML with a precedent MDS and monosomy 7; these patients have a very poor prognosis and are usually treated with some type of allogeneic HSCT.   An analysis of 37 children with MDS treated on Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster AML protocols 83, 87, and 93 confirmed the induction response of 74% for patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation and suggested that transplantation was beneficial.<Reference refidx="43"/> Another study by the same group showed that with current approaches to HSCT, survival occurred in more than 60% of children with advanced MDS, and outcomes for patients receiving unrelated donor cells were similar to those for patients who received matched-family donor (MFD) cells.<Reference refidx="44"/></Para><Para id="_510">A significant issue to consider for these results is that the subtype refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation is likely to represent patients with overt AML, while refractory anemia and refractory anemia with excess blasts represent MDS. The WHO classification has now omitted the category of refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation, concluding that this entity was essentially AML.  The optimal therapy for patients with refractory anemia/refractory anemia with excess blasts without an HLA-MFD is unknown. Some of these patients require no therapy for years and have indolent diseases.  Because failure rates after HSCT are lower in this group, strong consideration should be given for transplantation, especially when a 5/6 or 6/6 HLA-MFD is available.

One study described outcomes of 27 children with t-AML who received related and unrelated donor HSCT.  Three-year OS rates were 18.5% ± 7.5% and event-free survival rates were 18.7% ± 7.5%.  Poor survival was mainly the result of very high transplant-related mortality  (59.6% ± 8.4%).<Reference refidx="13"/>  Another study reported a second retrospective single-center experience of 14 patients transplanted for t-AML/t-MDS between 1975 and 2007.  Survival was 29%, but in this review only 63% of patients diagnosed with t-AML/t-MDS underwent HSCT.<Reference refidx="11"/>  A multicenter study (CCG-2891) looked at outcomes of 24 children with t-AML/t-MDS compared with other children enrolled on the study with de novo AML (n = 898) or MDS (n = 62).  Children with t-AML/t-MDS were older and low-risk cytogenetics rarely occurred.  Although rates of achieving CR and OS at 3 years were worse in the t-AML/t-MDS group (CR, 50% vs. 72%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .016; OS, 26% vs. 47%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .007), survival was similar (OS, 45% vs. 53%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .87) if patients achieved a CR.<Reference refidx="14"/>  The importance of remission to survival in these patients is further illustrated by another single-center report of 21 children undergoing HSCT for t-AML/t-MDS between 1994 and 2009.  Of the 21 children, 12 had t-AML (11 in CR at the time of transplant), seven had refractory anemia (for whom induction was not done), and two had refractory anemia with excess blasts.  Survival of the entire cohort was 61%; those in remission or with refractory anemia had a disease-free survival of 66%, and for the three patients with more than 5% blasts at the time of HSCT, survival was 0% (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .015).<Reference refidx="15"/>

Because t-AML is rare in children, it is not known whether the significant decrease in transplant-related mortality after unrelated donor HSCT noted over the past several years will translate to improved survival in this population.  Patients should be carefully assessed for pre-HSCT morbidities caused by earlier therapies and approaches should be adapted to give adequate intensity while minimizing transplant-related mortality.

Early cardiac toxic effects was a significant predictor of late cardiac toxic effects and the development of clinical cardiomyopathy requiring long-term therapy.<Reference refidx="4"/> Retrospective analysis of a single study suggests cardiac risk may be increased in children with Down syndrome,<Reference refidx="5"/> but prospective studies are required to confirm this finding.</Para><Para id="_723">For children undergoing chemotherapy only for treatment of AML, renal, gastrointestinal, and hepatic late adverse effects have been reported to be rare.<Reference refidx="6"/>  A Nordic Society for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology retrospective trial of children treated for AML with chemotherapy only at a median follow-up of 11 years, based on a self-reported use of health care services, demonstrated similar  health care usage and marital status as their siblings.<Reference refidx="7"/> A COG study using a health-related, quality-of-life comparison reported an overall 21% of 5-year survivors having a severe or life-threatening chronic health condition; when compared by type of treatment, this percentage was 16% for the chemotherapy-only treated group, 21% for the autologous HSCT treated group, and 33% for those who received an allogeneic HSCT.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_203">In a review from one institution, the highest frequency of adverse long-term sequelae for children treated for AML included the following incidence rates: growth abnormalities (51%), neurocognitive abnormalities (30%), transfusion-acquired hepatitis (28%), infertility (25%), endocrinopathies (16%), restrictive lung disease (20%), chronic graft-versus-host disease (20%), secondary malignancies (14%), and cataracts (12%).<Reference refidx="9"/> Most of these adverse sequelae are the consequence of myeloablative, allogeneic HSCT.  Although cardiac abnormalities were reported in 8% of patients, this is an issue that may be particularly relevant with the current use of increased anthracyclines in clinical trials for children with newly diagnosed AML.   Another study examined outcomes for children younger than 3 years  with AML or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent HSCT.<Reference refidx="10"/>  The toxicities reported include growth hormone deficiency (59%), dyslipidemias (59%), hypothyroidism (35%), osteochondromas (24%), and decreased bone mineral density (24%).  Two of the 33 patients developed secondary malignancies.  Survivors had average intelligence but frequent attention-deficit problems and fine-movement abnormalities, compared with population controls.  In contrast, The Bone Marrow Transplant Survivor Study compared childhood AML or ALL survivors with siblings using a self-reporting questionnaire.<Reference refidx="11"/>  The median follow-up was 8.4 years and 86% of patients received total-body irradiation (TBI) as part of their preparative transplant regimen.  Survivors of leukemia who received an HSCT had significantly higher frequencies of several adverse effects, including diabetes, hypothyroidism, osteoporosis, cataracts, osteonecrosis, exercise-induced shortness of breath, neurosensory impairments and problems with balance, tremor, and weakness than siblings.  The overall assessment of health was significantly decreased in survivors compared with siblings (odds ratio  = 2.2; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .03).  Significant differences were not observed between regimens using TBI compared with chemotherapy only, which mostly included busulfan. The outcomes were similar for patients with AML and ALL, suggesting that the primary cause underlying the adverse late effects was undergoing an HSCT.</Para><Para id="_530">A population-based study of survivors of childhood AML who had not undergone an HSCT reported equivalent rates of educational achievement, employment, and marital status compared with siblings.  AML survivors were, however, significantly more likely to be receiving prescription drugs, especially for asthma, compared with siblings (23% vs. 9%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .03).  Chronic fatigue has also been demonstrated to be a significantly more likely adverse late effect in survivors of childhood AML than in survivors of other malignancies.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_531">New therapeutic approaches to reduce long-term adverse sequelae are needed, especially for reducing the late sequelae associated with myeloablative HSCT.</Para><Para id="_532">Important resources for details on follow-up and risks for survivors of cancer have been developed by the Children Oncology Group’s <ExternalRef xref="http://www.survivorshipguidelines.org/pdf/ltfuguidelines.pdf">Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines for Survivors of Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancers</ExternalRef>  and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network <ExternalRef xref="http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp">Guidelines for Acute Myeloid Leukemia</ExternalRef>.
