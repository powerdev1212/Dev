primary precursor lesion of colon cancer.</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_1359">More than  95% of CRCs are
carcinomas, and about 95% of these are adenocarcinomas.  It is well recognized
that adenomatous polyps are benign tumors that may undergo malignant
transformation.  They have been classified into three histologic types, with
increasing malignant potential: tubular, tubulovillous, and villous.  While
there is no direct proof that most CRCs arise from
adenomas, adenocarcinomas are generally considered to arise from
adenomas,<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/> based upon the following important observations:</Para><OrderedList id="_1360" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>Benign and

lesions may be more prevalent than previously recognized.  Large, flat, and
depressed lesions may be more likely to be severely dysplastic, although this remains to be clearly proven.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/> Specialized
techniques may be needed to identify, biopsy, and remove such lesions.<Reference refidx="17"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_6"><Title>Molecular Events Associated With Colon Carcinogenesis</Title><Para id="_7">The transition from normal epithelium to adenoma to carcinoma is associated
with acquired molecular events.<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/>  This tumor progression model was
deduced from comparison of genetic alterations seen in normal colon epithelium,
adenomas of progressively larger size, and malignancies.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/>  At least five to
seven major deleterious molecular alterations may occur when a normal epithelial cell
progresses in a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460134">clonal</GlossaryTermRef> fashion to carcinoma.  There are at least two major
pathways by which these molecular events can lead to CRC.  While the majority of CRCs are due to events that result in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046470">chromosomal</GlossaryTermRef>
instability (CIN), 20% to 30% of CRCs display characteristic patterns of gene hypermethylation, termed CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), of which a portion display <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000285933">microsatellite instability</GlossaryTermRef> (15% of CRCs).<Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/>  </Para><Para id="_702">The spectrum of somatic mutations contributing to the pathogenesis of CRC is likely to be far more extensive than previously appreciated. A comprehensive study that sequenced more than 13,000 genes in a series of CRCs found that tumors accumulate an average of approximately 90 mutant genes. Sixty-nine genes were highlighted as relevant to the pathogenesis of CRC, and individual CRCs harbored an average of nine mutant genes per tumor. In addition, each tumor studied had a distinct mutational gene signature.<Reference refidx="28"/></Para><Para id="_8">Key changes in CIN cancers include
widespread alterations in chromosome number (aneuploidy) and frequent detectable losses
at the molecular level of portions of chromosome 5q, chromosome 18q, and
chromosome 17p; and mutation of the <GeneName>KRAS</GeneName> oncogene. The important genes involved in these chromosome losses are <GeneName>APC</GeneName> (5q),
<GeneName>DCC/MADH2/MADH4</GeneName> (18q), and <GeneName>TP53</GeneName> (17p),<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="29"/> and chromosome losses are
associated with instability at the molecular and chromosomal level.<Reference refidx="20"/>  Among
the earliest events in the colorectal tumor progression pathway is loss of the
<GeneName>APC</GeneName> gene, which appears to be consistent with its important role in
predisposing persons with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460154">germline</GlossaryTermRef> <GeneName>APC</GeneName> mutations to colorectal tumors.  Acquired or
inherited mutations of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045671">DNA</GlossaryTermRef> damage-repair genes also play a role in predisposing
colorectal epithelial cells to mutations.  Furthermore, the specific genes that undergo somatic mutations and the specific type of mutations the tumor acquires may influence the rate of tumor growth or type of pathologic change in the tumors.<Reference refidx="29"/> For example, the rate of adenoma-to-carcinoma progression appears to be faster in microsatellite-unstable tumors compared with microsatellite-stable tumors. Characteristic histologic changes such as increased mucin production can be seen in tumors that demonstrate microsatellite instability (MSI), suggesting that at least some molecular events contribute to the histologic features of the tumors. 
</Para><Para id="_9">The key characteristics of MSI cancers are that they are tumors with a largely intact
chromosome complement and that, as a result of defects in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system, they more readily acquire mutations in important cancer-associated genes compared with cells that have an effective DNA MMR system.  These types of cancers are detectable at the molecular level by
alterations in repeating units of DNA that occur normally throughout the
genome, known as DNA microsatellites.  </Para><Para id="_11">The knowledge derived from the study of inherited CRC <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339343">syndromes</GlossaryTermRef> has provided important clues regarding the molecular events that mediate tumor initiation and tumor progression in people
without germline abnormalities.  Among the earliest events in the colorectal
tumor progression pathway (both MSI and CIN) is loss of function of the <GeneName>APC</GeneName>
gene product, which appears to be consistent with its important role in predisposing
persons with germline <GeneName>APC</GeneName> mutations to colorectal tumors.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_12"><Title>Family History as a Risk Factor for CRC</Title><Para id="_13">Some of the earliest studies of family history of CRC were those of 
Utah families that reported a higher number of deaths from CRC
(3.9%) among the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460150">first-degree relatives</GlossaryTermRef> of patients who had died from
CRC than among sex-matched and age-matched controls (1.2%).<Reference refidx="30"/>  This
difference has since been replicated in numerous studies that have consistently
found that first-degree relatives of affected cases are themselves at a twofold to
threefold increased risk of CRC.  Despite the various study
designs (case-control, cohort), sampling frames, sample sizes, methods of data
verification, analytic methods, and countries where the studies originated, the
magnitude of risk is consistent.<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/><Reference refidx="35"/><Reference refidx="36"/>
</Para><Para id="_14">Population-based studies have shown a familial association for close relatives of colon cancer patients to develop CRC and other cancers.<Reference refidx="37"/> Using data from a cancer family clinic patient population, the relative and absolute risk
of CRC for different family history categories was estimated (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_326" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Table 1</SummaryRef>).<Reference refidx="38"/><Reference refidx="39"/> 
</Para><Para id="_786">A systematic review and meta-analysis of familial CRC risk was reported.<Reference refidx="39"/> Of 24 studies included in the analysis, all but one reported an increased risk of CRC if there was an affected first-degree relative. The relative risk (RR) for CRC in the pooled study was 2.25 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.00–2.53) if there was an affected first-degree family member.  In 8 of 11 studies, if the index cancer arose in the colon, the risk was slightly higher than if it arose in the rectum. The pooled analysis revealed a  RR in relatives of colon and rectal cancer patients of 2.42 (95% CI, 2.20–2.65) and 1.89 (95% CI, 1.62–2.21), respectively. The analysis did not reveal a difference in RR for colon cancer based on location of the tumor (right side vs. left side).</Para><Para id="_787">The number of affected family members and age at cancer diagnosis correlated with the CRC risk. In studies reporting more than one first-degree relative with CRC, the RR was 3.76 (95% CI, 2.56–5.51).  The highest RR was observed when the index case was diagnosed  in individuals younger than 45 years,   for family members of index cases diagnosed at ages 45 to 59 years, and for family members of index cases diagnosed at age 60  years or older, respectively (RR, 3.87; 95% CI, 2.40–6.22 vs. RR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.85–2.72 vs. RR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.47–2.25). In this meta-analysis, the familial risk of CRC associated with adenoma in a first-degree relative was analyzed. The pooled analysis demonstrated an RR for CRC of 1.99 (95% CI, 1.55–2.55) in individuals who had a first-degree relative with an adenoma.<Reference refidx="39"/> This finding has been corroborated.<Reference refidx="40"/> Other studies have reported that age at diagnosis of the adenoma influences the CRC risk, with younger age at adenoma diagnosis associated with higher RR.<Reference refidx="41"/><Reference refidx="42"/>  As with any meta-analysis, there could be potential biases that might affect the results of the analysis, including incomplete and nonrandom ascertainment of studies included; publication bias; and heterogeneity between studies relative to design, target populations, and control selection. This study is reinforcement that there are significant associations between familial CRC risk, age at diagnosis of both CRC and adenomas, and multiplicity of affected family members.</Para><Table id="_326"><Title>Table 1.

the possibility of a genetic syndrome is increased substantially.  The first
step in this evaluation is a detailed review of the family history to
determine the number of relatives affected, their relationship to each other,
the age at which the CRC was diagnosed, the presence of multiple
primary CRCs, and the presence of any other cancers (e.g., endometrial) consistent
with an inherited CRC syndrome.  (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_89" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Major

Young subjects who report a positive family history of CRC are more likely to represent a high-risk <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044868">pedigree</GlossaryTermRef> than older individuals who report a positive family history.<Reference refidx="43"/> Computer models are now available to estimate the probability of developing CRC.  These models can be helpful in providing <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044961">genetic counseling</GlossaryTermRef> to individuals at average risk and high risk of developing cancer.

these are described in detail in the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_72" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Colon Cancer Genes</SummaryRef> section of this
summary.  Almost all gene mutations known to cause a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460153">predisposition</GlossaryTermRef> to CRC are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.<Reference refidx="48"/>  To date, at least one example of autosomal recessive inheritance, <GeneName>MYH</GeneName>-associated polyposis (MAP), has been identified. (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_433" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">MYH-Associated Polyposis [MAP]</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information.)  Thus, the family
characteristics that suggest autosomal dominant inheritance of cancer
predisposition are important indicators of high risk and of the possible
presence of a cancer-predisposing mutation.  These include the following: 
</Para><OrderedList id="_313" Style="Arabic" Compact="No"><ListItem>Vertical transmission of cancer predisposition in autosomal dominant conditions.  (Vertical transmission
refers to the presence of a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460153">genetic predisposition</GlossaryTermRef> in sequential generations.)
</ListItem><ListItem>Inheritance risk of 50% for both males and females.  When a parent carries
an autosomal dominant genetic predisposition, each child has a 50% chance of
inheriting the predisposition.  The risk is the same for both male and female
children.
</ListItem><ListItem>Other clinical characteristics also suggest inherited risk:<ItemizedList id="_23" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Cancers in people with a hereditary predisposition typically
occur at an earlier age than in sporadic (nongenetic) cases.
</ListItem>
<ListItem>A predisposition to CRC may include a
predisposition to other cancers, such as endometrial cancer, as detailed
in the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_89" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Major Genetic Syndromes</SummaryRef> section of this summary.

<ListItem>In addition, two or more primary cancers may occur in a single individual. 
These could be multiple primary cancers of the same type (e.g., two
separate primary CRCs) or primary cancer of different types
(e.g., colorectal and endometrial cancer in the same individual).
</ListItem>
<ListItem>The presence of non-neoplastic extracolonic features may suggest a hereditary colon cancer predisposition syndrome (e.g., congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and desmoids in familial adenomatous polyposis [FAP]).</ListItem><ListItem>An uncommon tumor (e.g., adrenocortical, sebaceous carcinoma, ampullary, and small bowel) may serve as a clue to the presence of a hereditary cancer syndrome, such as Li-Fraumeni or FAP.</ListItem><ListItem>The presence of multiple polyps may suggest a hereditary colon cancer predisposition syndrome. As susceptibility to oligopolyposis (as few as 10–15 polyps) has become apparent, clinicians, and GI endoscopists in particular, increasingly consider the possibility of inherited conditions, such as AFAP, <GeneName>MYH</GeneName>-associated polyposis, and <GeneName>POLD1</GeneName>/<GeneName>POLE</GeneName>, even when the family history appears entirely negative.  Because oligopolyposis also involves diverse pathology (including hamartomas, sessile serrated polyps, and sessile serrated adenomas), careful attention to polyp count and polyp histologies helps to determine whether genetic testing and/or further clinical evaluation is appropriate.</ListItem></ItemizedList></ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_24">Hereditary CRC has two well-described forms: FAP (including an attenuated form of polyposis [AFAP]), due to

used to prevent the development of cancer or cancer-related morbidity and
mortality once it has developed.  While one can also use the information for
family planning, decisions about work and retirement, and other important life
decisions, prevention is usually the central concern.
</Para><Para id="_34">This section covers screening: testing in the absence of symptoms for
CRC and its precursors (i.e., adenomatous polyps) to identify
people with an increased probability of developing CRC.  Those
with abnormalities should undergo diagnostic testing to see whether they have an
occult cancer, followed by treatment if cancer or a precursor is found.  Taken
together, this set of activities is aimed at either preventing the development
of CRC by finding and removing its precursor, the adenomatous
polyp, or increasing the likelihood of cure by early detection and treatment. 
</Para><Para id="_1308">In the context of high-risk syndromes such as LS or FAP, surveillance implies examining patients in whom adenoma or cancer occurrence is highly probable, and the examination is done for early detection. It is not screening in the traditional sense. The meaning of the terms screening versus surveillance has evolved over time and their  usage in this summary may not be consistent with  other oncologic and epidemiologic contexts.</Para><Para id="_35">Primary prevention (eliminating the causes of CRC in people with
genetically increased risk) is addressed later in this section.
</Para><SummarySection id="_233"><Title>State of the evidence base</Title><Para id="_37">Currently, there are no published randomized controlled trials of surveillance in
people with a genetically increased risk of CRC and few controlled
comparisons.  While a randomized trial with a no-surveillance arm is not feasible,
there is a need for well-designed studies comparing various surveillance methods
or differing periods of time between procedures.  An observational study that compared surveilled subjects with unsurveilled (by choice)
controls evaluated a 15-year experience with 252 relatives at risk of
LS, 119 of whom declined surveillance. 
Eight of 133 (6%) in the surveilled group developed CRC, compared
with 19 in the unsurveilled group (16%, <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .014).<Reference refidx="63"/>  In general, however, people
with genetic risk have been excluded from the trials of CRC
screening that have been published thus far, so it is not possible to estimate
effectiveness by subgroup analyses.  Therefore, prevention in these patients
cannot be based on strong evidence of effectiveness, as is ordinarily relied
on by expert groups when suggesting screening or surveillance guidelines.
</Para><Para id="_38">Given these considerations, clinical decisions are based on clinical
judgment.  These decisions take into account the biologic and clinical behavior
of each kind of genetic condition, and possible parallels with patients
at average risk, for whom screening is known to be effective.  </Para><Para id="_39">The evidence base for the effectiveness of screening in average-risk people

approach to people at increased risk. (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062753" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-screening-pdq">Screening
for Colorectal Cancer</SummaryRef> for more information.)  </Para><Para id="_41">The fact that screening of average-risk persons reduces the risk of dying from
CRC forms the basis for recommending surveillance in persons at a higher genetic risk of CRC.  As logical as this approach
seems, randomized trials of surveillance have
not been performed in this special population, though observational studies performed on families with LS <Reference refidx="64"/><Reference refidx="65"/> and FAP
<Reference refidx="66"/> support the value of surveillance.  These studies demonstrate a shift
towards earlier stage at diagnosis and a corresponding reduction in CRC mortality
among colonoscopy-detected cancers.

also known.  Evidence that early intervention results in better outcomes
(criterion 3) is limited but suggests benefit.  One study in the setting of

</Para><Para id="_55">At this time, the use of mutation testing to identify <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000256553">genetic susceptibility</GlossaryTermRef> to
CRC is not recommended as a screening measure in the general

general population testing potentially misleading and not cost effective.

groups to recommend these drugs and supplements specifically to prevent
CRC, and few studies specifically enrolled people with an
inherited predisposition for CRC.  Although antioxidants are

</Para><Para id="_75">The functions of the major colon cancer genes have been reasonably well characterized over the past decade.  Three proposed classes of colon cancer genes are tumor suppressor genes, oncogenes, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045671">DNA</GlossaryTermRef> repair genes.<Reference refidx="2"/> Tumor suppressor genes constitute the most important class of genes responsible for hereditary cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339343">syndromes</GlossaryTermRef> and represent the class of genes responsible for both <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460148">familial</GlossaryTermRef> adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS), among others. <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460154">Germline</GlossaryTermRef> mutations of oncogenes are not an important cause of inherited susceptibility to colorectal cancer (CRC), even though somatic mutations in oncogenes are ubiquitous in virtually all forms of gastrointestinal cancers. Stability genes, especially the mismatch repair (MMR) genes responsible for Lynch syndrome (LS) (also called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer [HNPCC]), account for a substantial fraction of hereditary CRC, as noted below. (Refer to the  <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_120" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Lynch syndrome [LS]</SummaryRef> section in the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_89" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Major Genetic Syndromes</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information).  <GeneName>MYH</GeneName> is another important example of a stability gene that confers risk of CRC based on defective base excision repair. Table 2 summarizes the genes that confer a substantial risk of CRC, with their corresponding diseases.

Now that some of the genes involved in these syndromes have been identified, a few studies have attempted to estimate the spontaneous mutation rate (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460142">de novo mutation</GlossaryTermRef> rate) in these populations. Interestingly, FAP, JPS, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Cowden syndrome, and Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome are all thought to have high rates of spontaneous mutations, in the 25% to 30% range,<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/> while estimates of de novo mutations in the MMR genes associated with LS are thought to be low, in the 0.9% to 5% range.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> These estimates of spontaneous mutation rates in LS seem to overlap with the estimates of nonpaternity rates in various populations (0.6% to 3.3%),<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/> making the de novo mutation rate for LS seem quite low in contrast to the relatively high rates in the other polyposis syndromes.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_2574"><Title>Genetic Polymorphisms and CRC Risk</Title><Para id="_2575">It is widely acknowledged that the familial clustering of colon cancer also occurs outside of the setting of well-characterized colon cancer family syndromes.<Reference refidx="12"/>  Based on epidemiological studies, the risk of colon cancer in a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460150">first-degree relative</GlossaryTermRef> of an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460124">affected</GlossaryTermRef> individual can increase an individual’s lifetime risk of colon cancer 2-fold to 4.3-fold.<Reference refidx="13"/> The relative risk (RR) and absolute risk
of CRC for different family history categories is estimated in <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_326" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Table 1</SummaryRef>.  In addition, the lifetime risk of colon cancer also increases in first-degree relatives of individuals with colon adenomas.<Reference refidx="14"/>  The magnitude of risk depends on the age at diagnosis of the index case, the degree of relatedness of the index case to the at-risk case, and the number of affected relatives.  It is currently believed that many of the moderate- and low-risk cases are influenced by low-penetrance genes or gene combinations.  Given the public health impact of identifying the etiology of this increased risk, an intense search for the responsible genes is under way.</Para><Para id="_2576">Each <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460162">locus</GlossaryTermRef> would be expected to have a relatively small effect on CRC risk and would not produce the dramatic familial aggregation seen in LS or FAP. However, in combination with other common genetic loci and/or environmental factors, variants of this kind might significantly alter CRC risk. These types of genetic variations are often referred to as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044805">polymorphisms</GlossaryTermRef>. Most loci that are polymorphic have no influence on disease risk or human traits (benign polymorphisms), while those that are associated with a difference in risk of disease or a human trait (however subtle) are sometimes termed disease-associated polymorphisms or functionally relevant polymorphisms.  When such variation involves changes in single nucleotides of DNA they are referred to as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000458046">single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para><Para id="_2577">Polymorphisms underlying polygenic susceptibility to CRC are considered low penetrance, a term often applied to sequence variants associated with a minimal to moderate risk. This is in contrast to high-penetrance variants or alleles that are typically associated with more severe phenotypes, for example those <GeneName>APC</GeneName> or MMR gene  mutations leading to an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339338">autosomal dominant</GlossaryTermRef> inheritance pattern in a family. The definition of a moderate risk of cancer is arbitrary, but it is usually considered to be in the range of an RR of 1.5 to 2.0. Because these types of sequence variants are relatively common in the population, their contribution to total cancer risk is estimated to be much higher than the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000485393">attributable risk</GlossaryTermRef> in the population from the relatively rare   syndromes such as FAP or LS.   Additionally, polymorphisms in genes distinct from the MMR genes can modify phenotype (e.g., average age of CRC) in individuals with LS.</Para><Para id="_2578">In general, low-penetrance variants have been identified in one of two manners.  Earlier studies focused on candidates genes chosen because of biologic relevance to colon cancer pathogenesis.

It is estimated that heredity is responsible for approximately one-third of the susceptibility to CRC,<Reference refidx="18"/> and causative germline mutations account for less than 6% of all CRC cases.<Reference refidx="19"/> This has led to suspicions that there may be other major genes that, when mutated, predispose to CRC with or without polyposis.  A few such genes have been detected (e.g., <GeneName>MYH</GeneName>, <GeneName>EPCAM</GeneName>) but the probability for discovery of other such genes is fairly low.  More recent measures for new gene discovery have taken a genome-wide approach.  Several GWAS have been conducted with relatively large, unselected series of CRC patients that have been evaluated for patterns of polymorphisms in candidate and anonymous genes spread throughout the genome.  These SNPs are chosen to capture a large portion of common variation within the genome, based on the International HapMap Project.<Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/> The goal is to identify alleles that, while not pathologically mutated, may confer an increase (or potential decrease) in CRC risk. Identification of yet unknown aberrant CRC alleles would permit further stratification of at-risk individuals on a genetic basis. Such risk stratification would potentially enhance  CRC screening. The use of genome-wide scans has led to the discovery of multiple common low-risk CRC susceptibility alleles.

Gardner syndrome (colorectal polyposis, osteomas, and soft tissue tumors).  Gardner syndrome has sometimes been used to designate FAP
patients who manifest these extracolonic features.
However, Gardner syndrome has been shown molecularly to be a variant of FAP, and thus the term Gardner syndrome is essentially obsolete in clinical practice.<Reference refidx="19"/></Para><Para id="_94">Most cases of FAP result from mutations of the <GeneName>APC</GeneName> gene on chromosome 5q21.

The age at onset of adenomas in the colon is variable: By age 10 years, only 15% of

proponents feel that the genetic testing of children for FAP presents an
example in which possible medical benefit justifies genetic testing of minors,

Duodenotomy and local resection of duodenal polyps or mucosectomy have been reported, but invariably, the polyps recur after these procedures.<Reference refidx="94"/> In a series of 47 patients with FAP and Spigelman stage III or stage IV disease who underwent definitive radical surgery, the local recurrence rate was reported to be 9% at a mean follow-up of 44 months. This local recurrence rate is dramatically lower than  any local endoscopic or surgical approach from the same study.<Reference refidx="90"/> Pancreaticoduodenectomy and pancreas-sparing duodenectomy are appropriate surgical therapies that are believed to substantially reduce the risk of developing periampullary adenocarcinoma.<Reference refidx="91"/><Reference refidx="94"/><Reference refidx="95"/><Reference refidx="96"/> If such surgical options are considered, preservation of the pylorus is of particular benefit in this group of patients because most will have undergone a subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis or total colectomy with ileal pouch–anal anastomosis (IPAA). As noted in a Northern European study,<Reference refidx="16"/> and others,<Reference refidx="97"/><Reference refidx="98"/>  the vast majority of patients with duodenal adenomas will not develop cancer and can be followed with endoscopy. However, individuals with advanced adenomas (Spigelman stage III or stage IV disease) generally require endoscopic or surgical treatment of the polyps. Chemoprevention studies for duodenal adenomas in FAP patients are currently under way and may offer an alternate strategy in the future.</Para><Para id="_1240">The endoscopic approach to larger and/or flatter adenomas of the duodenum depends on whether the ampulla is involved.  Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) after submucosal injection of saline, with or without epinephrine and/or dye, such as indigo carmine, can be employed for nonampullary lesions.  Ampullary lesions require even greater care including endoscopic ultrasound evaluation for evidence of bile or pancreatic duct involvement.  Stenting of the pancreatic duct is commonly performed to prevent stricturing and pancreatitis.  The stents require endoscopic removal at an interval of 1 to 4 weeks.  Because the ampulla is tethered at the ductal orifices, it typically does not uniformly “lift” with injection, so injection is commonly not used.  Any consideration of EMR or ampullectomy requires great experience and judgment, with careful consideration of the natural history of untreated lesions and an appreciation of the high rate of adenoma recurrence despite aggressive endoscopic intervention.<Reference refidx="86"/><Reference refidx="90"/><Reference refidx="91"/><Reference refidx="95"/><Reference refidx="99"/><Reference refidx="100"/><Reference refidx="101"/><Reference refidx="102"/> The literature uniformly supports duodenectomy for Spigelman stage  IV disease. For Spigelman stage II and III disease, there is a role for endoscopic treatment invariably focusing on the one or two worst lesions that are present.</Para><Para id="_1241">Reluctance to consider surgical resection has to do with short-term morbidity and mortality and long-term complications related to surgery.

In some circumstances, endoscopic resection of ampullary and/or other duodenal adenomas cannot be accomplished completely or safely by endoscopic means, and duodenectomy cannot be accomplished without risking a short-gut syndrome or cannot be done at all because of mesenteric fibrosis.  In such cases, surgical transduodenal ampullectomy/polypectomy can be performed.  This is, however, associated with a high risk of local recurrence similar to that of endoscopic treatment.</Para><Para id="_790"><LOERef href="CDR0000531844">Level of evidence: 3diii</LOERef></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_618"><Title>Other tumors</Title><Para id="_712">The spectrum of tumors arising in FAP is summarized in <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_723" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Table 5</SummaryRef>.</Para><Para id="_620">Papillary thyroid cancer has been reported to affect 1% to 2% of patients with FAP.<Reference refidx="110"/> However, a recent study <Reference refidx="111"/> of papillary thyroid cancers in six females with FAP failed to demonstrate <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000486444">loss of heterozygosity </GlossaryTermRef>(LOH) or mutations of the wild-type <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339337">allele</GlossaryTermRef> in codons 545 and 1061 to 1678 of the six tumors.

Once an FAP family member is found to manifest polyps, the only effective management to prevent CRC is eventual colectomy. In patients with classic FAP identified very early in their course, the surgeon, endoscopist, and family may choose to delay surgery for several years in the interest of achieving social milestones. In addition, in carefully selected patients with AFAP (those with minimal polyp burden and advanced age), deferring a decision about colectomy may be reasonable with surgery performed only in the face of advancing polyp burden or dysplasia. </Para><Para id="_1143">The recommended age at which surveillance for polyposis should begin involves a trade-off. On the one hand, someone who waits until the late teens to begin surveillance faces a remote possibility that a cancer will have developed at an earlier age. Although it is rare, CRC can develop in a teenager who carries an <GeneName>APC</GeneName> mutation. On the other hand, it is preferable to allow people at risk to develop emotionally before they are faced with a major surgical decision regarding the timing of colectomy. Therefore, surveillance is usually begun in the early teenage years (age 10–15 years). Surveillance has consisted of either flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy every year.<Reference refidx="92"/><Reference refidx="138"/><Reference refidx="139"/>   If flexible sigmoidoscopy is utilized and polyps are found, colonoscopy should be performed.   Historically, sigmoidoscopy may have been a reasonable approach at the time in identifying early adenomas in a majority of the patients. However, colonoscopy must be considered the tool of choice in light of (a) improved instrumentation for full colonoscopy, (b) safer and deeper sedation (Propofol), (c) recognition of AFAP, in which the disease is typically most manifest in the right colon, and (d) the growing tendency to defer surgery for a number of years.  Individuals who have tested negative for an otherwise known family mutation do not need FAP-oriented surveillance at all. They are recommended to undergo average-risk population screening. In the case of families in which no family mutation has been identified in an affected person, then clinical surveillance is warranted.  Colon surveillance should not be stopped in persons who are known to carry an <GeneName>APC</GeneName> mutation but who do not yet manifest polyps, since adenomas occasionally are not manifest until the fourth and fifth decades of life.

     </Table><Para id="_263">Once an FAP family member is found to manifest polyposis, colectomy is the only effective
management.  Patient and doctor should enter into an
individualized discussion to decide when surgery should be performed.  It is useful
to incorporate into the discussion the risk of developing desmoid tumors
after surgery.  Timing of risk-reducing surgery usually depends on the
number of polyps, their size, histology, and symptomatology.<Reference refidx="144"/>  Once numerous polyps have developed,
surveillance colonoscopy is no longer useful in timing the colectomy because polyps
are so numerous that it is not possible to biopsy or remove all of them. 
At this time, it is appropriate for patients to consult with a surgeon who is experienced with available options, including total colectomy and postcolectomy reconstruction techniques.<Reference refidx="145"/> Rectum-sparing surgery, with sigmoidoscopic surveillance of the remaining
rectum, is a reasonable alternative to total colectomy in those compliant individuals who understand
the consequences and make an informed decision to accept the residual risk of rectal cancer occurring despite periodic surveillance.<Reference refidx="146"/></Para><Para id="_264">Surgical options include restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA, subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA), or total proctocolectomy with ileostomy (TPC). TPC is reserved for patients with low rectal cancer in which the sphincter cannot be spared or for patients on whom an IPAA cannot be performed because of  technical problems.  There is no risk of developing rectal cancer after TPC because the whole mucosa at risk is removed. Whether a colectomy and an IRA or a restorative proctocolectomy is performed, most experts suggest that periodic and lifelong surveillance of
the rectum or the ileal pouch be performed to remove or ablate any polyps.  This is necessitated
by case series of rectal cancers arising in the rectum of FAP patients who had
subtotal colectomies with an IRA in which there was an approximately 25% cumulative risk of rectal adenocarcinoma 20 years after IRA and by case reports of adenocarcinoma in the ileoanal pouch and anal canal after restorative proctocolectomy.<Reference refidx="147"/><Reference refidx="148"/><Reference refidx="149"/><Reference refidx="150"/>   The cumulative risk of rectal cancer after IRA may be lower than that reported in the literature, in part because of better selection of patients for this procedure, such as those with minimal polyp burden in the rectum.<Reference refidx="145"/>   Other factors that have been reported to increase the rectal cancer risk after IRA include the presence of colon cancer at the time of IRA, the length of the rectal stump, and the duration of follow-up after IRA.<Reference refidx="151"/><Reference refidx="152"/> <Reference refidx="153"/><Reference refidx="154"/><Reference refidx="155"/> <Reference refidx="156"/><Reference refidx="157"/> An abdominal colectomy with IRA as the primary surgery for FAP does not preclude later conversion to an IPAA for uncontrolled rectal polyps and/or rectal cancer.

Patients with a mild phenotype (&lt;1,000 colonic adenomas) and fewer than 20 rectal polyps may be candidates for IRA at the time of prophylactic surgery.<Reference refidx="159"/> In some cases, however, the polyp burden is equivocal, and in such cases, investigators have considered the role of genotype in predicting subsequent outcomes with respect to the rectum.<Reference refidx="160"/> Mutations reported to increase the rectal cancer risk and eventual completion proctectomy after IRA include mutations in exon 15 codon 1250, exon 15 codons 1309 and 1328, and exon 15 mutations between codons 1250 and 1464.<Reference refidx="156"/> <Reference refidx="147"/><Reference refidx="157"/><Reference refidx="161"/> In patients who have undergone IPAA, it is important to continue annual surveillance of the ileal pouch because the cumulative risk of developing adenomas in the pouch has been reported to be up to 75% at 15 years.<Reference refidx="162"/><Reference refidx="163"/>  Although they are rare, carcinomas have been reported in the ileal pouch and anal transition zone after restorative proctocolectomy in FAP patients.<Reference refidx="164"/> A meta-analysis of quality of life after restorative proctocolectomy and IPAA has suggested that FAP patients do marginally better than inflammatory bowel disease patients in terms of fistula formation, pouchitis, stool frequency, and seepage.<Reference refidx="165"/></Para><Para id="_265">Celecoxib, a specific cyclooxygenase II (COX-2)

Thus, <Emphasis>oligo-</Emphasis>, Greek for few, can mean different things to different observers.  While conceding a lack of consensus on the matter, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) committee on CRC screening suggests an AFAP diagnosis is worth considering when 10 to 100 adenomas are present.<Reference refidx="92"/>  It will be used here to describe the circumstance in which the polyp count (generally adenoma) is large enough, with or without any attendant family history, to raise in the mind of the endoscopist the possibility of an inherited susceptibility.</Para><Para id="_2644">In the setting of known or suspected LS, the detection of one to ten adenomas is still in keeping with the diagnosis.  A similar adenoma count in a young patient undergoing colonoscopy for symptoms or in a screening patient over age 50 years could raise the question of LS.  In the appropriate clinical setting—early onset and positive family history—the       detection of any number of adenomas may support the testing and diagnosis  of a patient for underlying LS mutations, consistent with guidelines such as those offered by the NCCN.  Some controversy exists over the utility of testing adenoma tissue for microsatellite instability (MSI), as the yield is lower than in invasive cancer.<Reference refidx="216"/>  In general, and subject to the above caveats, LS is not routinely considered in a discussion of oligopolyposis.</Para><Para id="_2645">One study considered a series of polyps (37 adenomas)  from 21 patients with known MMR mutations, performing MSI and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MMR protein expression.<Reference refidx="217"/>   Overall, MSI-high (MSI-H) was seen in 41% and in 100% of adenomas larger than 1 cm.  Adenomas measuring  smaller than 1 cm yielded MSI about 30% of the time.  Correlation between MSI and loss of staining on IHC was fairly high, although the discordance rate (17%) was higher than in other series that evaluated invasive cancers from known MMR mutation carriers.  A higher MSI likelihood was observed in subjects older than 50 years.  IHC staining in relation to mutation showed 8 of 12 <GeneName>MLH1</GeneName> adenomas to have lost protein expression, with 10 of 20 adenomas from <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName> patients to have loss of expression.  In contrast, none (0 of 6) of the adenomas from <GeneName>MSH6</GeneName> mutation carriers had loss of  associated protein expression.  The authors concluded that while normal MSI/IHC was simply not informative, abnormal MSI/IHC was as likely in larger (&gt;8 mm) polyps as in cancers and thus a reasonable test to consider.</Para><Para id="_2646">AFAP is found at the other end of the oligopolyposis spectrum.  Most cases will have  more than 100 adenomas, albeit at a later age and often with a predominance of microadenomas of the right colon and with fewer, larger polyps in the left colon.  Cases with a positive family history and an <GeneName>APC</GeneName> mutation are clearly variant cases of FAP, as the term AFAP implies.<Reference refidx="218"/>  However, patients with no immediate family history and a lesser adenoma burden may not be found to have an <GeneName>APC</GeneName> mutation.  The lower the polyp count the lower the probability of <GeneName>APC</GeneName> mutation.  Some of these cases are now known to carry biallelic <GeneName>MYH</GeneName> mutations, although even here, the lower the adenoma count the lower the mutation likelihood.<Reference refidx="219"/></Para><Para id="_2647">Another study evaluated 152 patients with 3 to 100 adenomas and another 107 <GeneName>APC</GeneName> mutation–negative patients with a “classic” FAP polyp burden for evidence of <GeneName>MYH</GeneName> mutations.<Reference refidx="135"/>  Six patients with multiple adenomas and eight with a classic FAP burden had biallelic <GeneName>MYH</GeneName> mutations.

Similar mutation rates for <GeneName>MYH</GeneName> biallelic mutations were found by others using 20 adenomas as the threshold for considering testing.<Reference refidx="219"/></Para><Para id="_2648">Mutations in related DNA polymerase genes <GeneName>POLE</GeneName> and <GeneName>POLD1</GeneName> have been described in families with oligopolyposis and endometrial cancer.<Reference refidx="220"/><Reference refidx="221"/>  An elegant approach was employed using  whole-genome sequencing in 15 selected patients with more than ten adenomas before age 60 years.  Several had a close relative with at least five adenomas who could also have whole-genome sequencing performed.  All tested patients had CRC or a first-degree relative with CRC.  All had negative <GeneName>APC</GeneName>, <GeneName>MYH</GeneName>, and MMR gene mutation test results.  No variants were found to be in common among the evaluated families.  In one family, however, linkage had established shared regions, in which one shared variant was found (<GeneName>POLE</GeneName> p.Leu424Val; c.1270C&gt;G), with a predicted major derangement in protein structure and function.  In a validation phase, nearly 4,000 affected cases enriched for the presence of multiple adenomas were tested for this variant and compared with nearly 7,000  controls.  In this exercise, 12 additional unrelated cases were found to have the L424V variant, with none of the controls having the variant.  In the affected families, inheritance of multiple-adenoma risk appeared to be autosomal dominant.  Somatic mutations in tumors were generally consistent with the otherwise typical chromosome instability (CIN) pathway, as opposed to MSI or CIMP.  No extracolonic manifestations were seen.  A similar approach, whole-genome testing for shared variants, with further “filtering” by linkage analysis identified a variant in the <GeneName>POLD1</GeneName> gene, p.Ser478Asn alteration, c.1433G&gt;A).  This S478N variant  was identified in two of the originally evaluated families, suggesting evidence of common ancestry.  The validation exercise showed one patient with polyps with the variant but no controls with the variant.  Somatic mutation patterns were similar to the <GeneName>POLE</GeneName> variant.  Several cases of early-onset endometrial cancer were seen.  The mechanism underlying adenoma and carcinoma formation resulting from  the <GeneName>POLE</GeneName>  L424V  variant appeared to be a decrease in the fidelity of replication-associated polymerase proofreading.  This in turn appeared to lead to mutations related to base substitution.</Para><Para id="_2649">The study authors recommend consideration of <GeneName>POLE</GeneName> and <GeneName>POLD1</GeneName> testing in patients with multiple or large adenomas in whom alternatives mutation testing is uninformative and surveillance akin to that afforded patients with LS or MAP.<Reference refidx="220"/><Reference refidx="221"/> <GeneName>POLE</GeneName> and <GeneName>POLD1</GeneName> mutation testing is being incorporated into the new <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000763019">multiple-gene panel tests</GlossaryTermRef>

The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for serrated polyposis (=5  serrated polyps proximal to sigmoid with 2 =1 cm, or any number of polyps proximal to sigmoid if there is a relative with serrated polyposis, or &gt;20 
serrated polyps anywhere in the colon) have never been validated.  Furthermore, no genetic basis has been established, even in the uncommon familial cases.  But cases of oligopolyposis of the serrated variety can initially be challenging to distinguish from oligoadenomatosis, particularly when there is an admixture of adenomas.  Consequently, such patients are increasingly being referred for genetic counseling and for consideration of genetic testing.  Occasional cases of <GeneName>MYH</GeneName> biallelic mutations have been found in patients with at least some features of serrated polyposis and serrated polyps can be seen in LS.

As series of such reports accumulated, certain characteristic clinical features emerged: early age at onset; high risk of second primary tumors; preferential involvement of the right colon; improved clinical outcome; and a range of associated extracolonic sites including the endometrium, ovaries, other sites in the  GI tract, uroepithelium, brain, and skin (sebaceous tumors).  Terms such as <Strong>Lynch 1</Strong> (families with CRC only), <Strong>Lynch 2</Strong> (families with CRC and extracolonic tumors),  <Strong>cancer family syndrome</Strong>, and later, <Strong>hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer</Strong> (<Strong>HNPCC</Strong>), were commonly employed.</Para><Para id="_1090">By 1990, the need for enhanced surveillance (colonoscopy at an early age and repeated frequently) was recognized.  However, the need to limit this aggressive regimen to families most likely to have an inherited susceptibility or “true” HNPCC led to development of the so-called <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_1124" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Amsterdam criteria</SummaryRef>: three or more cases of CRC over two or more generations, with at least one diagnosed before age 50 years, and no evidence of FAP.</Para><Para id="_1091">At about this same time, a chromosomal abnormality on 5q led to detecting genetic linkage between FAP and this genomic region, from which the <GeneName>APC</GeneName> gene was eventually cloned.  This led to searches for similar linkage in HNPCC. The <GeneName>APC</GeneName> gene was one of several genes (along with <GeneName>DCC</GeneName> and <GeneName>MCC</GeneName>) evaluated and to which no HNPCC linkage was found.  An extended genome-wide search resulted in the recognition of a candidate chromosome 2 susceptibility <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460162">locus</GlossaryTermRef> in large HNPCC families in 1993.  Once <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName>, the first HNPCC gene, was sequenced, it was evident (from the somatic mutation patterns in the tumors) that the mismatch repair (MMR) family of genes was likely involved.  Shortly thereafter, additional MMR genes were identified, including <GeneName>MLH1</GeneName>, <GeneName>MSH6</GeneName>, and <GeneName>PMS2</GeneName>.  These MMR genes were formerly referred to as <GeneName>hMSH2</GeneName>, <GeneName>hMLH1</GeneName>, <GeneName>hMSH6</GeneName>, and <GeneName>hPMS2</GeneName>, with the “h” designating them as human homologs; for simplicity, the “h” was dropped.</Para><Para id="_1092">Concurrent with the linkage studies, somatic genetic studies of HNPCC tumors showed evidence of characteristic mutations in microsatellite regions of numerous genes, which appeared to be a molecular marker of MMR deficiency.  This was characterized with synonyms such as <Strong>ubiquitous somatic mutations</Strong>, <Strong>replication errors</Strong>,  and eventually, the currently employed term <Strong>microsatellite instability</Strong> (MSI).  In HNPCC-related tumors showing MSI, there is typically loss of immunohistochemical expression for one or more of the proteins associated with the MMR genes.  Since IHC is relatively easy to perform, it can serve to complement or even supplant MSI screening of suspected HNPCC cases. Although MSI characterizes nearly all HNPCC tumors, it can also occur sporadically in about 12% of CRCs.  These cases clearly do not have the inherited disorder HNPCC, since further studies have shown that the MSI is caused by somatic inactivation of the MLH1 protein by hypermethylation of the <GeneName>MLH1</GeneName> promoter. In most instances, the sporadic nature of these cases can be confirmed by concurrent detection of somatic <GeneName>BRAF</GeneName> mutations in CRC tumor tissue.</Para><Para id="_1093">Mutational testing for germline alterations has been somewhat disappointing, as no more than half of suspected HNPCC cases have detectable pathologic mutations.  Because of this, and the lack of sufficiently specific clinical features, various genetic screening strategies have emerged to improve the yield of genetic testing.  A sufficiently compelling family history, ideally complemented by the presence of MSI, warrants mutational testing, and most clinical practice guidelines provide for such an approach.  The <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_1130" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Bethesda guidelines</SummaryRef> are a combination of clinical, pathologic, and family history features that are sufficiently predictive  to warrant MSI/IHC screening.  Computer risk-assessment profiles have been developed to do this same work more quantifiably and can estimate mutation risk likelihood with or without the intermediate step of using MSI/IHC.</Para><Para id="_1094">Against this background of potential clinical selection criteria for mutation testing, population studies have emerged that can estimate HNPCC frequency (1%–3%) and determine the performance characteristics of these same selection tools when implemented in otherwise unselected cases.</Para><Para id="_1095">The combination of genetic counseling/testing strategies with clinical screening/treatment measures has led to the development of consensus clinical practice guidelines.

</Para><Para id="_1096">Terminology related to familial CRC has certainly evolved.  Most in the field use the term <Strong>Lynch syndrome</Strong> (LS) as a preferred synonym over  HNPCC, since HNPCC is both excessively wordy and misleading—many patients have polyps and many have tumors other than CRC.  In addition, entities such as Muir-Torre syndrome are now recognized as phenotypic variants of LS. Even Turcot syndrome, which was initially thought to only be an FAP variant, is now known to be an LS variant when it presents with glioblastomas and an FAP variant when it presents with medulloblastomas. It has been suggested that the term LS be applied to  cases in which the genetic basis can be confidently linked to a germline mutation in a DNA MMR gene (either a germline mutation is present or can be confidently inferred based on the clinical presentation combined with MSI/IHC).<Reference refidx="227"/></Para><Para id="_1255">The term "familial colorectal cancer type X" or "FCCX" was coined to refer to families who meet Amsterdam criteria but lack MSI/IHC abnormalities.<Reference refidx="228"/>  Some refer to FCCX as “Lynch-like syndrome.” Complicating the terminology further, the term “Lynch-like” has also been used in cases with MSI-H tumors and presumed underlying MMR germline mutation, but in which no such mutation is detected.</Para><Para id="_121">In LS,<Reference refidx="229"/><Reference refidx="230"/><Reference refidx="231"/> unlike FAP, most

LS is an autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by an early age of onset of CRC, excess synchronous and metachronous colorectal neoplasms, right-sided predominance, and extracolonic tumors.  LS is
caused by mutations in the DNA
MMR genes, namely <GeneName>MLH1</GeneName>, <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName>, <GeneName>MSH6</GeneName>, and <GeneName>PMS2</GeneName>. Mutations of the <GeneName>EPCAM</GeneName> gene that result in hypermethylation and silencing of <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName> have also been described.

Because inheritance has been demonstrated in  very few families, performing genetic counseling and genetic testing (which requires specialized research techniques) is particularly challenging.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1163"><Title><GeneName>EPCAM/TACSTD1</GeneName></Title><Para id="_1164">Tumors with MSI and loss of MSH2 protein expression are generally indicative of an underlying <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName> germline mutation (inferred <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName> mutation).

Nevertheless, in at least 30% to 40% of these cases of inferred <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName> mutation, no germline mutation can be detected with state-of-the-art technology.  One Chinese family with tumors showing MSH2 loss was found to have allele-specific hypermethylation that appeared to have been an inherited phenomenon.<Reference refidx="305"/>  Another study of a  family with MSH2-deficient MSI-high tumors  employed the commonly used diagnostic MLPA analysis of MSH6 and also showed reduced expression of MSH6.  In doing so, a decrease in signal was observed for exon 9 of the  <GeneName>EPCAM (TACSTD1)</GeneName> gene, which is near <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName>. Use of additional MLPA probes located between exon 3 of <GeneName>EPCAM</GeneName> and exon 1 of <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName> demonstrated that the deletion spanned most 3’ exons of <GeneName>EPCAM</GeneName>, but spared the <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName> promoter.<Reference refidx="306"/> The mutation in <GeneName>EPCAM</GeneName> was found to induce the observed methylation of the <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName> promoter by transcription across a CpG island within the promoter region.

Using both of these tests increases the sensitivity of the initial screen and improves quality assurance; therefore, many laboratories assess both MSI and IHC initially. However, because these tests are so commonly regarded as simple alternatives, cost-effectiveness considerations seem to support IHC and account for its preferential use. Part of this rationale is that the information provided by IHC may direct testing toward a specific MMR gene (the one with loss of protein expression) as opposed to comprehensive testing that would be necessitated by the use of MSI alone.<Reference refidx="232"/><Reference refidx="233"/><Reference refidx="313"/><Reference refidx="314"/><Reference refidx="315"/><Reference refidx="316"/> Arguments for a sequential approach to increase efficiency have been made.

Although this strategy appears attractive from the standpoint of efficiency, staining for all four MMR proteins remains the  current standard of care. Further studies are necessary to validate the utility of the two-protein approach.

developed colon cancer through a nongenetic mechanism (i.e., it is a sporadic
case), while the other cases in the family are really the result of a germline
mutation.  If this scenario is suspected, testing another affected individual is recommended. Finally, failure to detect a mutation could mean that the family
truly is not at genetic risk despite a clinical presentation that suggests
a genetic basis.  If no mutation can be identified in an affected family
member, testing should not be offered to at-risk members.  They would remain at
increased risk of CRC by virtue of their family history and

The Working Group was commissioned to address the following question:  Do risk assessment and MMR gene mutation testing in individuals with newly diagnosed CRC  lead to improved outcomes for the patient or relatives, or are they useful in medical, personal, or public health decision-making?<Reference refidx="371"/><Reference refidx="372"/> The Working Group constructed economic models to assist in analyzing available evidence on clinical utility in estimating how various testing strategies might function in practice. These included mutation frequency, sensitivity and specificity of both IHC and MSI testing, and the cost of these tests. The performance of these tests is based on the risk of positivity of carrying a mutation including family history, age at diagnosis, and extracolonic cancers.  In 2009, the Working Group reported that there was sufficient evidence to recommend offering genetic testing for LS to individuals with newly diagnosed CRC to reduce morbidity and mortality in relatives.

A 2011 survey of the National Society of Genetic Counselors revealed that more than 25% of respondents had some form of universal screening implemented at their center. Tumor screening methods varied; 34 of 53 (64.2%) started with IHC, 11 of 53 (20.8%) started with MSI testing, and 8 of 53 (15.1%) performed both tests on newly diagnosed colorectal tumors.<Reference refidx="376"/> A 2012 survey suggested that some form of universal screening was being routinely performed at 71% of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) comprehensive cancer centers but that utilization dropped to 15% among a random sample of community hospital cancer programs.<Reference refidx="377"/> NCCN 2014 guidelines support IHC testing of all CRCs diagnosed in patients younger than 70 years if tumor is available and in patients 70 years or older if they meet Bethesda guidelines.<Reference refidx="92"/> Universal screening in all individuals irrespective of age was associated with a doubling of incremental cost per life-year saved compared with screening only those younger than 70 years.<Reference refidx="373"/> The authors of this analysis conclude that screening individuals younger than 70 years appears reasonable, while screening all individuals regardless of age might also be acceptable, depending on societies' willingness to pay.</Para><Para id="_2662">Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility and usefulness of universal screening for LS. Initial experience from one institution found that among 1,566 patients screened using MSI and IHC, 44 (2.8%) patients had LS.  For each proband, an average of three additional family members were subsequently diagnosed with LS.<Reference refidx="232"/>  A subsequent pooled analysis of 10,206 incident CRC patients tested with MSI/IHC as part of four large studies revealed a mutation detection rate of 3.1%.<Reference refidx="378"/> This study compared four strategies for tumor testing for the diagnosis of LS.<Reference refidx="378"/> The strategy of tumor testing all individuals diagnosed with CRC at age 70 years or younger and testing older individuals who met one of the revised Bethesda guidelines yielded a sensitivity of 95.1%,  a specificity of 95.5%, and a diagnostic yield of 2.1%. This strategy missed 4.9% of LS cases, but 34.8% fewer cases required IHC/MSI testing, and 28.6% fewer cases underwent germline testing than in the universal approach.</Para><Para id="_2667">An important implication of universal screening for LS is the reality that it does not result in automatic germline testing in appropriate individuals. Subsequent genetic counseling requires coordination between the pathologist, the referring surgeon or oncologist, and a cancer genetics service. In addition, patient consent and compliance with subsequent testing may significantly influence uptake of genetic counseling.  As an illustration, a population-based screening study found that only 54% of patients with an IHC-deficient tumor (that was <GeneName>BRAF</GeneName> mutation–negative) ultimately consented to and proceeded with germline MMR testing.<Reference refidx="379"/> One institution found 21 deleterious mutations among 1,100 patients who underwent routine MSI and IHC testing after a diagnosis of CRC. This study found markedly increased uptake of genetic counseling and germline MMR gene testing when both the surgeon and a genetic counselor received a copy of abnormal MSI/IHC results, especially when the genetic counselor played an active role in patient follow-up.<Reference refidx="380"/></Para><Para id="_2664">To simplify the process of IHC testing and to help decrease cost, a strategy that employs IHC testing for <GeneName>PMS2</GeneName> and <GeneName>M
SH6</GeneName>  alone has been suggested. This strategy relies on the binding properties of the MMR heterodimer complexes, by which gene mutation and loss of <GeneName>MLH1</GeneName> and <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName> invariably result in the degradation of 
<GeneName>PMS2</GeneName> and <GeneName>MSH6</GeneName>, respectively, but the converse is not true.<Reference refidx="318"/> The authors do not suggest a definitive algorithm after the finding of an IHC-deficient tumor.  However, given the predominance of <GeneName>MLH1</GeneName> and <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName> mutations in LS, the authors suggest that a <GeneName>PMS2</GeneName>-deficient tumor should be investigated for either <GeneName>MLH1</GeneName> hypermethylation (utilizing 
<GeneName>BRAF</GeneName> mutations status as a proxy) or germline <GeneName>MLH1</GeneName> mutation analysis.  Similarly, <GeneName>MSH6</GeneName> deficiency would generally result in <GeneName>MSH2</GeneName> germline testing as a first step. This strategy has not been validated or widely adopted in clinical practice.</Para><Para id="_2550">There is an ongoing discussion about best practices for the informed consent process for this tumor testing.<Reference refidx="381"/> Identification of genetic predisposition to cancer generally mandates explicit informed consent because of concerns for the possibility of insurance discrimination (irrespective of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008), adverse psychological outcomes, and costs associated with further testing.<Reference refidx="382"/><Reference refidx="383"/>  The EGAPP working group specifically recommends obtaining informed consent for MSI or IHC testing.<Reference refidx="371"/> Nevertheless, debate about this issue continues, partially because of pragmatic concerns surrounding the feasibility of obtaining such consent before the procedure. One proposed approach suggests a preparatory conversation informing patients before their procedure that CRC runs in families and that if their tumor has features characteristic of a heritable type, they will be contacted by a genetic health care provider for further assessment of the genetic basis of their cancer.<Reference refidx="381"/> A cross-sectional survey of U.S. cancer programs (20 NCI–designated comprehensive cancer centers and 49 community hospital cancer programs) found that, of those that performed MSI and/or IHC testing as part of standard pathologic evaluation at the time of colon cancer diagnosis in all or select cases, none required written informed consent before tumor testing.<Reference refidx="377"/></Para><Para id="_1365">(Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062865#_226" url="/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/risk-assessment-pdq">Informed Consent</SummaryRef> section in  the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062865" url="/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/risk-assessment-pdq">Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling</SummaryRef> for more information.)</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1322"><Title>Diagnostic strategies for all individuals diagnosed with endometrial cancer</Title><Para id="_1323">Based on a Markov mathematical model, a strategy of performing IHC for MMR protein expression in all patients with endometrial cancer, irrespective of the age  at diagnosis, who have a first-degree relative with endometrial cancer, was reported to be cost-effective in the detection of LS in patients with LS-related cancer.<Reference refidx="384"/> (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_1019" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Genetic testing</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information about performing IHC for MMR protein expression.)

In this model, the strategy of performing IHC on the tumor from all patients diagnosed with LS-related cancer who have a first-degree relative with endometrial cancer had an incremental cost ratio of $9,126 per year of life gained relative to the least-costly strategy, which was genetic testing on all women diagnosed with endometrial cancer younger than 50 years with at least one first-degree relative with LS-related cancer.  </Para><Para id="_1401">The model predicted that if all endometrial cancers in the United States (estimated to be 45,000 new cases in 2010) underwent IHC screening, 827 women (1.84%) would be diagnosed as LS patients.<Reference refidx="384"/>  However, applying the strategy of testing only those endometrial tumors of patients with at least a first-degree relative with LS-related cancer, 755  affected individuals (1.68%) would be identified.  If the Amsterdam II criteria were applied, 539 carriers (1.2%) would be identified.  The authors stated that the incremental benefit of the most cost-effective strategy was associated with an average life expectancy gain of only 1 day compared with testing by Amsterdam II criteria. However, they argue that this may be significant, as it is comparable to the life expectancy gain from triennial cervical cancer screening, which is a current recommendation from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists for women older than 30 years in the general population.  </Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_270"><Title>Interventions for LS

At a mean follow-up of 55.7 months (range: 1–128 mo), 53 primary CRCs developed in 48 participants  (18 of 427 in the aspirin group and 30 of 434 in the aspirin placebo group).  Seventy-six patients who refused randomization to the aspirin groups (because of an aspirin sensitivity or a history of peptic ulcer disease) were randomly assigned to receive resistant starch or resistant starch placebo.  The intention-to-treat analysis yielded an HR for CRC of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.35–1.13; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .12). However, five of the patients who developed CRC developed two primary colon cancers.  A Poisson regression was performed to account for the effect of the multiple primary CRCs and yielded a protective effect for aspirin (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32–0.99; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .05).   For participants who completed at least 2 years of treatment, the per-protocol analysis yielded an HR of 0.41 (95% CI, 0.19–0.86; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .02) and an IRR of 0.37 (0.18–0.78; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .008).  An analysis of all LS cancers (endometrial, ovarian, pancreatic, small bowel, gall bladder, ureter, stomach, kidney, and brain) revealed a protective effect of aspirin versus placebo (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.42–1.00;<Emphasis> P</Emphasis> = .05).  There were no significant differences in adverse events between the aspirin and placebo groups, and no serious adverse effects were noted with any treatment.  The authors concluded that 600 mg of aspirin per day for a mean of 25 months substantially reduced cancer incidence in LS patients.  CAPP2 failed to show any effect from daily resistant starch intake. A limitation of the trial is that the frequency of surveillance studies at the various centers was not reported as being standardized.  Earlier CAPP2 trial results for 746 LS patients enrolled in the study were published in 2008 <Reference refidx="401"/> and failed to show a significant preventive effect on incident colonic adenomas or carcinomas (relative risk [RR], 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7–1.4) with a shorter mean follow-up of 29 months (range: 7–74 mo).  The <ExternalRef xref="http://www.capp3.org/">CAPP3</ExternalRef> trial, which is  evaluating the effect of lower doses of aspirin (blinded 100 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg enteric-coated aspirin), began in 2013 is expected to enroll approximately 3,000 mutation carriers by about 2021.<Reference refidx="402"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_279"><Title>Screening for endometrial cancer in LS families</Title><Para id="_280">Note: A separate PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062819" url="/types/uterine/hp/endometrial-screening-pdq">Endometrial Cancer Screening</SummaryRef> in the general

</Para><Para id="_281">Cancer of the endometrium is the second most common cancer observed in LS
families with initial estimates of cumulative risk in LS carriers of 30% to
39% by age 70 years.<Reference refidx="251"/><Reference refidx="253"/>  In a large Finnish study of 293 putative LS gene
carriers, the cumulative lifetime risk of endometrial cancer was 43%. 
Endometrial cancer risk was directly related to age, ranging from 3.7% at age
40 years to 42.6% by age 80 years, compared with a 3% endometrial cancer risk in the general
population.<Reference refidx="235"/>  The maximal risk of endometrial cancer in LS families occurs
15 years earlier than in the general population, with the highest risk
occurring between ages 55 and 65 years. In a community study of unselected endometrial cancer patients in central Ohio, at least 1.8% (95% CI, 0.9%–3.5%) of newly diagnosed patients had LS.<Reference refidx="403"/> Adenocarcinomas of the lower uterine segment may carry a greater risk of manifesting LS.<Reference refidx="404"/></Para><Para id="_755">In the general population, the diagnosis of endometrial cancer is generally made when women present with symptoms including abnormal or postmenopausal bleeding. An office endometrial sampling, or a dilatation and curettage (D&amp;C), is then performed, providing a histologic specimen for diagnosis. Eighty percent of women with endometrial cancer present with symptoms of stage I disease. There are no data suggesting the clinical presentation in women with LS differs from the general population.</Para><Para id="_282">Given their substantial increased risk of endometrial cancer, endometrial screening for women with LS has been suggested. Proposed modalities for screening include transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and/or endometrial biopsy.   Although the Pap test occasionally leads to a diagnosis of endometrial cancer, the sensitivity is too low
for it to be a useful screening test.  The presence of endometrial cells in a
Pap smear obtained from a postmenopausal woman not taking hormone replacement
therapy is abnormal and warrants further investigation.<Reference refidx="405"/><Reference refidx="406"/> Two studies have examined the use of TVUS in endometrial screening for women with LS.<Reference refidx="407"/><Reference refidx="408"/> In one study of 292 women from LS or LS-like families, no cases of endometrial cancer were detected by TVUS. In addition, two interval cancers developed in symptomatic women.<Reference refidx="407"/> In a second study, 41 women with LS were enrolled in a TVUS screening program. Of 179 TVUS procedures performed, there were 17 abnormal scans. Three of the 17 women had complex atypical hyperplasia on endometrial sampling, while 14  had normal endometrial sampling. However, TVUS failed to identify one patient who presented 8 months after a normal TVUS with abnormal vaginal bleeding, and was found to have stage IB endometrial cancer.<Reference refidx="408"/>  Both of these studies concluded that TVUS is neither sensitive or specific. A study of 175 women with LS,  which included both endometrial sampling and TVUS, showed that endometrial sampling improved sensitivity over TVUS. Endometrial sampling found 11 of the 14 cases of endometrial cancer. Two of the three other cases were interval cancers that developed in symptomatic women and one case was an occult endometrial cancer found at the time of  hysterectomy.  Endometrial sampling also identified 14 additional cases of endometrial hyperplasia. Among the group of 14 women with endometrial cancer, ten also had  TVUS screening with endometrial sampling. Four of the ten had abnormal TVUS, but six had normal TVUS.<Reference refidx="409"/> While this cohort study demonstrates that endometrial sampling may have benefits over TVUS for endometrial screening, there are no data that predict screening with any other modality has benefits for endometrial cancer survival in women with LS. Given the favorable survival for endometrial cancer diagnosed by symptoms, it is unlikely that a sufficiently powered screening study will be able to demonstrate a survival advantage. Certainly, women with LS should be counseled that abnormal or postmenopausal vaginal bleeding warrants an endometrial sampling or D&amp;C.</Para><Para id="_285">Routine screening for endometrial cancer has not been shown to be beneficial in
the general population, but expert consensus suggests that it be considered in
women who are members of high-risk LS families.  Some studies suggest that women with a clinical or genetic diagnosis of LS do not universally adopt intensive gynecologic screening.<Reference refidx="410"/><Reference refidx="411"/> (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_558" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">Gynecologic cancer screening in LS</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information.) Despite absence of a survival advantage, a task force organized by
NIH has suggested annual
endometrial sampling beginning at age 30 to 35
years. TVUS can also be considered annually to evaluate the ovaries.<Reference refidx="387"/><Reference refidx="412"/></Para><Para id="_973">The published literature on TVUS for endometrial cancer screening has shown it to be insensitive and nonspecific, but because there may still be a role for TVUS in ovarian cancer screening, clinical practice guidelines have been reluctant to date to recommend against TVUS.</Para><Para id="_286"><LOERef href="CDR0000526280">Level of evidence: 5</LOERef></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_291"><Title>Surgical management in LS</Title><Para id="_2682">One of the hallmarks of LS is the presence of synchronous and metachronous CRCs. The incidence of metachronous CRCs has been reported to be 16% at 10 years, 41% at 20 years, and 63% at 30 years after segmental colectomy.<Reference refidx="413"/> Because of the increased incidence of synchronous and metachronous neoplasms, the treatment of choice for a patient with LS with neoplastic lesions in the colon is generally an extended colectomy (total or subtotal). Nevertheless, treatment has to be individualized. Mathematical models suggest that there are minimal benefits of extended procedures in individuals older than 67 years, compared with  the benefits seen in younger individuals with early-onset cancer. In one Markov decision analysis model, the survival advantage for a young individual with early-onset CRC undergoing an extended procedure could be up to 4 years longer than that seen in the same individual undergoing a segmental resection.<Reference refidx="414"/> The recommendation for an extended procedure must be balanced with the comorbidities of the patient, the clinical stage of the disease, the wishes of the patient, and surgical expertise. No prospective or retrospective study has shown a survival advantage for patients with LS who underwent an extended resection versus a segmental procedure.  Two studies have shown that patients who undergo extended procedures have fewer metachronous CRCs and additional surgical procedures related to CRC than do patients who undergo segmental resections.<Reference refidx="413"/><Reference refidx="415"/> Balancing functional results of an extended procedure versus a segmental procedure is of paramount importance. Although the majority of patients adapt well after an abdominal colectomy, some patients will require antidiarrheal medication. A decision model compared quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for a 30-year-old patient undergoing an abdominal colectomy versus a segmental colectomy.<Reference refidx="416"/> In this model, there was not much difference between the extended and segmental procedure, with QALYs being 0.3 years more in patients undergoing a segmental procedure than in those undergoing an extended procedure.<Reference refidx="416"/></Para><Para id="_2683">When considering surgical options, it is important to recognize that a subtotal or total colectomy will not eliminate the rectal cancer risk. The lifetime risk of developing cancer in the rectal remnant after an abdominal colectomy has been reported to be 12% at 12 years post-colectomy.<Reference refidx="417"/> In addition to the general complications of surgery, there are the potential risks of urinary and sexual dysfunction and diarrhea after an extended colectomy, with these risks being greater the more distal the anastomosis. Therefore, the choice of surgery must be made on an individual basis by the surgeon and the patient.</Para><Para id="_2684">In patients with LS and rectal cancer, similar surgical options (extended vs. segmental resection) and considerations must be given. Extended procedures include restorative proctocolectomy and IPAA if the sphincter can be saved or proctocolectomy with loop ileostomy if the sphincter cannot be saved. Two retrospectives studies reported a 15% and 18%  incidence of metachronous colon cancer after segmental rectal cancer–resection in patients with LS.<Reference refidx="418"/><Reference refidx="419"/> In one of the studies, the combined risk of metachronous high-risk adenomas and cancers was 51% at a median follow-up of 101.7 months after proctectomy.<Reference refidx="419"/></Para><Para id="_2686">There are no data about fertility in LS patients based on type of surgery. In FAP patients, no difference in fecundity after abdominal colectomy and IRA has been reported, whereas there is a 54% decrease in fecundity in patients who undergo restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anastomosis compared with the general population.<Reference refidx="420"/> </Para><Para id="_2685">Most clinicians who treat patients with LS will favor an extended procedure at the time of CRC diagnosis. However, as stated above, the choice of surgery must be made on an individual basis by the surgeon and the patient.

Modern high-resolution endoscopes improve adenoma detection yield, but the use of various vital dyes, especially indigo carmine dye-spray, has further improved detection.  Several studies have shown that the improved mucosal contrast achieved with the use of indigo carmine can improve the adenoma detection rate. Whether family history is significant or not, careful clinical evaluation consisting of dye-spray colonoscopy (indigo carmine or methylene blue),<Reference refidx="424"/><Reference refidx="425"/><Reference refidx="426"/><Reference refidx="427"/><Reference refidx="428"/><Reference refidx="429"/><Reference refidx="430"/> with or without magnification, or possibly newer imaging techniques such as narrow-band imaging,<Reference refidx="431"/> may reveal the characteristic right-sided clustering of more numerous microadenomas.

In this series, no significant difference in adenoma yield between the chromoendoscopy and intensive white-light groups was detected.  However, these patients were younger and in many cases had undergone several previous exams that might have resulted in polyp clearing.</Para><Para id="_1373">In a German study,<Reference refidx="437"/> one series of LS patients underwent white-light exam followed by chromoendoscopy, while a second series underwent colonoscopy with narrow-band imaging followed by chromoendoscopy.  Significant differences in flat polyp detection favored chromoendoscopy in both series, although some of the detected lesions were hyperplastic.  In a French series of LS subjects  that  also employed white-light exam followed by chromoendoscopy, significantly more adenomas were detected with chromoendoscopy.<Reference refidx="438"/></Para><Para id="_1374">Fewer evaluations of chromoendoscopy have been performed in  attenuated FAP than in LS.  One study  examined four patients with presumed AFAP and fewer than 20 adenomas upon white-light examination.<Reference refidx="439"/>  All had more than 1,000 diminutive adenomas found on chromoendoscopy, in agreement with pathology evaluation after colectomy.</Para><Para id="_1375">A similar role for chromoendoscopy has been suggested to evaluate the duodenum in FAP.

Overall Spigelman score was not significantly affected.<Reference refidx="440"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1376"><Title>Small bowel imaging</Title><Para id="_1377">Patients with PJS and juvenile polyposis syndrome are at greater risk of disease-related complications in the small bowel (e.g., bleeding, obstruction, intussusception, or cancer).  FAP patients, although at great risk of duodenal neoplasia, have a relatively low risk of jejunoileal involvement.  The RR of small bowel malignancy is very high in LS, but absolute risk is less than 10%.  Although the risks of small bowel neoplasia are high enough to warrant consideration of surveillance in each disease, the technical challenges of doing so have been daunting. Because of the technical challenges and relatively low prevalences, there is virtually no evidence base for small-bowel screening in LS.</Para><Para id="_1378">Historically, the relative endoscopic inaccessibility of the mid and distal small bowel required radiographic measures for its evaluation, including the barium small bowel series or a variant called tube enteroclysis, in which a nasogastroduodenal tube is placed so that all of the contrast goes into the small intestine for more precise imaging.  None of these measures were sensitive for small lesions. Any therapeutic undertaking required laparotomy.  This entailed resection in most cases, although intraoperative endoscopy, with or without enterotomy for scope access, has been available for many years. Peroral enteroscopy (aided by stiffening overtubes with two balloons, one balloon, or spiral ribs) has been employed to overcome the technical problem of excessive looping, enabling deep jejunal access with therapeutic (polypectomy) potential.</Para><Para id="_1379">Most data relate that PJS with double-balloon enteroscopy is the preferred  method for endoscopy of the small bowel.<Reference refidx="441"/>  This may involve only peroral enteroscopy, although subsequent retrograde enteroscopy has been described for more complete evaluation of the total small bowel.  Because these procedures are time-consuming and involve some risk of complication, deep enteroscopy is usually preceded by more noninvasive imaging, including traditional barium exams, capsule endoscopy, and CT or magnetic resonance enterography.<Reference refidx="80"/></Para><Para id="_1380">In FAP, data from capsule endoscopy <Reference refidx="80"/> show a 50% to 100% prevalence of jejunal and/or ileal polyps in patients with Spigelman stage III or stage IV duodenal involvement but virtually no such polyps in Spigelman stage I or stage II disease.  All polyps were smaller than 10 mm and were not biopsied or removed.  Consequently, their clinical significance remains uncertain but is likely limited, given the infrequency of jejunoileal cancer reports in FAP.</Para><Para id="_1381">Capsule endoscopy in the small series of PJS patients described above <Reference refidx="80"/> showed the presence of a similar frequency (50%–100%) of polyps, but the prevalent polyps were much larger than in FAP, were more likely to become symptomatic, and warranted endoscopic or surgical excision.  Capsule studies were suggested as an appropriate replacement for radiographic studies because of  the sensitivity of capsule.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_166"><Title>Familial CRC </Title><Para id="_168">An estimated 7% to 10% of people have a first-degree relative with CRC,<Reference refidx="442"/><Reference refidx="443"/> and approximately twice that many have either a first-degree or a
second-degree relative with CRC.<Reference refidx="443"/><Reference refidx="444"/> A simple family history of CRC (defined as one or more close relatives with
CRC in the absence of a known hereditary colon cancer) confers a
twofold to sixfold increase in risk.  The risk associated with family history
varies greatly according to the age of onset of CRC in the family
members, the number of affected relatives, the closeness of the genetic
relationship (e.g., first-degree relatives), and whether cancers have occurred
across generations.<Reference refidx="442"/><Reference refidx="445"/> A positive family history of CRC appears to increase the risk of CRC earlier in life such that at age 45 years, the annual incidence is more than three times higher than that in average-risk people; at age 70 years, the risk is similar to that in average-risk individuals.<Reference refidx="442"/> The incidence in a 35- to 40-year-old is about the same as that of an average-risk person at age 50 years. There is no evidence to suggest that CRC in people with one affected first-degree relative is more likely to be proximal or is more rapidly progressive.  
</Para><Para id="_171">A personal history of adenomatous polyps confers a 15% to 20%
risk of subsequently developing polyps <Reference refidx="446"/>   and increases the risk of CRC in relatives.<Reference refidx="447"/>  The RR of CRC, adjusted for the year of birth and sex, was 1.78  (95% CI, 1.18–2.67) for the parents and siblings of the patients with adenomas as compared with the spouse controls. The RR for siblings of patients in whom adenomas were diagnosed before age 60 years was 2.59 (95% CI, 1.46–4.58),  compared with the siblings of patients who were 60 years or older at the time of diagnosis and after adjustment for the sibling's year of birth and sex, with  a parental history of CRC. 
 </Para><Para id="_542">While familial clusters  account for approximately 20% of all CRC cases in developed countries,<Reference refidx="448"/> the rare and highly penetrant Mendelian CRC diseases contribute to only a fraction of familial cases, which suggests that other genes and/or shared environmental factors may contribute to the remainder of the cancers.  Two studies attempted to determine the degree to which hereditary factors contribute to familial CRCs.</Para><Para id="_543">The first study utilized the Swedish, Danish, and Finnish twin registries that cumulatively provided 44,788 pairs of same-sex twins (for men: 7,231 monozygotic [MZ] and 13,769 dizygotic [DZ] pairs; for women:  8,437 MZ and 15,351 DZ pairs) to study the contribution of heritable and environmental factors involved in 11 different  cancers.<Reference refidx="449"/> The twins included in the study all resided in their respective countries of origin into adulthood (&gt;50 years). Cancers were identified through their respective national cancer registries in 10,803 individuals from 9,512 pairs of twins.  The premise of the study was based on the fact that MZ twins share 100% and DZ twins share 50% of their genes on average for any individual twin pair.  This study calculated that heritable factors accounted for 35%, shared environmental factors for 5%, and nonshared environmental factors for 60% of the risk of CRC.  For CRC, the estimated heritability was only slightly greater in younger groups than in older groups.  This study revealed that although nonshared environmental factors constitute the major risk of familial CRC, heredity plays a larger-than-expected role.</Para><Para id="_544">The second study utilized the Swedish Family-Cancer Database, which contained 6,773 and 31,100 CRCs in offspring and their parents, respectively, from 1991 to 2000.<Reference refidx="450"/> The database included 253,467 pairs of spouses, who were married and lived together for at least 30 years, and who were used to control for common environmental effects on cancer risk.  The overall SIR for cancers of the colon, rectum, and colon and rectum combined in the offspring of an affected parent was 1.81 (95% CI, 1.62–2.02), 1.74 (95% CI, 1.53–1.96), and 1.78 (95% CI, 1.53–1.96), respectively. The risk conferred by affected siblings was also significantly elevated.  Because there was no significantly increased risk of CRC conferred between spouses, the authors concluded that heredity plays a significant role in familial CRCs; however, controls for shared environmental effects among siblings were absent in this study.</Para><Para id="_696">Ten percent to 15% of persons with CRC and/or colorectal adenomas have other affected family members,<Reference refidx="442"/><Reference refidx="443"/><Reference refidx="445"/><Reference refidx="446"/><Reference refidx="447"/><Reference refidx="451"/><Reference refidx="452"/><Reference refidx="453"/><Reference refidx="454"/><Reference refidx="455"/><Reference refidx="456"/> but their  findings do not fit the criteria for FAP, and their family histories may or may not meet clinical criteria for LS. Such families are categorized as having familial CRC, which is currently a diagnosis of exclusion (of known hereditary CRC disorders). The presence of CRC in more than one family member may be caused by hereditary factors, shared environmental risk factors, or even chance.

average-risk people should be screened starting at age 50 years, suggest that
screening should begin earlier in life (e.g., at age 35–40 years) when the
magnitude of risk is comparable to that of a 50-year-old.  Because the risk
increases with the extent of family history, there is room for clinical judgment in
favor of even earlier screening, depending on the details of the family
history.

Linkage analysis of Ashkenazi Jewish families with HMPS revealed shared haplotypes on chromosome 15q13.3.<Reference refidx="527"/>  An unusual heterozygous 40kb single-copy duplication was discovered upstream of <GeneName>gremlin 1</GeneName> (<GeneName>GREM1</GeneName>) that segregated perfectly with individuals and family members with HMPS and not with unaffected controls.<Reference refidx="527"/>  The presence of this duplication in HMPS individuals was associated with increased expression of <GeneName>GREM1</GeneName> transcript levels in the normal intestinal epithelium.<Reference refidx="527"/>  <GeneName>GREM1</GeneName> is a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist and thus theoretically would promote the stem cell phenotype in the intestine.

The wide range of uptake rates suggests that factors such as cost, test characteristics, and the context in which counseling and testing were offered may have influenced participants’ decisions. For example, among studies that offered free genetic counseling and testing in the context of a research protocol, counseling uptake ranged from 21% to 59%, and testing uptake ranged from 36% to 59%.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> Most of those who had participated in a free pretest counseling or education session almost always 
followed through with genetic testing. Further research is needed to evaluate LS genetic counseling and testing participation in the clinical setting.
</Para><Para id="_209">Although limited in number, these studies offer insight into why individuals
from families at risk of LS decide to undergo or decline genetic counseling and
testing. Participation in LS genetic counseling was associated with having children, having a greater number of relatives affected by CRC, and greater social support.<Reference refidx="6"/>  A study of CRC patients who had donated a blood sample for genetic testing also showed that those who intended to follow through with receiving results were more worried that they carried a LS-predisposing gene mutation, believed that testing would help family members, and more strongly endorsed the benefits and importance of having testing.<Reference refidx="4"/> Factors associated with both counseling and testing uptake included having: children, a greater number of affected relatives, a greater perceived risk of developing CRC, and more frequent thoughts about CRC.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_494">Less is known about the characteristics of persons who decide to not undergo LS genetic counseling and testing.  Studies have found that persons who declined counseling and testing reported to have a lower perceived risk of CRC,<Reference refidx="1"/> to have fewer first-degree relatives affected with cancer,<Reference refidx="7"/> to be less likely to have had a previous colonoscopy,<Reference refidx="1"/> to have a college education,<Reference refidx="2"/>  to have previously participated in cancer genetics research,<Reference refidx="2"/> or to be employed.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Psychological factors also may limit the uptake of genetic counseling and testing. Those who declined counseling and testing, especially women, reported a lower perceived ability to cope with mutation-positive test results,<Reference refidx="1"/> and were more likely to report having depressive symptoms.<Reference refidx="2"/> Reasons cited for not seeking genetic counseling or testing have included concerns about potential insurance discrimination, how genetic testing would affect one's family, and how one would emotionally handle genetic test results.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_213">In contrast to the LS genetic counseling and testing uptake studies that
have been conducted in the United States, findings from similar studies
conducted in other countries may differ.  A Finnish study found that 75%
of individuals at risk of developing LS underwent genetic testing and
counseling for disclosure of test results.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Being employed was the only
factor that independently predicted test uptake.  Fundamental differences
between U.S. and Finnish health care systems may have accounted for
the substantial differences in testing uptake in this study compared with similar
ones conducted in the United States.  In particular, the lower likelihood of
health or life insurance discrimination in a European state such as Finland may
have eliminated an important barrier to testing in that setting.<Reference refidx="5"/>
</Para><Para id="_1109">The majority of these studies that evaluated the uptake of genetic testing for LS have focused on genetic testing for mismatch repair (MMR) mutations associated with this syndrome.  Few studies have examined uptake of microsatellite instability  (MSI) and immunohistochemical (IHC) testing.  One study reported low levels of knowledge and awareness of MSI testing among a sample of CRC patients who met the revised Bethesda guidelines for LS and were offered MSI testing.<Reference refidx="12"/>   Patients in this study generally reported positive attitudes about the benefits of MSI testing; however, patients with higher levels of cancer-specific distress also perceived a greater number of barriers to having MSI testing.</Para><Para id="_870">Research is emerging on the usefulness of decision aids for LS genetic testing. One study showed that a decision aid, in booklet format, was effective in reducing uncertainty about the testing decision, assisting individuals to make an informed decision about testing, and improving testing knowledge among men. However, the decision aid did not appear to influence actual testing decisions.<Reference refidx="13"/> Another study evaluated the impact of an educational intervention in high-risk CRC patients before MSI and IHC testing but not MMR mutation testing.  Patients who received a brief educational session delivered by a health educator plus a CD-ROM decision aid about MSI and IHC testing were found to have greater increases in knowledge about testing, higher satisfaction with preparation for decision-making about testing, lower decisional conflict, and greater decisional self-efficacy compared with patients who received only a brief educational session.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_482"><Title>FAP</Title><Para id="_214">The uptake for genetic testing for FAP may be higher than testing for LS.  A
study of asymptomatic individuals in the United States at risk of FAP who were
enrolled in a CRC registry and were offered genetic counseling
found that 82% of adults and 95% of minors underwent genetic testing.<Reference refidx="10"/> 
Uptake rates close to 100% have been reported in the United Kingdom.<Reference refidx="15"/> A possible explanation for the greater uptake of <GeneName>APC</GeneName> genetic testing is that it
may be more cost-effective than annual endoscopic screening <Reference refidx="16"/> and can
eliminate the burden of annual screening, which must often be initiated before
puberty.  The opportunity to eliminate worry about potential risk-reducing
surgery is another possible benefit of  genetic testing for FAP.  The decision to
have <GeneName>APC</GeneName> genetic testing may be viewed as a medical management
decision;<Reference refidx="17"/> the potential psychosocial factors that may influence the
testing decision are not as well studied for FAP as for other hereditary cancer syndromes.  
The higher <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339344">penetrance</GlossaryTermRef> of <GeneName>APC</GeneName> mutations and earlier onset of disease also may influence the decision to undergo genetic testing for this condition, possibly because of a greater awareness of the disease and more experience with multiple family members being affected.</Para><Para id="_2632">Genetic testing for FAP is presently offered to children with affected parents, often at the age of 10 to 12 years, when endoscopic screening is recommended. Because it is optimal to diagnose FAP before age 18 years to prevent CRC and because screening and possibly surgery are warranted at the time an individual is identified as an <GeneName>APC</GeneName> mutation carrier, genetic testing of minors is justified in this instance.  (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062865#_233" url="/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/risk-assessment-pdq">Testing in children</SummaryRef> section in the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062865" url="/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/risk-assessment-pdq">Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling</SummaryRef> for a more detailed discussion regarding the ethical, psychosocial, and genetic counseling issues related to genetic testing in children.)</Para><Para id="_2633">In a survey conducted in the Netherlands of members of families with FAP, one-third (34%) believed that it was most suitable to offer <GeneName>APC</GeneName> gene testing to children before age 12 years, whereas 38% preferred to offer testing to children between the ages of 12 and 16 years, when children would be better able to understand the DNA testing process. Only 4% felt that children should not undergo DNA testing at all.<Reference refidx="18"/></Para><Para id="_2634">Results of qualitative interview data from 28 U.S. parents diagnosed with FAP showed that 61% favored genetic testing of APC mutations in their at-risk children (aged 10–17 years); 71% believed that their children should receive their test results. The primary reasons why parents chose to test their children included early detection and management, reduction in parental anxiety and uncertainty, and help with decision making regarding surveillance. Reasons provided for not testing focused on discrimination concerns and cost.<Reference refidx="19"/></Para><Para id="_2635">Clinical observations suggest that children who
have family members affected with FAP are very aware of the possibility of
risk-reducing surgery, and focus on the test result as the factor that
determines the need for such surgery.<Reference refidx="10"/>  It is important to consider the
timing of disclosure of genetic test results to children in regard to their age, developmental issues, and psychological concerns about FAP.  Children who carry an FAP mutation have
expressed concern regarding how they will be perceived by peers and might
benefit from assistance in formulating an explanation for others that preserves
self-esteem.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1106"><Title>Interest in the Use of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART)</Title><Para id="_1107">The possibility of transmitting a mutation to a child may pose a concern to families affected by hereditary CRC syndromes to the extent that some carriers may avoid childbearing. These concerns also may prompt individuals to consider using prenatal diagnosis (PND) methods to help reduce the risk of transmission. PND is an encompassing term used to refer to any medical procedure conducted to assess the presence of a genetic disorder in a fetus.

A small proportion of respondents (16%) reported experiencing some FAP-related discrimination, primarily indicating that attending to their medical or self-care needs (e.g., time off work for screening, need for frequent toilet breaks, and physical limitations) may engender negative attitudes in colleagues and managers.</Para><Para id="_1304">Another large cross-sectional study of FAP families conducted in the Netherlands included persons aged 16 to 84 years who either had an FAP diagnosis, were at 50% risk of having an <GeneName>APC</GeneName> mutation, or were proven <GeneName>APC</GeneName> noncarriers.<Reference refidx="47"/>  Of those who had <GeneName>APC</GeneName> testing, 48% had done so at least 5 years or longer before this study.  Of persons with an FAP diagnosis, 76% had undergone preventive colectomy, and 78% of those were at least 5 years postsurgery.  The study evaluated the prevalence of generalized psychological distress, distress related specifically to FAP, and cancer-related worries.  Mean scores on the Mental Health Index-5, a subscale of the SF-36 that assessed generalized distress, were comparable to the general Dutch population. Twenty percent of respondents were classified as having moderate to high levels of FAP-specific distress as measured by the Impact of Event scale (IES), with 23% of those with an FAP diagnosis, 11% of those at risk of FAP, and 17% of noncarriers reporting scores in this range.  Five percent reported scores on the IES that indicated severe and clinically relevant distress; of those, the majority (78%) had an FAP diagnosis.  Overall, mean scores on the Cancer Worry Scale were comparable to those found in another study of families with LS.  Persons with an FAP diagnosis were more likely to report more frequent cancer worries, and the most commonly reported worries were the potential need for additional surgery (26%) and the likelihood that they (17%) or a family member (14%) will develop cancer.  In multivariate analysis, factors associated with higher levels of FAP-specific distress included greater perceived risk of developing cancer, more frequent discussion about FAP with family or friends, and having no children.  Factors associated with higher levels of cancer-specific worries included being female, poorer family functioning, greater actual and desired discussion about FAP with family or friends, greater perceived cancer risk, poorer general health perceptions, and having been a caregiver for a family member with cancer. The authors noted that most factors that were associated with higher levels of cancer- and FAP-specific distress or worry were psychosocial factors, rather than clinical or demographic factors. </Para><Para id="_1104">Another cross-sectional study conducted in the Netherlands found that among FAP patients, 37% indicated that the disease had influenced their desire to have children (i.e., wanting fewer or no children).  Thirty-three percent indicated that they would consider PND for FAP; 30% would consider PGD. Higher levels of guilt and more positive attitudes towards terminating pregnancy were associated with greater interest for both PND and PGD.<Reference refidx="18"/> In a separate U.S. study, predictors of willingness to consider prenatal testing included having an affected child and experiencing a first-degree relative’s death secondary to FAP.<Reference refidx="25"/></Para><Para id="_220">The psychological vulnerability of children undergoing testing is of particular concern in genetic testing for FAP.  Research findings suggest that most children do not experience clinically significant psychological distress after <GeneName>APC</GeneName> testing.  As in studies involving adults, however, subgroups may be vulnerable to increased distress and would benefit from continued psychological support.  A study of children who had undergone  genetic testing
for FAP found that their mood and behavior remained in the normal range after genetic
counseling and disclosure of test results. Aspects of the family situation, including illness in the mother or a sibling were associated with subclinical increases in depressive symptoms.<Reference refidx="48"/> In a long-term follow-up study of 48 children undergoing testing for FAP, most children did not suffer psychological distress; however,  a small proportion of children tested demonstrated clinically significant posttest distress.<Reference refidx="49"/> Another study found that although <GeneName>APC</GeneName> mutation–positive children’s perceived risk of developing the disease increased after disclosure of results, anxiety and depression levels remain unchanged in the year after disclosure.<Reference refidx="44"/>  Mutation-negative children in this study experienced less anxiety and improved self-esteem over this same time period.

It is generally accepted that communication about genetic risk information within families is largely the responsibility of family members themselves.  A few studies have examined communication patterns in families who had been offered LS genetic counseling and testing.  Studies have focused on whether individuals disclosed information about LS genetic testing to their family members, to whom they disclosed this information, and family-based characteristics or issues that might facilitate or inhibit such communication. These studies examined communication and disclosure processes in families after notification by health care professionals about a LS predisposition and have comprised relatively small samples.</Para><Para id="_707">Research findings indicate that persons generally are willing to share information about the presence of a LS-<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460208">predisposing mutation</GlossaryTermRef> within their families.<Reference refidx="67"/><Reference refidx="68"/><Reference refidx="69"/><Reference refidx="70"/> Motivations for sharing genetic risk information include a desire to increase family awareness about personal risk, health promotion options and predictive genetic testing, a desire for emotional support, and a perceived moral obligation and responsibility to help others in the family.<Reference refidx="68"/><Reference refidx="69"/><Reference refidx="70"/>  Findings across studies suggest that most study participants believed that LS genetic risk information is shared openly within families; however, such communication is more likely to occur with first-degree relatives (e.g., siblings, children) than with more distant relatives.<Reference refidx="67"/><Reference refidx="68"/><Reference refidx="69"/><Reference refidx="70"/>  </Para><Para id="_1284">One Finnish study recruited parents aged 40 years or older and known to carry an MMR mutation to complete a questionnaire that  investigated how parents shared knowledge of genetic risk with their adult and minor offspring. The study also identified challenges in the communication process.<Reference refidx="71"/> Of 248 parents, 87% reported that they had disclosed  results to their children. Reasons for nondisclosure were consistent with previous studies (young age of offspring, socially distant relationships, or feelings of difficulty in discussing the topic).<Reference refidx="68"/><Reference refidx="69"/><Reference refidx="72"/> Nearly all parents had informed their adult offspring about their genetic risk and the possibility of genetic testing, but nearly one-third were unsure of how their offspring had used the information. Parents identified discussing their children’s cancer risk as the most difficult aspect of the communication process. Of the 191 firstborn children informed, 69% had undergone genetic testing. One-third of the parents suggested that health professionals should be involved in disclosure of the information and that a family appointment at the genetics clinic should be made at the time of disclosure. </Para><Para id="_1285">In regard to informing second- and third-degree relatives, individuals may favor a cascade approach;  for example, it  is assumed that once a relative is given information about the family’s risk of LS, he or she would then be responsible for informing his or her first-degree relatives.<Reference refidx="67"/><Reference refidx="68"/><Reference refidx="69"/>  This cascade approach to communication is distinctly preferred in regard to informing relatives’ offspring, particularly those of minor age, and the consensus suggests that it would be inappropriate to disclose such information to a second-degree or third-degree relative without first proceeding through the family relational hierarchy.<Reference refidx="67"/><Reference refidx="68"/><Reference refidx="69"/><Reference refidx="72"/> In one study, persons who had undergone testing and were found to carry a LS-predisposing mutation were more likely than persons who had received true negative or uninformative results to inform at least one second-degree or third-degree relative about their genetic test results.<Reference refidx="70"/></Para><Para id="_708">While communication about genetic risk is generally viewed as an open process, some communication barriers were reported across studies.  Reasons for not informing a relative included lack of a close relationship and lack of contact with the individual; in fact, emotional, rather than relational, closeness seemed to be a more important determinant of the degree of risk communication.  A desire to not worry relatives with information about test results and  the perception that relatives would not understand the meaning of this information also have been cited as communication barriers.<Reference refidx="70"/>  Disclosure seemed less likely if at-risk individuals were considered too young to receive the information (i.e., children), if information about the hereditary cancer risk had previously created conflict in the family,<Reference refidx="69"/> or if it was assumed that relatives would be uninterested in information about testing.<Reference refidx="68"/>  Prior existence of conflict seemed to inhibit discussions about hereditary cancer risk, particularly if such discussions involved disclosure of bad news.<Reference refidx="69"/></Para><Para id="_709">For most participants in these studies, the news that the pattern of cancers in their families was attributable to a LS-predisposing mutation did not come as a surprise,<Reference refidx="67"/><Reference refidx="68"/> as individuals had suspected a hereditary cause for the familial cancers or had prior family discussions about cancer.  Identification of a LS-predisposing mutation in the family was considered a private matter but not necessarily a secret,<Reference refidx="67"/>  and many individuals had discussed the family’s mutation status with 
someone outside of the family.  Knowledge about the detection of a LS-predisposing mutation in the family was not viewed as stigmatizing, though individuals expressed concern about the potential impact of this information on insurance discrimination.<Reference refidx="67"/>  Also, while there may be a willingness to disclose information about the presence of a mutation in the family, one study suggests a tendency to remain more private about the disclosure of individual results, distinguishing personal results from familial risk information.<Reference refidx="72"/> In a few cases, individuals reported that their relatives expressed anger, shock, or other negative emotional reactions after receiving news about the family’s LS risk;<Reference refidx="69"/> however, most indicated little to no difficulty in informing their relatives.<Reference refidx="68"/>  It was suggested that families who are more comfortable and open with cancer-related discussions may be more receptive and accepting of news about genetic risk.<Reference refidx="69"/></Para><Para id="_710">In some cases, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460211">probands</GlossaryTermRef> reported feeling particularly obliged to inform family members about a hereditary cancer risk <Reference refidx="69"/> and were often the 
strongest advocates for encouraging their family members to undergo genetic counseling and testing for the family 
mutation.<Reference refidx="67"/>  Some gender and family role differences also emerged in regard to the dissemination of hereditary cancer risk information.  One study reported that female probands were more comfortable discussing genetic information than were male probands and that male probands showed a greater need for professional support during the family communication process.<Reference refidx="68"/>  Another study suggested that mothers may be particularly influential members of the family network in regard to communicating health risk information.<Reference refidx="73"/>  Mutation-negative individuals, persons who chose not to be tested, and spouses of at-risk persons reported not feeling as personally involved with the risk communication process compared with probands and other at-risk persons who had undergone genetic testing.<Reference refidx="67"/>  </Para><Para id="_711">Various modes of communication (e.g., in-person, telephone, or written contact) may typically be used to disclose genetic risk information within families.<Reference refidx="67"/> <Reference refidx="68"/><Reference refidx="69"/> In one study, communication aids such as a genetic counseling summary letter or LS booklet were viewed as helpful adjuncts to the communication process but were not considered central or necessary to its success.<Reference refidx="68"/> Studies have suggested that recommendations by health care providers to inform relatives about hereditary cancer risk may encourage communication about LS <Reference refidx="69"/> and that support by health care professionals may be helpful in overcoming barriers to communicating such information to family members.<Reference refidx="72"/></Para><Para id="_1411">Much of the literature to date on family communication  has focused on disclosure of test results; however, other elements of family communication are currently being explored. One study evaluated the role of older family members in providing various types of support (e.g., instrumental, emotional, crisis help, and dependability when needed) among individuals with LS and their family members (206 respondents from 33 families).<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="74"/> Respondents completed interviews about their family social network (biological and non-biological relatives and others outside the family) and patterns of communication within their family.  The average age of the respondents and the members of their family social network did not differ (age ~43 years).  The study found that 23% of the members of the family social network encouraged CRC screening (other types of support, such as social support, were reported much more frequently). Those who encouraged screening were older, female, and significant others or biological family members, rather than nonfamily members.  Given that many of the members of the family social network did not live in the same household, the study points out the importance of extended family in the context of screening encouragement and support.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="10207639" MedlineID="99224046">Codori AM, Petersen GM, Miglioretti DL, et al.: Attitudes toward colon cancer gene testing: factors predicting test uptake.

two FAP chemoprevention trials of ursodeoxycholate that were performed (cited Parc et 
al. and van Heumen et al. as references 173 and 174, respectively) as a result of preclinical 
data suggesting that ursodeoxycholate inhibits intestinal 
adenomas in mice that harbor an 
<GeneName>Apc</GeneName>
germline mutation 
(cited Jacoby et al. as reference 172). In both studies, 
ursodeoxycholate did not have a significant 
chemopreventive effect on duodenal polyps; in one 
study, ursodeoxycholate in
combination with celecoxib 
appeared to promote polyp density in patients with FAP.
</Para><Para id="_2796">Added <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_2776" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">text</SummaryRef> to state that the presence of pseudogenes  has, for a time, compromised evaluation of the <GeneName>PMS2</GeneName> gene. Techniques employed in characterizing variants of uncertain significance (VUS) have proven helpful in establishing the pathogenicity of sequence variants in <GeneName>PMS2</GeneName> (cited Borràs et al. as reference 359);  this is in keeping with the broader approach to classifying and reclassifying VUS, as undertaken by the International Mismatch Repair Consortium (cited Thompson et al. as reference 360).</Para><Para id="_2797">Added <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062863#_1077" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-genetics-pdq">text</SummaryRef> about a 
European consortium of clinic-based

risk of only 19% in men and 11% in women with 
<GeneName>PMS2</GeneName>

as reference 361). On the basis of these figures, this consortium made a clinical recommendation to delay the onset of colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer screening to age 30 years, in line with their recommendation for later initiation of screening for <GeneName>MSH6</GeneName> mutation carriers.

Also added text to 
state that CAPP3, which is evaluating the
effect of lower 
doses of aspirin, began in 2013 and is expected to enroll approximately 3,000 
mutation carriers by about 2021 (cited Burn et al. as reference 402).</Para><Para id="_disclaimerHP_3">This summary is written and maintained by the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cancer-genetics-board">PDQ Cancer Genetics Editorial Board</ExternalRef>, which is
