the midline often drain bilaterally.  Second station nodes include the parotid,
jugular, and the upper and lower posterior cervical nodes.

second primary tumor of the upper aerodigestive tract.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/>  A study has shown
that daily treatment of these patients with moderate doses of isotretinoin
(13-cis-retinoic acid) for 1 year can significantly reduce the incidence of
second tumors.  No survival advantage has yet been demonstrated, however, in
part due to recurrence and death from the primary malignancy.  
An additional trial has shown no benefit of retinyl palmitate or retinyl palmitate plus beta-carotene when compared to retinoic acid alone.<Reference refidx="12"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335129">Level of evidence: 1iiDii</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_9">The rate of curability of cancers of the lip and oral cavity varies depending
on the stage and specific site.  Most patients present with early cancers of
the lip, which are highly curable by surgery or by radiation therapy with cure
rates of 90% to 100%.  Small cancers of the retromolar trigone, hard palate,
and upper gingiva are highly curable by either radiation therapy or surgery
with survival rates of as much as 100%.  Local control rates of as much as 90% can be
achieved with either radiation therapy or surgery in small cancers of the
anterior tongue, the floor of the mouth, and buccal mucosa.<Reference refidx="13"/>
</Para><Para id="_10">Moderately advanced and advanced cancers of the lip also can be controlled
effectively by surgery or radiation therapy or a combination of these.  The
choice of treatment is generally dictated by the anticipated functional and

retromolar trigone without evidence of spread to cervical lymph nodes are
usually curable and have shown local control rates of as much as 90%; such lesions of the
hard palate, upper gingiva, and buccal mucosa have a local control rate of as much as 80%.  In the absence of clinical evidence of spread to cervical lymph nodes,
moderately advanced lesions of the floor of the mouth and anterior tongue are
generally curable with survival rates of as much as  70% and 65%, respectively.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/>

lymph nodes, some general considerations for the treatment of lip and oral cavity cancer include the following:<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/> 
</Para><ItemizedList id="_330" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Surgery
alone.</ListItem><ListItem>Radiation therapy alone.</ListItem><ListItem>A  combination of the above.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_55">For lesions of the oral cavity, surgery must adequately encompass all of the
gross as well as the presumed microscopic extent of the disease.  If regional
nodes are positive, cervical node dissection is usually done in continuity. 
With modern approaches, the surgeon can successfully ablate large posterior
oral cavity tumors and with reconstructive methods can achieve satisfactory
functional results.  Prosthodontic rehabilitation is important, particularly in
early-stage cancers, to assure the best quality of life.
</Para><Para id="_56">Radiation therapy for lip and oral cavity cancers can be administered by external-beam
radiation therapy (EBRT) or interstitial implantation alone, but for many sites the use of both
modalities produces better control and functional results.  Small superficial
cancers can be very successfully treated by local implantation using any one of
several radioactive sources, by intraoral cone radiation therapy, or by
electrons.  Larger lesions are frequently managed using EBRT to include the primary site and regional lymph nodes, even if they are
not clinically involved.  Supplementation with interstitial radiation sources
may be necessary to achieve adequate doses to large primary tumors and/or bulky
nodal metastases.  A review of published clinical results of radical radiation
therapy for head and neck cancer suggests a significant loss of local control
when the administration of radiation therapy was prolonged; therefore,
lengthening of standard treatment schedules should be avoided whenever
possible.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/>
</Para><Para id="_57">Early cancers (stage I and stage II) of the lip, floor of the mouth, and retromolar
trigone are highly curable by surgery or radiation therapy.  The choice of
treatment is dictated by the anticipated functional and cosmetic results. Availability of the particular expertise required of the surgeon or
radiation oncologist for the individual patient is also a factor in treatment choice.  </Para><Para id="_333">Advanced cancers (stage III
and stage IV) of the lip, floor of the mouth, and retromolar trigone represent a wide
spectrum of challenges for the surgeon and radiation oncologists.  Most patients with stage III or stage IV tumors are candidates for treatment by a
combination of surgery and radiation therapy. Patients with small T3 lesions and no regional lymph nodes, and no distant
metastases or patients who have no lymph nodes larger than 2 cm in diameter, for whom
treatment by radiation therapy alone or surgery alone might be appropriate,
are the exceptions.  Because local
recurrence and/or distant metastases are common in this group of patients, they
should be considered for clinical trials that are evaluating the following:  </Para><ItemizedList id="_334" Style="bullet"><ListItem>The
potential role of radiation modifiers to improve local control or decrease
morbidity.</ListItem><ListItem>The role of combinations of chemotherapy with surgery and/or radiation
therapy both to improve local control and to decrease the frequency of distant
metastases.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_58">Early cancers of the buccal mucosa are equally curable by radiation therapy or
by adequate excision.  Patient factors and local expertise influence the choice
of treatment.  Larger cancers require composite resection with reconstruction
of the defect by pedicle flaps.
</Para><Para id="_59">Early lesions (T1 and T2) of the anterior tongue may be managed by surgery or
by radiation therapy alone.  Both modalities produce 70% to 85% cure rates in
early lesions.  Moderate excisions of tongue, even hemiglossectomy, can often
result in little speech disability provided the wound closure is
such that the tongue is not bound down.  If, however, the resection is more
extensive, problems may include aspiration of liquids and solids and difficulty
in swallowing in addition to speech difficulties.  Occasionally, patients with
tumor of the tongue require almost total glossectomy.  Large lesions generally
require combined surgical and radiation treatment.  The control rates for
larger lesions are about 30% to 40%.  According to clinical and radiological
evidence of involvement, cancers of the lower gingiva that are exophytic and
amenable to adequate local excision may be excised to include portions of bone. 
More advanced lesions require segmental bone resection, hemimandibulectomy, or
maxillectomy, depending on the extent of the lesion and its location.
</Para><Para id="_60">Early lesions of the upper gingiva or hard palate without bone involvement can
be treated with equal effectiveness by surgery or by radiation therapy alone. 
Advanced infiltrative and ulcerating lesions should be treated by a combination
of radiation therapy and surgery.  Most primary cancers of the hard palate are
of minor salivary gland origin.  Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the hard
palate is uncommon, and these tumors generally represent invasion of squamous
cell carcinoma arising on the upper gingiva, which is much more common.  Management of squamous cell carcinoma of the upper gingiva and hard palate are
usually considered together.  Surgical treatment of cancer of the hard palate
usually requires excision of underlying bone producing an opening into the
antrum.  This defect can be filled and covered with a dental prosthesis, which is a
maneuver that restores satisfactory swallowing and speech.
</Para><Para id="_61">Patients who smoke while on radiation therapy appear to have lower response
rates and shorter survival durations than those who do not;<Reference refidx="8"/> therefore,
patients should be counseled to stop smoking before beginning radiation
therapy.  Dental status evaluation should be performed prior to therapy to
prevent late sequelae.
