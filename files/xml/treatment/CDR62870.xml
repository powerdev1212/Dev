to normal cells.  The mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract, including
the oral mucosa, is a prime target for treatment-related toxicity by virtue of
its rapid rate of  cell turnover.  The oral cavity is highly susceptible to direct
and indirect toxic effects of cancer chemotherapy and ionizing radiation.<Reference refidx="1"/> This risk results from multiple factors, including high rates of cellular turnover for
the lining mucosa, a diverse and complex microflora, and trauma to oral tissues
during normal oral function.<Reference refidx="2"/> Although changes in soft tissue structures
within the oral cavity presumably reflect the changes that occur throughout the
gastrointestinal tract, this summary focuses on oral complications of
antineoplastic drugs and radiation therapies.
</Para><Para id="_458">It is essential that a multidisciplinary approach be used for oral management of the cancer patient before, during, and after cancer treatment.  A multidisciplinary approach is warranted because the medical complexity of these patients affects dental treatment planning, prioritization, and timing of dental care.  In addition, selected cancer patients (e.g., status posttreatment with high-dose head-and-neck radiation) are often at lifelong risk for serious complications such as osteoradionecrosis of the mandible.   Thus, a multidisciplinary oncology team that includes oncologists, oncology nurses, and dental generalists and specialists as well as dental hygienists, social workers, dieticians, and related health professionals can often achieve highly effective preventive and therapeutic outcomes relative to oral complications in these patients.</Para><Para id="_3">While oral complications may mimic selected systemic disorders, unique oral
toxicities emerge in the context of specific oral anatomic structures and their

infection, salivary gland dysfunction, taste dysfunction, and pain.  These
complications can lead to secondary complications such as dehydration,
dysgeusia, and malnutrition.  In myelosuppressed cancer patients, the oral
cavity can also be a source of systemic infection.  Radiation of the head and
neck can irreversibly injure oral mucosa, vasculature, muscle, and bone,  resulting in xerostomia, rampant dental caries, trismus, soft tissue necrosis,
and osteonecrosis. 
</Para><Para id="_9">Severe oral toxicities can compromise delivery of optimal cancer therapy
protocols.  For example, dose reduction or treatment schedule modifications may
be necessary to allow for resolution of oral lesions.  In cases of severe oral
morbidity, the patient may no longer be able to continue cancer therapy;
treatment is then usually discontinued.  These disruptions in dosing caused by
oral complications can  directly affect patient survivorship. 
</Para><Para id="_10">Management of oral complications of cancer therapy includes identification of
high-risk populations, patient education, initiation of pretreatment
interventions, and timely management of lesions.  Assessment of oral status and
stabilization of oral disease before cancer therapy are critical to overall
patient care.  Care should be both preventive and therapeutic to minimize risk for oral and associated systemic complications.

New technologies could also provide a setting in which novel classes of
chemotherapeutic drugs, used at increased doses, could lead to enhanced
cancer cure rates and durability of disease remission.</Para><Para id="_839">As has been <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062870#_458" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/mouth-throat/oral-complications-hp-pdq">noted</SummaryRef>, it is essential that a multidisciplinary approach be used for oral management of the cancer patient before, during, and after cancer treatment.  This collaboration is pivotally important for the advancement of basic, clinical, and translational research associated with oral complications of current and emerging cancer therapies.

from complex interactions among multiple factors.   The most prominent
contributors are direct lethal and sublethal damage to oral tissues,
attenuation of immune and other protective systems, and interference with
normal healing.  Principal causes can  be attributed to both direct
stomatotoxicity and indirect stomatotoxicity.  Direct toxicities are
initiated via primary injury to oral tissues.  Indirect toxicities are caused by nonoral
toxicities that secondarily affect the oral cavity, including the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_840" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Myelosuppression.</ListItem><ListItem>Loss of tissue-based immune cells.</ListItem><ListItem>Loss of protective salivary
constituents.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_15">Understanding of mechanisms associated with oral complications continues to
increase.  Unfortunately, there are no universally effective agents
or protocols to prevent toxicity.  Elimination of preexisting
dental/periapical, periodontal, and mucosal infections; institution of
comprehensive oral hygiene protocols during therapy; and reduction of other
factors that may compromise oral mucosal integrity (e.g., physical trauma to
oral tissues) can reduce frequency and severity of oral complications
in cancer patients (refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062870#_28" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/mouth-throat/oral-complications-hp-pdq">Oral and Dental Management Before Cancer Therapy</SummaryRef> and the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062870#_61" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/mouth-throat/oral-complications-hp-pdq">Oral and Dental Management After Cancer Therapy</SummaryRef> sections of this summary for further information).<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_16">Complications can be acute (developing during therapy) or chronic (developing
months to years after therapy).  In general, cancer chemotherapy causes acute
toxicities that resolve following discontinuation of therapy and recovery of
damaged tissues.  In contrast, radiation protocols typically cause not only
acute oral toxicities, but induce permanent tissue damage that result in
lifelong risk for the patient.
</Para><SummarySection id="_17"><Title>Chemotherapy-induced Complications</Title><Para id="_18">Risk factors for oral complications (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062870#_335" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/mouth-throat/oral-complications-hp-pdq">Table 2</SummaryRef>) derive from both direct damage to oral
tissues secondary to chemotherapy and indirect damage due to
regional or systemic toxicity.  For example, therapy-related toxicity
to oral mucosa can be exacerbated by colonizing oral microflora when local and
systemic immune function is concurrently compromised.  Frequency and severity
of oral complications are directly related to extent and type of systemic
compromise.

chemotherapy.  In approximately 50% of these patients, the lesions are severe
and require medical intervention including modification of their cytotoxic
cancer therapy.  Normal oral mucosal epithelium is estimated to undergo
complete replacement every 9 to 16 days.  Intensive chemotherapy can cause
ulcerative mucositis that initially emerges approximately 2 weeks after
initiation of high-dose chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_694">Chemotherapy
directly impairs replication of basal epithelial cells; other factors,
including proinflammatory cytokines and metabolic products of bacteria, may also
play a role.  The labial mucosa, buccal mucosa, tongue, floor of mouth, and soft
palate are more severely affected by chemotherapy than are the attached, heavily
keratinized tissues such as the hard palate and gingiva; this may be caused by relative rate of epithelial cell turnover among high-risk versus low-risk oral mucosal tissues.  Topical cryotherapy may ameliorate
mucositis caused by agents such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) by reducing vascular
delivery of these toxic agents to replicating oral epithelium.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_754">It is
difficult to predict whether a patient will develop mucositis strictly on the

dentition/periapices, and periodontium.  Prevalence of these infections has
been substantiated in multiple studies.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/>  Specific criteria for determining
risk of infectious flare during myelosuppression have not been developed. 
Guidelines for assessment primarily address both degree of severity of the chronic
lesion and whether acute symptoms have recently (i.e., &lt;90 days) developed. However, chronic asymptomatic periodontitis may also represent a focus for systemic infectious complications since bacteria, bacterial cell wall substances, and inflammatory cytokines may translocate into the circulation via ulcerated pocket epithelium.<Reference refidx="10"/> In addition, poor oral hygiene and periodontitis seem to increase the prevalence of pulmonary infections in high-risk patients.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_796">Resolution of
oral toxicity, including mucositis and infection, generally coincides with

damage also differs from chemotherapy-induced changes in that irradiated tissue

</Para><Para id="_46">Oral complications are related to current systemic and oral health, oral
manifestations of underlying disease, and oral complications of recent cancer
or other medical therapy.  
During this period, oral trauma and clinically significant infections, including
dental caries, periodontal disease, and pulpal infection, should be eliminated.
Additionally, patients should be educated relative to the range and management
of oral complications that may occur during subsequent phases.  Baseline oral
hygiene instructions should be provided. It is especially important to note whether patients have been treated with bisphosphonates (e.g., patients with multiple myeloma) and to plan their care accordingly.</Para><Para id="_48"><Strong>Phase II: Neutropenic Phase
</Strong></Para><Para id="_49">Oral complications arise primarily from direct and indirect stomatotoxicities
associated with high-dose chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy and their sequelae.
Mucositis, xerostomia, and those lesions related to myelosuppression,
thrombocytopenia, and anemia predominate.  This phase is typically the period
of high prevalence and severity of oral complications.  
</Para><Para id="_51">Oral mucositis usually begins 7 to 10 days after initiation of cytotoxic
therapy and remains present for approximately 2 weeks after cessation of
that therapy.  Viral, fungal, and bacterial infections may arise, with
incidence dependent on the use of prophylactic regimens, oral status prior to
chemotherapy, and duration/severity of neutropenia.  Frequency of infection
declines upon resolution of mucositis and regeneration of neutrophils. This phenomenon appears to be more a temporal relation than a causative one, based on the predominant evidence.  Despite the initial marrow recovery, however, the
patient may remain at risk for infection, depending on status of overall immune
reconstitution.
</Para><Para id="_52">Salivary gland hypofunction/xerostomia secondary to anticholinergic drugs and taste dysfunction is
initially detected in this phase; the toxicity typically resolves within 2 to 3
months. 
</Para><Para id="_463">In allogeneic transplant patients, while uncommon, hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) can occur and can result in significant oral mucosal inflammation and breakdown that can complicate the oral course for patients.  Clinical presentation will often not be sufficiently distinct to diagnosis this lesion.  The clinical assessment is typically based on the patient experiencing more-severe-than-expected mucositis that will often not heal within the time line for mucosal recovery associated with oral mucositis caused by chemotherapy.</Para><Para id="_53"><Strong>Phase III: Hematopoietic Recovery</Strong>
</Para><Para id="_54">Frequency and severity of acute oral complications typically begin to decrease
approximately 3 to 4 weeks after cessation of chemotherapy.  Healing of
ulcerative oral mucositis in the setting of marrow regeneration contributes to
this dynamic.  Although immune reconstitution is developing, oral mucosal
immune defenses may not be optimal.  Generally stated, immune reconstitution will take between 6 and 9 months for autologous transplant patients and between 9 and 12 months for allogeneic transplant patients not developing chronic GVHD. Thus, the patient remains at risk for
selected infection, including candidal and herpes simplex virus infections.</Para><Para id="_799">Mucosal bacterial infections during this phase occur less
frequently unless engraftment is delayed or the patient has acute GVHD or is
receiving GVHD therapy. Most centers will use systemic infection prophylaxis throughout this period (and, in many instances, longer) to reduce the risk of infections in general, a practice that positively influences the rate and severity of both systemic and local oral infections.</Para><Para id="_55">The hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient represents a unique cohort at this point.  For example, risk
for acute oral GVHD typically emerges during this time in allogeneic graft
recipients.  
</Para><Para id="_56"><Strong>Phase IV: Immune Reconstitution/Recovery from Systemic Toxicity
</Strong></Para><Para id="_57">Oral lesions are principally related to chronic conditioning regimen–associated (chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy) toxicity and, in the allogeneic patient, GVHD.  Late viral infections and xerostomia
predominate.  Mucosal bacterial infections are infrequent unless the patient
remains neutropenic or has severe chronic GVHD.</Para><Para id="_841">Risk exists for graft failure, cancer relapse, and
second malignancies.  The hematopoietic stem cell transplant patient may develop oral manifestations of
chronic GVHD during this period.</Para><Para id="_58"><Strong>Phase V: Long-term Survival</Strong>
</Para><Para id="_59">Long-term survivors of cancer treated with high-dose chemotherapy alone or
chemoradiotherapy will generally have few significant permanent oral
complications.  
</Para><Para id="_60">Risk for radiation-induced chronic complications is related to the total dose
and schedule of radiation therapy.  Regimens that incorporate total body irradiation may result in permanent salivary gland hypofunction/xerostomia,<Reference refidx="8"/> which is the most frequently reported late
oral complication.  Permanent salivary gland dysfunction can occur in autologous transplant patients in addition to nonautologous recipients.  Other significant complications
include craniofacial growth and developmental abnormalities in pediatric
patients, and emergence of second malignancies of the head/neck region.

nonmedicated approaches to baseline oral care, given limited published
evidence. 
Most nonmedicated oral care protocols use topical, frequent (every 4–6 hours)
rinsing with 0.9% saline.  Additional interventions include dental brushing
with toothpaste, dental flossing, ice chips, and sodium bicarbonate rinses. 
Patient compliance with these agents can be maximized by comprehensive
overseeing by the health care professional.</Para><Para id="_68">Patients using removable dental prostheses or orthodontic appliances have
risk of mucosal injury or infection.  This risk can be eliminated or substantially reduced prior to high-dose cancer therapy. (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062870#_244" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/mouth-throat/oral-complications-hp-pdq">list</SummaryRef> of Guidelines for Management of Dentures and Orthodontic Appliances in Patients Receiving High-Dose Cancer Therapy.)</Para><Para id="_71">Dental brushing and flossing represent simple, cost-effective approaches to
bacterial dental plaque control.  This strategy is designed to reduce risk of
oral soft tissue infection during myeloablation.  Oncology
teams at some centers promote their use, while teams at other centers have
patients discontinue brushing and flossing when peripheral blood components
decrease below defined thresholds (e.g., platelets &lt;30,000/mm<Superscript>3</Superscript>). There is no comprehensive evidence base regarding the optimal approach.  Many centers adopt the strategy that the benefits of properly performed dental brushing and flossing in reducing risk of gingival infection outweigh the risks. 
</Para><Para id="_72">Periodontal infection (gingivitis and periodontitis) increases risk for oral
bleeding; healthy tissues should not bleed.  Discontinuing dental brushing and
flossing can increase risk for gingival bleeding, oral infection, and
bacteremia.  Risk for gingival bleeding and infection, therefore, is reduced by
eliminating gingival infection before therapy and promoting oral health daily
by removing bacterial plaque with gentle debridement with a soft or ultra-soft
toothbrush during therapy.  Mechanical plaque control not only promotes
gingival health, but it also may decrease risk of exacerbation of oral mucositis
secondary to microbial colonization of damaged mucosal surfaces.</Para><Para id="_73">Dental brushing and flossing should be performed 
daily under the supervision of   professional staff:
</Para><ItemizedList id="_755" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>A soft
nylon-bristled toothbrush should be used 2 to 3 times a day with techniques that specifically
maintain the gingival portion of the tooth and periodontal sulcus, keeping them
free of bacterial plaque.</ListItem><ListItem>Rinsing the toothbrush in hot water every 15 to 30
seconds during brushing will soften the brush and reduce risk for trauma.</ListItem><ListItem>Oral
rinsing with water or saline 3 to 4 times while brushing will further aid in
removal of dental plaque dislodged by brushing.</ListItem><ListItem>Rinses containing alcohol
should be avoided.</ListItem><ListItem>A toothpaste with a relatively neutral taste should be considered because the flavoring agents in toothpaste can irritate oral
soft tissues.</ListItem><ListItem>Brushes should be air-dried between uses.</ListItem><ListItem>While disinfectants have been
suggested, their routine use to clean brushes has not been proven of value.</ListItem><ListItem>Ultrasonic toothbrushes may be substituted for manual brushes if patients are
properly trained in their use.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_74">Patients skilled at flossing without traumatizing gingival tissues may continue
flossing throughout chemotherapy administration.  Flossing allows for
interproximal removal of dental bacterial plaque and thus promotes gingival
health.  As with dental brushing, this intervention should be performed under the supervision of professional staff to ensure its safe administration.
</Para><Para id="_75">The oral cavity should be cleaned after meals:</Para><ItemizedList id="_756" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>If xerostomia is present,
plaque and food debris may accumulate secondary to reduced salivary function,

oral tissues; mechanical plaque removal is often necessary.  </ListItem><ListItem>Care must be
exerted in the use of the varied mechanical hygiene aids that are
available; dental floss, interproximal brushes, and wooden wedges
can injure oral tissues rendered fragile by chemotherapy.  </ListItem><ListItem>Toothettes have
limited ability to cleanse the dentition; however, they may be useful for
cleaning maxillary/mandibular alveolar ridges of edentulous areas, palate, and
tongue.
</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_76">Preventing dryness of the lips  to reduce risk for
tissue injury is important.  Mouth breathing and/or xerostomia secondary to anticholinergic
medications used for nausea management can induce the condition. GVHD of the lips can also contribute to dry lips in allogeneic transplant patients.  Lip care
products containing petroleum-based oils and waxes can be useful. 
Lanolin-based creams and ointments may be more effective in
moisturizing/lubricating the lips and thus protecting against trauma.

Cancer pain may be caused by local and distant tumor effects. Direct invasion by cancer may cause pain and may result from inflammatory and neuropathic mechanisms. Effective prevention and management of pain in cancer requires knowledge of the factors and mechanisms involved.  </Para><Para id="_761">It is estimated that 45% to 80% of all cancer patients have inadequate pain management. Seventy-five percent to 90% of patients with terminal or advanced cancer may have pain. Pain may be present in up to 85% of patients with head and neck cancers (HNCs) at diagnosis.</Para><Para id="_815">Orofacial pain associated with cancer management is a well-recognized adverse effect of treatment. Pain due to oral mucositis is the most frequently reported patient-related complaint during cancer therapy.  Severe and painful mucositis is associated with additional hospital admissions and prolonged periods in hospital, leading to delayed, interrupted, or altered cancer therapy protocols that may affect prognosis, QOL, and cost of care. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a common complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), occurring in 25% to 70% of patients; oral lesions are often painful.</Para><Para id="_469">In addition to HNCs, oral manifestations of leukemia and lymphoma may cause pain and loss of function.  Lymphomas and leukemias may induce pain by infiltration of pain-sensitive structures and if secondary oral infection occurs. Multiple myeloma frequently presents with pain and, when associated with teeth, presents a diagnostic challenge.  Intracranial malignancies may give rise to orofacial pain and headache.  Even in diagnosed cancer patients, the prediction of intracranial metastases with new or changed headache is difficult.</Para><Para id="_751">Pain may present similarly to classical trigeminal neuralgia. Jaw pain may be caused by metastatic cancer, and tumors arising from the breast, prostate, thyroid, lung, and kidney have a propensity to spread to bone in the head and neck, most commonly seen in the posterior mandible. Metastasis in the oral region may be the first indication of a distant undiscovered malignancy in up to 60% of patients.  Patients with nasopharyngeal cancer report pain that may be referred to the temporomandibular joint  region and masquerade as temporomandibular disorder. Orofacial pain has been reported in patients with a distant nonmetastasized cancer, most commonly in the lungs.</Para><Para id="_470">The mechanism of pain is thought to be involvement of the  vagus or phrenic nerve. Paraneoplastic processes may present with peripheral neuropathies, particularly in patients with lung cancer and lymphoma. Neuropathies are commonly  reported in patients with malignancy (1.7%–5.5%) because of the direct effects of the tumor, paraneoplastic syndromes, and treatment-related toxicities.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_471"><Title> Orofacial Pain due to Cancer Management</Title><Para id="_472">The most common acute oral side effect of radiation therapy and/or cancer chemotherapy is oral mucositis. Oral mucositis and associated pain are the most distressing symptoms reported by patients receiving head and neck radiation therapy and aggressive neutropenia-inducing chemotherapy regimens. Combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy results in increased frequency, severity, and duration of mucositis.

Mucosal pain may persist long after the mucositis resolves. Reports of mucosal sensitivity at 1-year follow-up are common, suggesting that chronic symptoms may be related to tissue change, including epithelial atrophy and/or neuropathy.</Para><Para id="_474">Orofacial pain after HNC therapy can be caused by musculoskeletal syndromes, including temporomandibular disorders associated with muscular fibrosis, scar formation, and discontinuity of the jaw. Ablative surgery may lead to tissue defects that may cause significant loss of orofacial function. Resection of the maxilla and mandible leads to sensory impairment, and more than half of patients experience regional hyperalgesia or allodynia. Pain scores after surgery for HNCs are highest for oral cavity cancers, followed by cancers of the larynx and oropharynx.</Para><Para id="_475"> At more than 6 months postsurgery, impairment due to moderate to severe pain may be seen in approximately one-third of patients. Analgesics and physiotherapy are commonly used in pain management in these patients. Long-term HNC survivors (&gt;3 years) continue to suffer from more pain and functional problems. Surgery-related pain involves inflammatory and neuropathic pain mechanisms.</Para><Para id="_476">Postradiation osteonecrosis and bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis are recognized oral complications that may cause pain; clinical presentation may include pain, swelling, and bone exposure. Oral GVHD represents a local manifestation of a systemic disease post-HCT that may result in mucosal and arthritic pain. Viral reactivation of herpes viruses may cause pain. Postherpetic neuralgia may result in chronic pain causing painful dysesthesias in the affected area that may persist for years. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_477"><Title>Treatment of Pain in Cancer Patients</Title><Para id="_478">Pain management should be directed at the diagnoses of etiologic factors, pain mechanisms involved, and pain severity.

Comorbid oral conditions such as mucositis or graft-versus-host disease can dramatically increase the severity of oral lesions and significantly increase the difficulty of diagnosis.</Para><Para id="_820">  In most instances, herpes simplex
virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)
infections result from reactivation of latent virus, while cytomegalovirus
(CMV) infections can result from either reactivation of a latent virus, or via a
newly acquired virus.  The viral infections can cause oral mucosal lesions. The prevalence of HSV infection was found to be higher when oral ulcers existed than when no oral ulcers were present.<Reference refidx="25"/></Para><Para id="_497">A systematic review was conducted by the Mucositis Study Group (MSG) of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer/International Society of Oral Oncology.<Reference refidx="25"/> One of the aims of this review was to evaluate studies conducted since 1989 that considered the prevalence of oral viral infections. The reported prevalence of oral HSV infection was 49.8% (95% CI, 31.3–68.2%) among neutropenic cancer patients. The prevalence was much lower in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients who were treated with radiation therapy (0%); however, it rose to 43.2% (95% CI,  0–100%) in irradiated HNC patients who were treated with radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy. This finding is not surprising because neutropenic patients—mainly patients with hematological malignancies—develop deeper immunosuppression during cancer treatment than do other groups of cancer patients. However, the addition of chemotherapy to the conventional radiation therapy increased risks for HNC patients.</Para><Para id="_498">With the recognition of the increased risk of HSV and VZV reactivation in seropositive patients who are expected to become profoundly immunosuppressed during cancer therapy, prophylaxis with antiviral medications has drastically reduced the incidence of disease, primarily in patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy and undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). 
  The MSG systematic review identified a series of randomized controlled trials testing various antiviral prophylactic protocols.<Reference refidx="25"/> It concluded that there was a significant benefit to using acyclovir to prevent HSV oral infection (at 800 mg/d).<Reference refidx="26"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] In addition, the systematic review pointed out that HSV reactivation was reported in a similar prevalence whether acyclovir or valacyclovir was prescribed <Reference refidx="27"/> and that the prevention of HSV reactivation was achieved in various dosing protocols of valacyclovir (500 or 1,000 mg/d).<Reference refidx="27"/></Para><Para id="_499">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT) have published guidelines for the prevention of opportunistic infections in HSCT recipients, which have become a benchmark in this field.<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/> This significant body of literature presents a global perspective on the prevention of viral infections. CDC, IDSA, and ASBMT concluded that acyclovir prophylaxis is recommended for all HSV seropositive allograft recipients. Valacyclovir  instead of acyclovir has been ranked moderately as an effective prevention for HSV in HSCT; foscarnet was mentioned as a drug to avoid for routine HSV prophylaxis because of substantial renal toxicity.</Para><Para id="_821">These guidelines extend beyond the MSG systematic review, which failed to provide sufficient evidence (e.g., regarding CMV, VZV, and EBV infections) because the evidence available is not specific for infections with oral involvement.

Unfortunately, the available literature <Reference refidx="25"/> and the CDC and ASBMT guidelines <Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/> do not refer to treatment recommendations once a viral infection is diagnosed. As with
other infections, risk of systemic dissemination and morbidity/mortality
increases with degree and duration of immunocompromisation.  The infections can be
fatal, depending on degree of immunosuppression.</Para><SummarySection id="_264"><Title>Herpes simplex virus
</Title><Para id="_121">Oral herpetic lesions can range from routine herpes labialis to severe stomatitis causing large, painful ulcerations throughout the mouth.  The severity of lesions dramatically increases with  increasing degrees of immunosuppression.  The incidence of recurrent oral HSV lesions in myelosuppressed cancer patients has
been considerably reduced with the use of prophylactic acyclovir and valacyclovir regimens.<Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/> Additionally, the severity and duration of actual HSV lesions have been reduced by antiviral therapies.</Para><Para id="_822">Breakthrough infections are uncommon but can occur.  While
true resistance to antivirals occurs, clinical infection in the face of antiviral therapy is more likely caused by insufficient dosing or compromised gastrointestinal absorption of oral
acyclovir.  The introduction of valacyclovir appears to have reduced the incidence of breakthrough oral HSV infections. Topical therapy alone is generally not efficacious in the
immunocompromised patient.</Para><Para id="_122">In patients who are not receiving antiviral prophylaxis, oral lesions typically emerge concurrent with chemotherapy or chemoradiation therapy during the period of most significant immunosuppression (white blood cell nadir).  Typically, in HSCT patients, this represents the period  a few days pretransplant through day 35 posttransplant.  The risk of HSV reactivation remains higher than normal until immune reconstitution occurs.  Similar patterns of risk are noted in patients who are receiving high-dose (immunosuppressive) chemotherapy.</Para><Para id="_823">Recurrent oral HSV infections occurring simultaneously with cancer therapy–induced oral mucositis can result in the development of extensive, confluent mucosal ulcerations clinically similar to primary herpetic stomatitis.    As such, HSV stomatitis can be
confused with cancer therapy–induced ulcerative mucositis.  Viral cultures from lesions in HSV seropositive patients are
essential for accurate diagnoses.  Assays that produce more rapid results,
including direct immunofluorescence, shell vial testing, and specific immunoassay for HSV antigen and/or biopsy, may also be useful.</Para><Para id="_501">Unlike in myelosuppressed cancer patients, incidence of HSV reactivation in patients undergoing head and neck radiation  is very low.<Reference refidx="25"/>  Therefore, HSV prophylaxis in patients scheduled to receive head and neck radiation is not recommended.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_265"><Title>Varicella-zoster virus

In patients who are receiving high-dose chemotherapy, orofacial VZV lesions are typically observed several weeks after cessation of chemotherapy—unlike HSV, which often occurs within 2 to 3 weeks after chemotherapy is discontinued.  For reasons that are not entirely clear, the period of increased risk of VZV reactivation essentially extends from  approximately 3 to 12 months posttransplant, with allogeneic transplant recipients being at  highest risk.  Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are the
primary drugs used for treatment.<Reference refidx="35"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_266"><Title>Cytomegalovirus</Title><Para id="_126">Oral lesions associated with CMV have been documented in immunocompromised patients, including those who have undergone marrow transplantation.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_502">Appearance is not pathognomonic and is characterized by multiple mild to moderate

because of viral propensity for infecting endothelial cells and fibroblasts, with

The lesion does not appear to be clinically significant in chemotherapy
recipients, however.  In contrast, HSCT patients who are immunocompromised for a
prolonged period may be at risk of developing EBV-related lymphomas of the
head and neck region, especially when T-cell–depleted grafts are used for allogeneic
transplant.  As such, risk of EBV infection typically emerges months after

This is generally poor advice unless there are extenuating circumstances. Healthy gingival tissues do not bleed unless traumatized.  Discontinuation of routine oral hygiene can increase the risk of infection that could not only promote bleeding but also increase the risk of local and systemic infection due to accumulation of bacterial plaque, leading to periodontal infections and tissue breakdown.

</Title><Para id="_136">Selected classes of chemotherapy, including the vinca alkaloids, vincristine,
and vinblastine, can cause direct neurotoxicity.  Additionally, drugs such as thalidomide and lenalidomide are associated with peripheral neuropathies that can affect the face and jaw. Deep-seated, throbbing
mandibular pain can occur.  Because this symptom is also consistent with acute
dental pulpal disease, it is important that a thorough history and oral
physical examination be performed when oral pain is present; radiographs and
vitality testing of the dental pulp are typically necessary.  After neurotoxicity is
appropriately diagnosed, management includes pain support and
patient counseling.  The symptom generally resolves within a week
of discontinuing the causative chemotherapy.
</Para><Para id="_137">Dental hypersensitivity may occasionally arise in patients weeks or months
after they discontinue chemotherapy.  Additionally, it has been observed that patients being treated with cyclosporine for treatment of graft-versus-host disease  will report increased thermal sensitivity.  The mechanisms of this response are not known.  Fortunately, thermal stimuli are self-resolving after discontinuation or withdrawal of therapy, though they can persist for several months.  Topical
application of fluorides and/or desensitizing toothpaste may ameliorate the
discomfort.
</Para><Para id="_138"> Patients may experience temporomandibular dysfunction pain involving muscles of mastication, temporomandibular joints, or teeth.  This condition is not unique to cancer patients, and
it correlates with stress and dysfunctional habits including bruxism and clenching
of the jaws.  Stress and sleep dysfunction appear to be the most frequent etiologic factors. Judicious use of muscle relaxants or anxiety-reducing agents plus
physical therapy (moist heat applications, massage, and gentle stretching) are
standard approaches for management.  For patients with a propensity for
clenching or bruxism during sleep, customized occlusal splints for use while
sleeping may be of value.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_271"><Title>Graft-versus-Host Disease</Title><Para id="_140">Patients who have received allogeneic or matched unrelated transplants are at
risk of developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> A related condition referred to as pseudo-GVHD is occasionally reported in autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.  GVHD can affect oral tissues and often mimics
naturally occurring autoimmune diseases such as erosive lichen planus, pemphigus, scleroderma, and Sjögren syndrome.
Oral GVHD has also been linked to oral precancerous and malignant lesions.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_141">Acute GVHD can occur as early as 2 to 3 weeks posttransplant; mucosal erythema
and erosion/ulceration are typical manifestations.  Chronic oral GVHD changes can be recognized as early as day 70 posttransplant.<Reference refidx="4"/>   The pattern and types of lesions seen in acute GVHD are also seen in chronic GVHD, but manifestations can also include raised white hyperkeratotic plaques and striae and persistent reduced salivary function.  Oral symptoms of oral GVHD include xerostomia and increased sensitivity and pain with spices, alcohols, and flavoring agents (especially mint flavors in toothpaste and oral care products). Patients may also suffer from odynophagia and dysphagia due to gastrointestinal involvement.<Reference refidx="5"/> All of these symptoms of GVHD may lead to weight loss and malnutrition.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_142">Biopsy of oral mucosa, including both surface epithelium and minor labial salivary glands, may be of value in
establishing a final diagnosis.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/>  Presence of a lymphocytic infiltrate (grade I)
with epithelial cell necrosis (grade II) provides the diagnostic basis for oral
GVHD.
As clinical criteria for recognition of oral signs and symptoms of GVHD have become more established,    dependance on the oral biopsy to diagnose oral involvement has lessened.  In cases of equivocal  examination findings, the biopsy can improve the recognition of oral involvement.</Para><Para id="_143">Topical management of mucosal lesions may include steroids, azathioprine, and/or oral psoralen
and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy (refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062870#_272" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/mouth-throat/oral-complications-hp-pdq">list</SummaryRef> on Management of Oral GVHD).<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="9"/>   While topical cyclosporin has been suggested as therapeutically beneficial, its effectiveness is less predictable than that of other treatments—which, when coupled with increased cost of care, usually decreases its utility.  The use of FK506 and mycophenolate mofetil to topically treat oral GVHD remains anecdotal and of uncertain efficacy.  Systemic therapy (e.g., prednisone, budesonide, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and other immunosuppressive agents)  is routinely
necessary, primarily to treat the condition.  Topical treatment can be used to specifically manage oral sensitivity and help heal ulcerations.  Patients with clinically
significant xerostomia may benefit from pilocarpine (5 mg 3 or 4 times a day) or cevimeline (10 mg 4 times a day) if native
salivary gland function remains partially intact.</Para><Para id="_503">Submucosal and/or dermal fibrosis can occur in persistent cases of chronic GVHD.  This scleroderma-like complication can be subtle and appear as slight mucosal or skin tightness, or it can progress to skin thickening and fibrosis.  Intraoral submucosal fibrotic bands have been noted to significantly restrict the oral opening.  Successful management of GVHD with systemic therapy will usually see resolution and/or significant resolution of this problem.  However, in rare instances, surgical or chemical techniques to disrupt fibrotic bands can be required to improve the oral opening.</Para><ItemizedList id="_272" Style="bullet" Compact="No"> <ListTitle>Management of Oral GVHD</ListTitle><ListItem>Topical steroids:<ItemizedList id="_273" Style="dash"><ListItem>Rinses: dexamethasone elixir (Decadron 0.1 mg/mL).

not resume routine dental treatment, including dental scaling and polishing,
until adequate immunologic reconstitution has occurred; this includes recovery
from graft-versus-host disease.

lymphoma.

As of October 2010, ONJ resolved in 36% of patients (29.7% for zoledronic acid and 40.4% for denosumab).  A combined analysis of these trials found that ONJ was an infrequent event, management was mostly conservative, and healing occurred in more than  one-third of the patients.  Bone-targeted therapy may help reduce the rate of ONJ and improve outcomes.<Reference refidx="17"/></Para><Para id="_875">When denosumab was compared to placebo in a study of men with nonmetastatic, high-risk, castration-resistant prostate cancer in which patients received treatment for at least 24 months, ONJ incidence was 4.6% in patients treated with denosumab; there were no cases of ONJ in the placebo group.<Reference refidx="18"/> Therefore, time on medication can be a factor in the development of ONJ.</Para><Para id="_731">Risk factors for ONJ include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_732" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Dental extractions.<Reference refidx="19"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]<Reference refidx="20"/></ListItem><ListItem>Ill-fitting dentures.<Reference refidx="19"/></ListItem><ListItem>Intravenous bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid, denosumab).<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]<Reference refidx="12"/>;<Reference refidx="21"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]</ListItem><ListItem>Time on medication.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="20"/></ListItem><ListItem>Multiple myeloma.<Reference refidx="12"/></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_509">The incidence of ONJ may be reduced by the implementation of dental preventive measures before bisphosphonate therapy is initiated in solid-tumor patients with bone metastases.<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/></Para><SummarySection id="_424"><Title>Diagnosis of ONJ</Title><Para id="_425">Diagnosis of ONJ can be clinically challenging. The most common clinical presentations are as follows:</Para><ItemizedList id="_426" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem><Strong>Classical:</Strong> a cancer patient with skeletal metastasis who is receiving intravenous bisphosphonate or denosumab therapy and who presents with visible necrotic bone in the oral cavity. The site may be infected and painful; these conditions are the typical reason for referral to a dentist. Pain results both from inflammation of the soft tissues contiguous to the necrotic bone and from infection. Other symptoms typically occur in more advanced cases (e.g., paresthesia secondary to local neurologic involvement). Purulent secretion at the exposed area indicates active infection. Radiographic examination may demonstrate typical radiolucent and radiopaque areas associated with a bone sequestrum. Bone trabeculation may present with a moth-eaten appearance, suggesting ongoing bone destruction. Lesions can arise secondary to surgical dental treatments (e.g., dental extractions or periodontal surgery), significant dental infections, or trauma.  Alternatively, ONJ can arise spontaneously, without any detectable trauma or predisposing treatment.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Less common:</Strong> a cancer patient receiving intravenous bisphosphonate or denosumab therapy who complains of pain that mimics periodontal or pulpal pathology. There is no clinically visible exposed necrotic bone, but a draining fistula or purulent secretion from the periodontal sulcus may exist. The involved teeth will typically be symptomatic upon palpation and percussion.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Occasional:</Strong> a cancer patient who complains of oral pain and discomfort, but a definitive diagnosis of ONJ cannot be made because no clinically exposed bone is evident.  In these patients, the most likely clinical diagnosis should be addressed first. It is important to recognize that antiresorptive administration can result in bone pain, including to areas of the head and neck and jaws; this possible etiology for jaw symptoms should be considered as additional dental diagnoses are pursued. Routine clinical pulp testing and assessing for signs and symptoms of periodontal disease (e.g., pocket depths, bone loss, and bleeding on probing) should be performed. Radiographic examination should also be conducted. Although not yet definitively confirmed in the literature, the radiographic finding of sclerosing or absence of the lamina dura of the involved teeth may indicate the early presence of ONJ.<Reference refidx="13"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663087">Level of evidence: III</LOERef>]<Para id="_750">Endodontic and periodontal therapy should be performed first. The patient should be advised about the possibility of ONJ and should be educated about oral hygiene procedures. If dental extraction is indicated, the possibility of subclinical ONJ should be considered and explained to the patient. Thus, delay or absence of healing postextraction must be considered as risk for ultimate development of ONJ. Before the invasive procedure is performed, the risk of excessive bleeding and/or infection due to bone marrow suppression must be discussed with the patient’s physician, and proper preventive measures should be formulated.</Para></ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_427"><Title>Management of ONJ</Title><Para id="_428">Confirmed ONJ with exposed bone in the oral cavity should initially be managed conservatively with local debridement and removal of sharp margins of bone; this reduces the risk of trauma to soft tissue, including the tongue. Systemic antibiotics should be administered when active infection with purulent secretion, swelling and inflammation of the surrounding soft tissues, and pain are present. Initial therapy can be implemented with a single antibiotic, but there is no agreement regarding drug of first choice. Options include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_437" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Amoxicillin, 500 mg 4 times a day for at least 14 days.</ListItem><ListItem>Metronidazole, 250 mg 3 times a day for at least 14 days.</ListItem><ListItem>Clindamycin, 300 mg 4 times a day for at least 14 days.</ListItem><ListItem>Amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, 500 mg 4 times a day for at least 14 days.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_438">In addition, topical oral therapy can be implemented via 0.12% chlorhexidine mouth rinses or tetracycline rinses (62.5 mg/oz)  twice a day.

The local measures should be maintained, however, as part of the routine oral hygiene procedures consisting of brushing and flossing.</Para><Para id="_440">In ONJ cases refractory to therapy, patients may need to be maintained on long-term antibiotic therapy. With these patients, a combination of different antibiotic agents such as penicillin and metronidazole can be considered. Another possibility is to use clindamycin or the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in place of amoxicillin. When the infectious process extends to more critical areas of the head and neck, the patient may need hospitalization and intravenous antibiotic therapy, culminating in the need for extensive surgical resection of the affected areas.<Reference refidx="25"/></Para><Para id="_733">Reports suggest that ONJ can be successfully managed by surgical resection and primary wound closure, especially in cases refractory to conservative therapy.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/> The use of radical surgery is increasing, and it appears that the initial paradigm that surgery should not be done in ONJ cases is no longer true. However, patients must be advised that surgery may result in treatment failure and that not all cases are treated successfully. With surgery as a treatment option, clinicians are now performing bone biopsies to confirm ONJ diagnoses. In cancer patients, there is always a possibility of metastatic disease to the jawbones mimicking ONJ; the final diagnosis should be confirmed by histopathological examination.<Reference refidx="29"/> The use of surgical lasers has also been suggested as an alternative for ONJ patients who do not respond to conservative management.<Reference refidx="30"/></Para><Para id="_442">The use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) to treat cases of established ONJ does not appear to be effective.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/> However, evidence indicates that HBO in addition to discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy may benefit patients with ONJ.<Reference refidx="31"/> Definitive evidence is pending while research in this area continues.<Reference refidx="32"/></Para><Para id="_510">Another possible approach involves surgical manipulation and uses bone labeling with tetracycline.

Bisphosphonates accumulate in a patient’s skeleton and could remain active for several years, especially in patients who have been treated with an intravenous bisphosphonate for longer than a year. There is anecdotal evidence that even with discontinuing zoledronic acid therapy for patients who develop ONJ, the osteonecrotic process clinically progresses and can extend to contiguous sites. However, discontinuing bisphosphonate therapy is advocated by some authors, especially when a procedure to treat ONJ is planned.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="13"/></Para><Para id="_768">Some clinicians believe that discontinuing the drug for patients scheduled for surgery to treat the necrotic area may be beneficial, although this belief is not supported by scientific study.

</Para><Para id="_511">In summary, a potential drug holiday for patients on bisphosphonates must be considered in the context of presence or absence of osteonecrosis. In view of the lack of scientific evidence from randomized controlled studies, risk and benefits of drug discontinuation must be determined by the prescribing physician. In patients who are being treated with bisphosphonate therapy and who need invasive procedures, there is no scientific information that supports a drug holiday and that this will prevent the development of ONJ. In patients with osteonecrosis who need invasive procedures, a drug holiday may be beneficial.<Reference refidx="35"/>  On the other hand, there is emerging evidence that patients with multiple myeloma and osteonecrosis may be maintained on bisphosphonate therapy without the risk of progression of the osteonecrotic process.<Reference refidx="36"/></Para><Para id="_512">It is advisable to discuss with the patient’s physician whether discontinuing bisphosphonate therapy will not put the patient’s general health  at risk.

Unlike the oral complications of chemotherapy that are of shorter duration and significant for only a short period (a few weeks to 2 months) after the cessation of therapy, the oral complications of head and neck radiation are more predictable, are often more severe, and can lead to permanent tissue changes that put the patient at risk for serious chronic complications.</Para><SummarySection id="_281"><Title>Preradiation Dental Evaluation and Oral Disease Stabilization</Title><Para id="_153">Elimination of oral disease and implementation of oral care protocols designed

In addition, invasive oral procedures can cause additional sequelae. Dental care typically needs to be altered because of underlying chronic radiation-induced tissue damage.</Para><Para id="_154">Patients should receive a comprehensive oral evaluation several weeks before high-dose upper-mantle radiation begins.  This timing provides an
appropriate interval for tissue healing in the event that invasive oral procedures,
including dental extractions, dental scaling/polishing, and endodontic therapy,
are necessary. The goal of this evaluation is to identify teeth at significant risk of infection and/or breakdown that would ultimately require aggressive or invasive dental treatment during or after the radiation that increases the risk of soft tissue necroses and osteonecroses.    The likelihood of these
lesions occurring postradiation increases over the patient’s lifetime as the risk of significant dental disease (restorative, periodontal, and endodontic) increases.   Salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia frequently occur postradiation.  It is thus especially important that preradiation dental care strategies are instituted to reduce the impact of the complications of severely decreased saliva secretion and the associated high risk of dental caries.</Para><Para id="_156">In addition, three radiation-specific issues emerge:

HBO has been reported to increase oxygenation of irradiated tissue, promote angiogenesis, and enhance osteoblast repopulation and fibroblast function.
  HBO is usually
prescribed as 20 to 30 dives at 100% oxygen and 2 to 2.5 atmospheres of
pressure.  If surgery is needed, ten dives of postsurgical HBO are recommended.
Unfortunately, HBO technology is not always accessible to patients who might
otherwise benefit because of lack of available units and the high price of care. 
</Para><Para id="_669">A systematic review regarding treatment-dependent frequency, current management strategies, and future studies has been published.<Reference refidx="29"/> A total of 43 articles published between 1990 and 2008 were reviewed.  The weighted prevalence for ORN included the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_782" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Conventional radiation therapy, 7.4%.</ListItem><ListItem>IMRT, 5.1%.</ListItem><ListItem>Chemoradiation therapy, 6.8%.</ListItem><ListItem>Brachytherapy, 5.3%.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_783">HBO may contribute a role in management of ORN.  However, no clear recommendations for the prevention or treatment of ORN could be established on the basis of  the literature reviewed. The review concluded that new cancer treatment modalities such as IMRT and concomitant chemoradiation therapy have had minimal effect on prevalence of ORN.  No studies have systematically addressed the  impact of ORN on either quality of life or cost of care.   Research addressing these collective issues is needed.</Para><Para id="_671">Partial mandibulectomy may be necessary in severe cases of ORN.  The mandible
can be reconstructed to provide continuity for esthetics and function.  A
multidisciplinary cancer team that includes oncologists, oncology nurses,
maxillofacial prosthodontists, general dentists, hygienists, and physical
therapists is appropriate for management of these patients.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_672"><Title>Tissue Necrosis</Title><Para id="_673">Necrosis and secondary infection of previously irradiated tissue is a serious
complication for patients who have undergone radiation therapy for head and neck
tumors.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Acute effects typically involve oral mucosa.  Chronic changes
involving bone and mucosa are a result of the process of vascular inflammation
and scarring that in turn result in hypovascular, hypocellular, and hypoxic
changes.  Infection secondary to tissue injury and osteonecrosis 
confounds the process.
</Para><Para id="_674">Soft tissue necrosis  can involve any mucosal surface in the mouth, though nonkeratinized surfaces appear to be at moderately higher risk.  Trauma and injury are often associated with nonhealing soft tissue necrotic lesions, though spontaneous lesions are also reported.  Soft tissue necrosis begins as an ulcerative break in the mucosal surface and can spread in diameter and depth.  Pain will generally become more prominent as soft tissue necrosis becomes worse.  Secondary infection is a risk.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_675"><Title>Mandibular Dysfunction</Title><Para id="_676">Musculoskeletal syndromes may develop secondary to radiation therapy and surgery. 
Lesions include soft tissue fibrosis, surgically induced mandibular
discontinuity, and parafunctional habits associated with emotional stress
caused by cancer and its treatment.  Patients can be instructed in physical
therapy interventions such as mandibular stretching exercises and the use
of prosthetic aids designed to reduce the severity of fibrosis.  It is important
that these approaches be instituted before trismus develops.  If
clinically significant changes develop, several approaches can be considered, including
the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_784" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Stabilization of occlusion.</ListItem><ListItem>Use of trigger-point injection and other pain management
strategies.</ListItem><ListItem>Use of muscle relaxants.</ListItem><ListItem>Use of tricyclic medications.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_677"><Title>Trismus</Title><Para id="_678">Trismus has been associated with significant morbidity post–radiation therapy, with significant health implications, including reduced nutrition due to impaired mastication, difficulty in speaking, and compromised oral hygiene.<Reference refidx="30"/> Limitations in jaw opening have been reported in 6% to 86% of patients who received radiation to the temporomandibular joint  and/or masseter/pterygoid muscles, with frequency and severity that are somewhat unpredictable.<Reference refidx="31"/></Para><Para id="_679">The loss of function and range of mandibular motion from radiation therapy appears to be related to fibrosis in  and damage to the muscles of mastication. Studies have demonstrated that an abnormal proliferation of fibroblasts is an important initial event in these reactions. Additionally, there may be scar tissue from radiation therapy  or surgery, nerve damage, or a combination of these factors. Regardless of the immediate cause, mandibular hypomobility will ultimately result in degeneration of both muscle and temporomandibular joint. </Para><Para id="_680">Radiation therapy involving the temporomandibular joint, the pterygoid muscles, or the masseter muscle is most likely to result in trismus.<Reference refidx="30"/>
  Tumors related to this type of radiation can appear in the following locations:</Para><ItemizedList id="_792" Style="bullet"><ListItem> Nasopharynx.</ListItem><ListItem>Oral cavity.</ListItem><ListItem>Oropharynx.</ListItem><ListItem>Base of tongue.</ListItem><ListItem>Salivary gland.</ListItem><ListItem>Maxilla or mandible.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_793">The prevalence of trismus increases with increasing doses of radiation, and levels in excess of 60 Gy are more likely to cause trismus.<Reference refidx="5"/>
 Patients who have been previously irradiated and who are being treated for a recurrence appear to be at higher risk of trismus than those who are receiving their first treatment.<Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/>
  This suggests that the effects of radiation are cumulative, even over many years. Radiation-induced trismus may begin toward the end of radiation therapy or at any time during the subsequent 24 months. Limitations in opening the mouth often increase slowly over several weeks or months. The condition may worsen over time or  remain the same, or the symptoms may reduce over time, even in the absence of treatment.</Para><Para id="_682">Limited mouth opening frequently results in reduced nutritional status. These patients may experience significant weight loss and nutritional deficits.<Reference refidx="34"/>
 It is generally accepted that weight loss of more than 10% of initial body weight is considered significant. This is of particular importance at a time when the patient is recovering from surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. Additionally, it lowers the ability for social eating and thereby increases the risk of social isolation and decrease in quality of life in patients with HNC.</Para><Para id="_683">Finally, limited mouth opening can result in compromised oral hygiene. Patients who have undergone radiation therapy involving the salivary glands must maintain excellent oral hygiene to prevent dental caries. Deficits in oral hygiene can aggravate mucosal and dental problems, with the subsequent risk of mandibular ORN. Also, dental work and other professional oral care measures such as surgery can be made more difficult, which might even result in compromised oncologic follow-up.</Para><Para id="_684">The weighted prevalence of trismus with conventional radiation is estimated to be 25%, but 5% with IMRT only. Trismus prevalence in studies of chemoradiation is approximately 30%.<Reference refidx="35"/></Para><SummarySection id="_740"><Title>Prevention strategies</Title><Para id="_741">Early treatment of trismus has the potential to prevent or minimize many of the consequences of this condition. If the clinical examination reveals the presence of limited mouth opening, and diagnosis determines the condition to be trismus, treatment should begin as soon as is practical. As restriction becomes more severe and likely irreversible, the need for treatment becomes more urgent.</Para><Para id="_832">Over the years, clinicians have attempted to prevent or treat trismus with a wide array of appliances. These devices include the following: </Para><ItemizedList id="_742" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Cages that fit over the head.</ListItem><ListItem>Heavy springs that fit between the teeth.</ListItem><ListItem>Screws that are placed between the central incisors.</ListItem><ListItem>Hydraulic bulbs placed between the teeth.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_743">These devices range widely in cost. Some devices, such as continuous passive motion devices, must be custom made for each patient; others are rented on a daily or weekly basis, at rates of up to several hundred dollars per week. The least expensive option is the use of tongue depressors, which has been used for many years to mobilize the jaw. A search of the literature, however, failed to reveal any studies that demonstrated significant improvement in treating trismus with tongue depressors.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_744"><Title>Curative approach</Title><Para id="_745">Some therapeutic interventions seem to show some efficacy in decreasing the intensity of cancer treatment–related trismus (e.g., pentoxifylline,<Reference refidx="36"/><Reference refidx="37"/>
 Botulinum toxin,<Reference refidx="38"/> exercise using the Therabite device,<Reference refidx="39"/>
 and the Dynasplint Trismus System  <Reference refidx="40"/>). However, this proposed efficacy must be confirmed by randomized controlled studies, which are lacking in this area.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_746"><Title>Recommendations for future research directions</Title><Para id="_747">Radiation oncology textbooks often fail to mention trismus as a sequela of radiation therapy for HNC patients, contributing  to a lack of recognition of the prevalence and significance of this condition. There has been an ongoing attempt by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group  and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer  to develop LENT (late effects in normal tissue) morbidity scales. The National Cancer Institute consensus conferences introduced the SOMA (subjective, objective, management, analysis) classification for late toxicity. However, both scales are focused on major organ and dermatological injuries, and trismus is not addressed. This should be corrected in future revisions of these scales.</Para><Para id="_748">Considering the high prevalence of trismus in published studies and the  deficits in quality of life associated with trismus, increased efforts for patient education, prevention, and early treatment options are warranted. Larger prospective trials that include the prevention and treatment of trismus are needed to improve management and to confirm the benefit of IMRT in the reduction of radiation-induced trismus and the quality-of-life and economic impact of this common oral sequela of radiation.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_TrialSearch_588_sid_16"><Title>Current Clinical Trials</Title><Para id="_TrialSearch_588_13">Check NCI’s list of cancer clinical trials for U.S. supportive and palliative care trials about

Almost all patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy will become fully dependent on enteral nutritional support within 3 to 4 weeks of therapy.  Numerous studies have demonstrated the benefit of enteral feedings initiated at the onset of treatment, before significant weight loss has occurred.<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/></Para><Para id="_585">Oral nutrition is reinstituted after treatment has concluded and the radiated site has adequately healed. Oral nutrition often requires a team approach. The assistance of a speech and swallowing therapist to assess for any swallowing dysfunction resulting from surgery or treatment is often necessary and beneficial in easing the transition back to solid foods.  The number of tube feedings can be decreased as a patient's oral intake increases, with tube feeding being discontinued when  75% of a patient's nutrition needs are being met orally. Although most patients will resume adequate oral intake, many will continue to experience chronic complications such as taste changes, xerostomia, and varying degrees of dysphagia that can affect their nutritional status and quality of life.<Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_202"><Title>Fatigue</Title><Para id="_203">Cancer patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy can
experience fatigue related to either the disease or its treatment.<Reference refidx="24"/>  These
processes can produce sleep deprivation or metabolic disorders that
collectively contribute to compromised oral status.  For example, the fatigued
patient will likely have impaired compliance with mouth care protocols designed
to otherwise minimize risk of mucosal ulceration, infection, and pain.  In
addition, biochemical abnormalities are likely involved in many patients.  The
psychosocial component can also play a major role, with depression contributing
to overall fatigue.  (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062734" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/fatigue/fatigue-hp-pdq">Fatigue</SummaryRef> for more

long-term problems encountered by people with cancer because they affect eating and communication, the
most basic of human activities.  Patients with these problems can become withdrawn, socially
avoidant, and even clinically depressed as a result of the difficulties and
frustrations they encounter living with oral complications.</Para><Para id="_788">When psychotropic drug interventions are employed  in the treatment of such patients, it is important
that the drugs chosen  will improve, or at least not worsen, their
oral complications.  For example, in the treatment of depression, highly anticholinergic drugs should be avoided in patients with
xerostomia and salivary problems.  (Refer to the PDQ summaries on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062891" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/anxiety-distress-hp-pdq">Adjustment to Cancer: Anxiety and Distress</SummaryRef> and

</Para><Para id="_301">Supportive care, including education and symptom management, are important for
patients experiencing oral complications related to cancer therapy.  It is
important to closely monitor each patient’s level of distress, ability to cope,
and response to treatment.  This approach provides a setting for the health
professional to demonstrate concern for the patient’s complications and to
educate the patient and family caregivers.  Comprehensive supportive care from
staff and family can enhance the patient’s ability to cope with cancer and its
complications.
