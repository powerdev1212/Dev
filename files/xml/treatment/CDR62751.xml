     <ListItem><Strong>Overdiagnosis and Resulting Treatment of Insignificant Cancers</Strong>: Diagnosis of cancers that would otherwise never have caused symptoms or death in a woman’s lifetime can expose a woman to the immediate risks of therapy (surgical deformity or toxicities from radiation therapy, hormone therapy, or chemotherapy), late sequelae (lymphedema), and late effects of therapeutic radiation (new cancers, scarring, or cardiac toxicity). Although the specific plan of recommended treatment is typically tailored to individual tumor characteristics, at this time, there is no reliable way to distinguish which cancer would never progress in an individual patient; therefore, some treatment is nearly always recommended.<ItemizedList id="_26" Style="simple" Compact="No">

By comparison, about  71,660 American women are estimated to die of lung cancer in 2015.<Reference refidx="1"/> Males account for 1% of breast cancer cases and breast cancer deaths (refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062751#_123" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq">Special Populations</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information).</Para><Para id="_44">Widespread adoption of screening increases breast cancer incidence in a given population and changes the characteristics of cancers detected, with increased incidence of lower-risk cancers, premalignant lesions, and ductal carcinoma <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> (DCIS). (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062751#_66" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq">Ductal Carcinoma In Situ</SummaryRef> section in the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062751#_4" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq">Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Pathology</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information.)  Ecologic studies from the United States <Reference refidx="2"/> and the United Kingdom <Reference refidx="3"/> demonstrate an increase in DCIS and invasive breast cancer incidence since the 1970s, attributable to the widespread adoption of both postmenopausal hormone therapy and screening mammography.   In the last decade, women have refrained from using postmenopausal hormones, and breast cancer incidence has declined, but not to the levels seen prior to the widespread use of screening mammography.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_45">One might expect that if screening identifies cancers before they cause clinical symptoms, then the period of screening will be followed by a period of compensatory decline in cancer rates, either in annual population incidence rates or in incidence rates in older women. However, no compensatory drop in incidence rates has ever been seen following the adoption of screening, suggesting that screening leads to overdiagnosis—the identification of clinically insignificant cancers (refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062751#_423" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq">Overdiagnosis</SummaryRef> section in the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062751#_402" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq">Harms of Screening</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information).</Para><Para id="_46">Breast cancer incidence and mortality risk also vary according to geography, culture, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062751#_123" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq">Special Populations</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information). </Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_47"><Title>Risk Factors for Breast Cancer</Title><Para id="_48">Breast cancer risk is affected by many factors besides participation in screening activities.

During a 10-year period, 16% of 2,400 women aged 40 to 69 years sought medical attention for breast symptoms at their health maintenance organization.<Reference refidx="1"/> Women younger than 50 years were twice as likely to seek evaluation. Additional testing was performed in 66% of these women, including invasive procedures performed in 27%. Cancer was diagnosed in 6.2%, most often stage II or III. Of the breast symptoms prompting medical attention, a mass was most likely to lead to a cancer diagnosis (10.7%) and pain was least likely (1.8%) to do so.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_64"><Title>Pathologic Diagnosis of Breast Cancer</Title><Para id="_65">Breast cancer is most often diagnosed by pathologic review of a fixed specimen of breast tissue. The breast tissue can be obtained from a symptomatic area or from an area identified by an imaging test. A palpable lesion can be biopsied with core needle biopsy or, less often, fine-needle aspiration biopsy or surgical excision; image guidance improves accuracy. Nonpalpable lesions can be sampled by core needle biopsy using stereotactic x-ray or ultrasound guidance or can be surgically excised after image-guided localization. In a retrospective study of 939 patients with 1,042 mammographically detected lesions who underwent core needle biopsy or surgical needle localization under x-ray guidance, sensitivity for malignancy was greater than 95% and the specificity was greater than 90%. Compared with surgical needle localization under x-ray guidance, core needle biopsy resulted in fewer surgical procedures for definitive treatment, with a higher likelihood of clear surgical margins at the initial excision.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_66"><Title>Ductal Carcinoma <Emphasis>In Situ</Emphasis></Title><Para id="_67">Ductal carcinoma <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> (DCIS) is a noninvasive condition that can evolve to invasive cancer, with variable frequency and time course.<Reference refidx="3"/> Some authors include DCIS with invasive breast cancer statistics, but others argue that the term be replaced by ductal intraepithelial neoplasia, similar to the terminology used for cervical and prostate precursor lesions, and that breast cancer statistics exclude these DCIS cases.</Para><Para id="_68">DCIS is most often diagnosed by mammography. In the United States, only 4,900 women were diagnosed with DCIS in 1983, compared with approximately 64,000 women who are expected to be diagnosed in  2013, when mammographic screening has been widely adopted.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>  The Canadian National Breast Screening Study-2 of women aged 50 to 59 years found a fourfold increase in DCIS cases in women screened by clinical breast examination (CBE) plus mammography compared with those screened by CBE alone, with no difference in breast cancer mortality.<Reference refidx="6"/> (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062787" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-treatment-pdq">Breast Cancer Treatment</SummaryRef> for more information.)</Para><Para id="_69">The natural history of DCIS is poorly understood because nearly all DCIS cases are treated. A single retrospective review of 11,760 breast biopsies performed between 1952 and 1968  identified 28 cases of DCIS,<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> which were detected by physical examination, biopsied without resection, and then followed for 30 years.  Nine women developed invasive breast cancer and four women died of the disease.  These findings are interesting but probably not relevant to women with screen-detected DCIS in an era of improved cancer care.</Para><Para id="_208">Development of breast cancer after treatment of DCIS depends on the characteristics of the lesion but also on the delivered treatment. One large randomized trial found that 13.4% of women treated by lumpectomy alone developed ipsilateral invasive breast cancer within 90 months, compared with 3.9% of those treated by lumpectomy and radiation.<Reference refidx="9"/>   The best evidence indicates that most DCIS lesions will not evolve to invasive cancer and that those that do can still usually be managed successfully, even after that transition.  Thus, the detection and treatment of nonpalpable DCIS often represents overdiagnosis and overtreatment.</Para><Para id="_70">Among women diagnosed with (and treated for) DCIS between 1984 and 1989, only 1.9% died of breast cancer within 10 years,<Reference refidx="10"/> which was a lower mortality rate than for the  age-matched population at large.  This favorable outcome may reflect the benign nature of the condition, the benefits of treatment, or the volunteer effect (women undergoing breast cancer screening are generally healthier than those who do not).</Para><Para id="_71">Attempts to define low-risk DCIS cases that can be managed with fewer therapies are important.  One such effort analyzed a series of 706 DCIS patients who were monitored to develop the University of Southern California/Van Nuys Prognostic Scoring Index, which defines the risk of recurrent DCIS and invasive cancer among women with DCIS based on age, margin width, tumor size, and grade.<Reference refidx="11"/>  The low-risk group, comprising a third of the cases, experienced only 1% DCIS recurrences  and no invasive cancers, independent of the use of postoperative radiation therapy. The moderate- and high-risk groups had higher recurrence rates, and they benefited from postlumpectomy radiation therapy. Overall, only approximately 1% died of breast cancer.  In a separate study, adjuvant tamoxifen therapy was shown to reduce the incidence of invasive breast cancer.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="10215561">Barton MB, Elmore JG, Fletcher SW: Breast symptoms among women enrolled in a health maintenance organization: frequency, evaluation, and outcome.

In tomosynthesis, multiple short-exposure x-rays are obtained at different angles as the x-ray tube moves over the breast.  This process takes a few seconds longer than a standard mammogram.  Individual images are then reconstructed into a series of thin slices that can be viewed individually or like a movie. Cancers and other abnormalities are detected because of differences in density and shape compared with surrounding tissue, with some cancers and other findings causing architectural distortion.  Overlapping tissues can be more easily recognized accurately as normal with tomosynthesis, and some cancers are better seen than on standard mammography.  In some centers, tomosynthesis-guided biopsy may be available because some cancers seen only on tomosynthesis cannot be found with ultrasound.</Para><Para id="_538">The combination of 2-D and 3-D mammography has been reported to be more accurate than 2-D mammography alone, with respect to both improved detection of breast cancer (averaging added yield of 1.3/1,000, similar to CAD) and, importantly, reduction in recall rates.

Some trials used individual randomization, while others used cluster randomization in which cohorts were identified and then offered screening; one trial used nonrandomized allocation by day of birth in any given month. Cluster randomization sometimes led to imbalances between the intervention and control groups. Age differences have been identified in several trials, although the differences were probably too small to have a major effect on the trial outcome.<Reference refidx="43"/> In the Edinburgh Trial, socioeconomic status, which correlates with the risk of breast cancer mortality, differed markedly between the intervention and control groups, so it is difficult, if not impossible, to interpret the results.</Para><Para id="_96">Breast cancer mortality is the major outcome parameter for each of these trials, so the methods used to determine cause of death are critically important. Efforts to reduce bias in the attribution of mortality cause have been made, including the use of a blinded monitoring committee (New York) and a linkage to independent data sources, such as national mortality registries (Swedish trials). Unfortunately, these attempts could not ensure a lack of knowledge of women’s assignments to screening or control arms. Evidence of possible misclassification of breast cancer deaths in the Two-County Trial with possible bias in favor of screening has been analyzed.<Reference refidx="44"/></Para><Para id="_97">There were also differences in the methodology used to analyze the results of these trials. Four of the five Swedish trials were designed to include a single screening mammogram in the control group, timed to correspond with the end of the series of screening mammograms in the study group. The initial analysis of these trials used an "evaluation" analysis, tallying only the breast cancer deaths that occurred in women whose cancer was discovered at or before the last study mammogram. In some of the trials a delay occurred in the performance of the end-of-study mammogram, resulting in more time for members of the control group to develop or be diagnosed with breast cancer. Other trials used a "follow-up" analysis, which counts all deaths attributed to breast cancer, regardless of the time of diagnosis. This type of analysis was used in a meta-analysis of four of the five Swedish trials in response to concerns about the evaluation analyses.<Reference refidx="44"/></Para><Para id="_98">The accessibility of the data for international audits and verification also varies, with formal audit having been undertaken only in the Canadian trials. Other trials have been audited to varying degrees, usually with less rigor.<Reference refidx="45"/></Para><Para id="_99">All of these studies are designed to study breast cancer mortality rather than all-cause mortality because of the infrequency of breast cancer deaths relative to the total number of deaths. When all-cause mortality in these trials was examined retrospectively, only the Edinburgh Trial showed a significant difference, which could be attributed to socioeconomic differences. The meta-analysis (follow-up methods) of the four Swedish trials also showed a small but significant improvement of all-cause mortality.</Para><Para id="_100">Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062751#_377" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq">Appendix of Randomized Controlled Trials</SummaryRef> section of this summary for a detailed description of the trials.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_101"><Title>Summary of RCTs</Title><Para id="_102">Screening for breast cancer does not affect overall mortality, and the absolute benefit for breast cancer mortality is small.</Para><Para id="_103">A way to view the potential benefit of breast cancer screening is to estimate the number of lives extended because of early breast cancer detection.<Reference refidx="46"/><Reference refidx="47"/> One author estimated the outcomes of 10,000 women aged 50 to 70 years who undergo a single screen.<Reference refidx="48"/> Mammograms will be normal (true-negatives and false-negatives) in 9,500 women. Of the 500 abnormal screens, 466 to 479 will be false-positives, and 100 to 200 of these women will undergo invasive procedures. The remaining 21 to 34 abnormal screens will be true-positives, indicating breast cancer. Some of these women will die of breast cancer in spite of mammographic detection and optimal therapy, and some may live long enough to die of other causes even if the cancer had not been screen detected. The number of extended lives attributable to mammographic detection is between two and six. Another expression of this analysis is that one life may be extended per 1,700 to 5,000 women screened and followed for 15 years. The same analysis for 10,000 women aged 40 to 49 years, assuming the same 500 abnormal examinations,  results in an estimate that 488 of these will be false-positives, and 12 will be breast cancer. Of these 12, there will probably be only one or two lives extended. Thus, for women aged 40 to 49 years, it is estimated that one or two lives may be extended per 5,000 to 10,000 mammograms.</Para><Para id="_104">While the numbers discussed above are from a single mammography exam, women undergo screening throughout their lifetimes, which can include 20 to 30 years of screening activity.  A meta-analysis of RCTs conducted for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2009 (including the AGE Trial) found that the number needed to invite to screen for 10 years to avoid or delay one death from breast cancer was 1,904 for women in their 40s, 1,339 for women in their 50s, and 377 for women in their 60s.<Reference refidx="49"/> A 2009 combined analysis by six Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network modeling groups found that screening every 2 years maintained an average of 81% of the benefit of annual screening with almost half the false-positive results. Screening biennially from age 50 to 69 years achieved a median 16.5% reduction in breast cancer deaths versus no screening. Initiating biennial screening at age 40 years (vs. age 50 years) reduced breast cancer mortality by an additional 3%, consumed more resources, and yielded more false-positive results.<Reference refidx="50"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_105"><Title>Effectiveness of Population-Based Screening Programs </Title><Para id="_106">Although the RCTs of screening have addressed the issue of screening efficacy (i.e., the extent to which screening reduces breast cancer mortality under the ideal conditions of an RCT), they do not provide information about the effectiveness of screening (i.e., the extent to which screening is reducing breast cancer mortality in the U.S. population). Studies that provide information about this issue include nonrandomized controlled studies of screened versus nonscreened populations, case-control studies of screening in real communities, and modeling studies that examine the impact of screening on large populations. An important issue in all of these studies is the extent to which they can control for additional effects on breast cancer mortality such as improved treatment and heightened awareness of breast cancer in the community.</Para><Para id="_107">Three population-based, observational studies from Sweden compared breast cancer mortality in the presence and absence of screening mammography programs. One study compared two adjacent time periods in 7 of the 25 counties in Sweden and concluded a statistically significant breast cancer mortality reduction of 18% to 32% attributable to screening.<Reference refidx="51"/> The most important bias in this study is that the advent of screening in these counties occurred over a period during which dramatic improvements in the effectiveness of adjuvant breast cancer therapy were being made, changes which were not addressed by the study authors. The second study considered an 11-year period comparing seven counties with screening programs with five counties without them.<Reference refidx="52"/> There was a trend in favor of screening, but again, the authors did not consider the effect of adjuvant therapy or differences in geography (urban vs. rural) that might affect treatment practices.</Para><Para id="_394">In part to account for the effects of treatment, the third study was a detailed analysis by county and concluded little impact of screening.<Reference refidx="53"/> These authors made the  assumption that the annual decrease in mortality observed during the prescreening period would carry into the postscreening period, and any screening effect would result in an incremental decrease in mortality. Although no such incremental decrease in breast cancer mortality was observed after the introduction of screening, their assumption makes their conclusion weak. Comparisons across counties showed similar reductions in decreased breast cancer mortality regardless of when the counties’ screening programs were initiated; however, the authors carried out no formal cross-county analyses.</Para><Para id="_108">In Nijmegen, the Netherlands, where a population-based screening program was undertaken in 1975, a case-cohort study showed that screened women have decreased mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.48).<Reference refidx="54"/>  However, a subsequent study comparing Nijmegen breast cancer mortality rates with neighboring Arnhem in the Netherlands, which had no screening program, showed no difference in breast cancer mortality.<Reference refidx="55"/></Para><Para id="_109">A community-based case-control study of screening as practiced in excellent U.S. health care systems between 1983 and 1998 found no association between previous screening and reduced breast cancer mortality. Mammography screening rates, however, were generally low.<Reference refidx="56"/>  The association among women at increased risk due to a family history of breast cancer or a previous breast biopsy (OR, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50–1.03) was stronger than that among women at average risk (OR, 0.96; 95% CI,  0.80–1.14), but the difference was not statistically significant (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .17).<Reference refidx="56"/></Para><Para id="_212">A well-conducted ecologic study compared three pairs of neighboring European countries, matched on similarity in health care systems and population structure, one of which had started a national screening program some years earlier than the others.  The investigators found that each country had experienced a reduction in breast cancer mortality, with no difference between matched pairs that could be attributed to screening.  The authors suggested that improvements in breast cancer treatment and/or health care organizations were more likely responsible for the reduction in mortality than was screening.<Reference refidx="57"/></Para><Para id="_213">A systematic review of ecologic and large cohort studies published  through March 2011 compared breast cancer mortality in large populations of women aged 50 to 69 years who started breast cancer screening at different times.  Seventeen studies met inclusion criteria.  All studies had methodological problems, including control group dissimilarities, insufficient adjustment for differences between areas in breast cancer risk and breast cancer treatment, and problems with similar measurement of breast cancer mortality between compared areas.  There was great variation in results among the studies, with four studies finding a relative reduction in breast cancer mortality of 33% or more (with wide CIs) and five studies finding no reduction in breast cancer mortality.   Because only a part of the overall reduction in breast cancer mortality could possibly be attributed to screening, the review concluded that any relative reduction in breast cancer mortality resulting from screening would likely be no more than 10%, less than predicted by the RCTs.<Reference refidx="58"/></Para><Para id="_396">A U.S. ecologic analysis conducted between 1976 and 2008 examined the incidence of early-stage versus late-stage breast cancer for women aged 40 years and older.  To find a screening effect, the authors compared the magnitude of increase in early-stage cancer with the magnitude of an expected decrease in late-stage cancer.  Over the study period, the absolute increase in the incidence of early-stage cancer was 122 cancers per 100,000 women, while the absolute decrease in late-stage cancers was 8 cases per 100,000 women.  After adjusting for changes in incidence resulting from hormone therapy and other undefined causes, the authors concluded that the screening effect on breast cancer mortality reduction (28% during this period) was small, and that overdiagnosis of breast cancer was likely between 22% and 31% of all diagnosed breast cancers.  Most of the reduction in breast cancer mortality, the authors concluded, was probably because of improved treatment rather than screening. To make these adjustments, the authors made uncertain assumptions about the effects of other factors on incidence, and made no mention of the effects of changing treatment over time.  Ecologic studies are difficult to interpret because of this type of potential uncontrolled confounding, as well as  these types of unfair comparisons. However, this study largely agrees with some similar analyses from other countries (see studies discussed above).<Reference refidx="59"/> A major limitation of this and other ecologic studies is the failure to account for actual exposure to screening.  Most late-stage breast cancer occurs in women not exposed to screening.</Para><Para id="_452">A prospective cohort study of community-based screening programs in the United States found that annual compared with biennial screening mammography did not reduce the proportion of unfavorable breast cancers detected in women aged 50 to 74 years or in women aged 40 to 49 years who did not have extremely dense breasts.  Women aged 40 to 49 years with extremely dense breasts did have a reduction in cancers larger than 2.0 cm (OR for biennial vs. annual screening, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.37–4.18).<Reference refidx="60"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_110"><Title>Statistical Modeling of Breast Cancer Incidence and Mortality in the United States</Title><Para id="_214">The optimal screening interval has been addressed by modelers. Modeling makes assumptions that may not be correct; however, the credibility of modeling is greater when the model produces overall results that are consistent with randomized trials overall and when the model is used to interpolate or extrapolate. For example, if a model’s output agrees with RCT outcomes for annual screening, it has greater credibility in comparing the relative effectiveness of biennial versus annual screening.</Para><Para id="_220">In 2000, the National Cancer Institute formed a consortium of modeling groups (Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling [CISNET]) to address the relative contribution of screening and adjuvant therapy to the observed decline in breast cancer mortality in the United States.<Reference refidx="61"/> (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062751#_94" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq">Randomized controlled trials</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information.) These models gave reductions in breast cancer mortality similar to those expected in the circumstances of the RCTs but updated to the use of modern adjuvant therapy. In 2009, CISNET modelers addressed several questions related to the harms and benefits of mammography, including comparing annual versus biennial screening.<Reference refidx="50"/> The proportion of reduction in breast cancer mortality maintained in moving from annual to biennial screening for women aged 50 to 74 years ranged across the six models from 72% to 95%, with a median of 80%.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="9680578" MedlineID="98345529">Sickles EA: Findings at mammographic screening on only one standard projection: outcomes analysis.

Assuming an average sensitivity of 80%, mammograms will miss approximately 20% of the breast cancers that are present at the time of screening (false-negatives).  Many of these missed cancers are high risk, with adverse biologic characteristics (refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062751#_85" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq">Interval cancers</SummaryRef> section in the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062751#_49" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-screening-pdq">Breast Cancer Screening Concepts</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information). If a "normal" mammogram dissuades or postpones a woman or her doctor from evaluating breast symptoms, she may suffer adverse consequences. Thus, a negative mammogram should never prevent work-up of breast symptoms.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_429"><Title>Discomfort</Title><Para id="_430">Compression of the breast is important during a mammogram to reduce motion artifact and improve image quality.

For women older than 40 years, the benefits of annual mammograms probably outweigh the potential risk,<Reference refidx="29"/> but certain subpopulations of women may have an inherited susceptibility to ionizing radiation damage.<Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="31"/> In the United States, the mean glandular dose for screening mammography is 1  to 2 mSv  per view or 2 mSv to 4 mSv per standard two-view exam.<Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/> The radiation exposure from mammography is to the breasts, with a  lower effective dose to the whole body of 0.29 mSv. By comparison, a single chest computed tomography (CT) scan delivers 7 mSv and an abdominal CT scan delivers 12 to 20 mSv. The whole-body environmental radiation dose is approximately 3 mSv per year. Thus, it may be estimated that up to one breast cancer may be induced per 1,000 women aged 40 to 80 years undergoing annual mammograms.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_431"><Title>Anxiety</Title><Para id="_432">Because large numbers of women have false-positive tests, the issue of psychological distress—which may be provoked by the additional testing—has been studied.

Such women might have end-stage renal disease, severe dementia, terminal cancer, or severe comorbid disease with  functional dependencies in activities of daily living. Early cancer detection and prompt treatment are unlikely to reduce morbidity or mortality within a woman's 5 years of expected survival, but the negative consequences of screening will occur immediately. Abnormal screening may trigger additional testing, with the attendant anxiety. In particular, the detection of a low-risk malignancy would probably result in a recommendation for treatment, which could impair rather than improve quality of life, without improving survival. Despite these considerations, many women with poor life expectancy due to  age or health status often undergo screening mammography.<Reference refidx="1"/> A sizable proportion of patients with advanced cancer continue to undergo cancer screening tests that do not have a meaningful likelihood of providing benefit.  For example, among women with advanced cancer compared with controls, at least one screening mammogram was received by 8.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6%–9.1%) versus 22.0% (95% CI, 21.7%–22.5%).<Reference refidx="2"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_146"><Title>Older women</Title><Para id="_218">Screening mammography in women older than 65 years often results in additional diagnostic testing in 85 per 1,000 women, with cancer diagnosed in nine women. The testing is often accomplished over many months, which may cause anxiety.<Reference refidx="3"/> While screening mammography may yield cancer diagnoses in approximately 1% of elderly women, many of these cancers are low risk. A study of California Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 to 79 years demonstrated this clearly. The relative risk (RR) of detecting localized breast cancer was 3.3 (95% CI, 3.1–3.5) among screened women. Diagnosis of metastatic cancer was reduced among screened women (RR, 0.57), suggesting a benefit of mammography screening in elderly women, although it comes with an increased risk of overdiagnosis.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_148"><Title>Young women</Title><Para id="_149">There is no evidence for performing screening mammography in average-risk women younger than 40 years.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_150"><Title>Men</Title><Para id="_151">Approximately 1% of all breast cancers occur in men.

One systematic review of observational studies of women exposed to large doses (≥20 Gy) of chest radiation before age 30 years found standardized incidence ratios of 13.3 to 55.5 for breast cancer, with no plateau with increasing age.<Reference refidx="5"/> Screening mammography and magnetic resonance imaging can identify early-stage cancers in these women, but the benefits and risks have not been clearly defined.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_155"><Title>Race</Title><Para id="_156">Although age-adjusted breast cancer incidence rates are higher in white women than in black women, mortality rates are higher in black women. Among breast cancer cases diagnosed from 2004 to 2010, 62% of white women and only 52% of black women had localized disease. The 5-year relative survival rate for localized disease was 99.1% for white women and 94.0% for black women; for regional disease, it was 86.0% for white women and 74.6% for black women; and for distant disease, it was 26.2% for white women and 16.4% for black women.<Reference refidx="6"/> Both breast cancer incidence and mortality are lower among Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander women than among white and black women.<Reference refidx="6"/> Survival in black women may be worse than in white women at least in part because of a higher frequency of adverse histologic features, such as a triple-negative phenotype.<Reference refidx="7"/> </Para><Para id="_157">Several explanations for these findings have been proposed, including lower socioeconomic status, lower level of education, and less access to screening and treatment services. Population-based studies demonstrate that, compared with other groups, Medicaid recipients and uninsured patients of all races have later-stage breast cancer diagnosis, and survival from the time of diagnosis is shorter. These differences are associated with socioeconomic status and may reflect lack of participation in screening activities.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/> Black women older than 65 years are less likely to undergo mammogram screening. Among regular users of mammography, however, cancer was diagnosed in black and white women at similar stages.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_158">Similar studies of Hispanic populations have been conducted. Breast cancer stage at diagnosis in San Diego County, California, was more advanced for Hispanic women than for white women, especially for those younger than 50 years. Low-income whites were more likely to have late-stage diagnosis than high-income whites. Among Hispanic women, there was no difference according to income, but all the Hispanic groups were at or below the lowest white income level.<Reference refidx="11"/> In New Mexico, a population-based case-control study examined the reproductive histories of 719 Hispanic and 836 white breast cancer patients, with half of each group having breast cancer. The Hispanic women had higher body mass index, higher parity, and earlier pregnancies.<Reference refidx="12"/> Whereas reproductive factors such as age at first full-term birth, parity, and duration of lactation accounted for some of the ethnic differences in breast cancer incidence for postmenopausal women, there was no evidence that these factors played a role in the differences for premenopausal patients. A study of mammography screening in an Albuquerque health maintenance organization found that Hispanic women had consistently lower rates of screening than did whites (50.6% vs. 65.5% in 1989, and 62.7% vs. 71.6% in 1996).<Reference refidx="13"/> Predictors of more advanced stage at diagnosis included Hispanic race (odds ratio, 2.12) and younger age. </Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="15126251">Walter LC, Lindquist K, Covinsky KE: Relationship between health status and use of screening mammography and Papanicolaou smears among women older than 70 years of age.

<Strong>Cause of death attribution:</Strong>   Women who died of breast cancer that had been diagnosed before entry into the study were excluded from the comparison between the screening and control groups. However, these exclusions were determined differently within the two groups. Women in the screening 
group were excluded based on determinations made during the study 
period at their initial screening visits. These women were dropped 
from all further consideration in the study. By design, controls did 
not have regular clinic visits, so the prestudy cancer status of 
control patients was not determined. When a control patient died and 
her cause of death was determined to be breast cancer, a 
retrospective examination was made to determine the date of diagnosis 
of her disease. If this was prior to the study period then she was 
excluded from the analysis. This difference in methodology has the 
potential for a substantial bias in comparing breast cancer mortality 
between the two groups, and this bias is likely to favor screening.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Analysis:</Strong> Follow-up.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>External audit:</Strong> No.

 This is the only trial specifically designed to study women aged 40
to 49 years.  Cancers diagnosed at entry in both study and control groups were
included.  Concerns were expressed prior to completion of the trial about
the technical adequacy of the MMGs, the training of the radiologists, and the
standardization of the equipment, which prompted an independent external
review.  The primary deficiency identified by this review was the use of the
mediolateral view from 1980 to 1985 instead of the mediolateral oblique view,
which was used after 1985.<Reference refidx="13"/>  Subsequent analyses found the size and stage
of the cancers detected mammographically in this trial to be equivalent to
those of other trials.<Reference refidx="14"/>  This trial and NBSS-2 differ from the other RCTs in
