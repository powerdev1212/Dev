For example, truncating germline mutations in the transmembrane-encoding gene <GeneName>TMEM127</GeneName> on chromosome 2q11 have been shown to be present in approximately 30% of affected patients with familial disease and in about 3% of patients with apparently sporadic pheochromocytomas without a known genetic cause.<Reference refidx="18"/> <GeneName>TMEM127</GeneName> is a negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) effector proteins.</Para><SummarySection id="_159"><Title>Genetic counseling and testing</Title><Para id="_75">It has been proposed that all patients diagnosed with a pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma should consider genetic testing because the incidence of a hereditary syndrome in apparently sporadic cases is as high as 25%.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="19"/> Early identification of a hereditary syndrome allows for early screening for other associated tumors and identification of family members who are at risk. In addition, some patients with a hereditary syndrome are more likely to develop multifocal, malignant, or recurrent disease. Knowledge of the specific genetic mutation permits increased vigilance during preoperative localization or postoperative surveillance of such patients.</Para><Para id="_76">Certain subgroups of patients are at very low risk of having an inherited syndrome (e.g., &lt;2% in patients diagnosed with apparently sporadic pheochromocytoma after age 50 years).<Reference refidx="8"/> Therefore, genetic testing for all patients diagnosed with a pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma may not be practical or cost effective from a population standpoint. It is currently recommended that every patient diagnosed with a pheochromocytoma or extra-adrenal paraganglioma should first undergo risk evaluation for a hereditary syndrome by a certified genetic counselor.

Hypertensive crisis can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and even death.</Para><Para id="_162">Patients are often very symptomatic from excess catecholamine secretion.

In addition, approximately half of patients with pheochromocytoma are asymptomatic because their neoplasms are discovered in the presymptomatic state by either abdominal imaging for other reasons (e.g., adrenal incidentalomas) or genetic testing in at-risk family members.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_45"><Title>Diagnostics</Title><Para id="_164">The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is usually suspected by the presence of an adrenal mass or a workup. Biochemical testing is done to document excess catecholamine secretion. Once the biochemical diagnosis of a catecholamine-secreting tumor is confirmed, localization studies should be performed. Controversy exists as to the optimal single test to make the diagnosis.</Para><SummarySection id="_165"><Title>Biochemical testing</Title><SummarySection id="_90"><Title>24-hour urine collection</Title><Para id="_91">A 24-hour urine collection for catecholamines (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) and fractionated metanephrines (e.g., metanephrine and normetanephrine) has a relatively low sensitivity (77%–90%) but a high specificity (98%). Pretest probability is also important.

Measurement of plasma-free metanephrines (e.g., metanephrine and normetanephrine) has a high sensitivity (97%–99%) but a relatively low specificity (85%).</Para><Para id="_51">In general, it is reasonable to use measurement of plasma-free fractionated metanephrines for initial case detection, which is followed by 24-hour measurement of urine-fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines for confirmation. Test results can be difficult to interpret because of the possibility of false-positive results.

Patients with symptomatic pheochromocytoma almost always have increases in catecholamines or metanephrines two to three times higher than the upper limits of reference ranges.<Reference refidx="20"/> </Para><Para id="_166">Provocative testing (e.g., using glucagon) can be dangerous, adds no value to other current testing methods, and is not recommended.<Reference refidx="28"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_94"><Title>Imaging studies</Title><Para id="_81">Computed tomography (CT) imaging or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis (at least through the level of the aortic bifurcation) are the most commonly used methods for localization.<Reference refidx="29"/> Both have similar sensitivities (90%–100%) and specificities (70%–80%).<Reference refidx="29"/> CT imaging provides superior anatomic detail compared with MRI.</Para><Para id="_83">Additional functional imaging may be necessary if CT imaging or MRI fails to localize the tumor.

Alpha-adrenergic blockade should be initiated at the time of diagnosis and maximized preoperatively to prevent potentially life-threatening cardiovascular complications, which can occur as a result of excess catecholamine secretion during surgery.

During alpha-adrenergic blockade, liberal salt and fluid intake should be encouraged because volume loading reduces excessive orthostatic hypotension both preoperatively and postoperatively. If tachycardia develops or if blood pressure control is not optimal with alpha-adrenergic blockade, a beta-adrenergic blocker (e.g., metoprolol or propranolol) can be added but only after alpha-blockade. Beta-adrenergic blockade must never be initiated before alpha-adrenergic blockade; doing so blocks beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasodilation and results in unopposed alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasoconstriction, which can lead to a life-threatening crisis.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="7094503">Cubeddu LX, Zarate NA, Rosales CB, et al.: Prazosin and propranolol in preoperative management of pheochromocytoma.
