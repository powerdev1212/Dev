cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team
of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during
childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach is particularly important in the management of retinoblastoma; it incorporates the skills
of the following health care professionals and others to ensure that children
receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation that will achieve
optimal survival and quality of life:   </Para><ItemizedList id="_635" Style="bullet"><ListItem>An ophthalmologist with extensive experience in the treatment of children with retinoblastoma.

and their role in the treatment of pediatric patients with cancer have been
outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics.<Reference refidx="2"/>  At these pediatric cancer
centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer
that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity to participate in
these trials is offered to most patients and their families.  Clinical trials for
children and adolescents with cancer are generally designed to compare
potentially better therapy with therapy that is currently accepted as standard. 
Most of the progress made in identifying curative therapies for
childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.  Information about
ongoing clinical trials is available from the <ExternalRef xref="http://cancer.gov/clinicaltrials">NCI Web site.</ExternalRef></Para><Para id="_160">Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> Between 1975 and 2010, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/>  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close follow-up because cancer therapy side effects may persist or develop months or years after treatment.

Treatment of retinoblastoma aims to save the patient's life and preserve useful vision, and thus, needs to be individualized. The management of intraocular retinoblastoma has evolved to a more risk-adapted approach that aims at minimizing systemic exposure to drugs, optimizing ocular drug delivery, and preserving useful vision.</Para><SummarySection id="_486"><Title>Incidence</Title><Para id="_487">Retinoblastoma is a relatively uncommon tumor of childhood that arises in the
retina and accounts for about 3% of the cancers occurring in children younger
than 15 years. </Para><Para id="_730">Retinoblastoma is a cancer of the very young child; two-thirds of all cases of retinoblastoma are diagnosed before age 2 years, and 95% of cases are diagnosed before age 5 years.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Thus, while the estimated annual incidence in the United States is approximately four cases per 1 million children younger than 15 years, the age-adjusted annual incidence in children aged 0 to 4 years is 10 to 14 cases per 1 million (approximately one in 14,000–18,000 live births).</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_716"><Title>Anatomy</Title><Para id="_717">Retinoblastoma arises from the retina, and its growth is usually under the retina and toward the vitreous. Involvement of the ocular coats and optic nerve occurs as a sequence of events as the tumor progresses. Invasion of the choroid is common, although occurrence of massive invasion is usually limited to advanced disease. Following invasion of the choroid, the tumor gains access to systemic circulation and creates the potential for metastases. Further progression through the ocular coats leads to invasion of the sclera and the orbit. Progression through the optic nerve and past the lamina cribrosa increases the risk of systemic and central nervous system (CNS) dissemination. Anteriorly, tumor invading the anterior chamber may gain access to systemic circulation through the canal of Schlemm.</Para><Para id="_727"><MediaLink ref="CDR0000765179" type="image/jpeg" alt="Anatomy of the eye; two-panel drawing showing the outside and inside of the eye.

Most cases present with leukocoria, which is occasionally first noticed after a flash photograph is taken. Strabismus is the second most common presenting sign and usually correlates with macular involvement. Very advanced intraocular tumors present with pain, glaucoma, or buphthalmos. As the tumor progresses, patients may present with orbital or metastatic disease. Metastases occur in the CNS or  systemically (commonly in the bones, bone marrow, and liver).</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_720"><Title>Diagnostic Evaluation</Title><Para id="_721">The diagnosis of intraocular retinoblastoma is usually made without pathologic confirmation. An examination under anesthesia with a maximally dilated pupil and scleral indentation is required to examine the entire retina. A very detailed documentation of the number, location, and size of tumors, the presence of retinal detachment and subretinal fluid, and the presence of subretinal and vitreous seeds must be performed. Additional imaging studies include bidimensional ocular ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (preferred over computed tomography [CT] to avoid radiation exposure). These imaging studies are important to evaluate extraocular extension and to differentiate retinoblastoma from other causes of leukocoria. </Para><Para id="_731">Evaluation of the presence of metastatic disease also needs to be considered in the subgroup of patients with suspected extraocular extension by imaging or high-risk pathology in the enucleated eye (i.e., massive choroidal invasion or involvement of the sclera or the optic nerve beyond the lamina cribrosa). In these cases, bone scintigraphy, bone marrow aspirates and biopsies, and lumbar puncture are performed. </Para><Para id="_732">Genetic counseling is recommended for all patients with retinoblastoma.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_488"><Title>Heritable and Nonheritable Forms of Retinoblastoma</Title><Para id="_489">Retinoblastoma is a tumor that occurs in heritable (25%–30%) and nonheritable (70%–75%) forms. Heritable disease is defined by the presence of a germline mutation of the <GeneName>RB1</GeneName> gene. This germline mutation may have been inherited from an affected progenitor (25% of cases) or may have occurred in utero at the time of conception in patients with sporadic disease (75% of cases). The presence of positive family history or bilateral or multifocal disease is suggestive of heritable disease. </Para><Para id="_643">Heritable retinoblastoma may manifest as  unilateral or bilateral
disease. The penetrance of the <GeneName>RB1</GeneName> mutation (laterality, age at diagnosis, and number of tumors) is probably dependent on concurrent genetic modifiers such as <GeneName>MDM2</GeneName> and <GeneName>MDM4</GeneName>.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/>  All children with bilateral disease 
 and approximately 15% of patients with unilateral disease are presumed to have the   heritable form, even though only 25% have an affected parent.</Para><Para id="_644">In heritable retinoblastoma, tumors tend to be diagnosed at a younger age than  in the nonheritable form of the disease. 
Unilateral retinoblastoma in children younger than 1 year raises concern for heritable disease,
whereas older children with a unilateral tumor are more likely to have  the nonheritable form of the disease.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_528"><Title>Postdiagnosis Surveillance</Title><Para id="_529">Children with a germline <GeneName>RB1</GeneName> mutation may continue to develop new tumors for a few years after diagnosis and treatment; for this reason, they need to be examined frequently. It is common practice for examinations to occur every 2 to 4 months for at least 28 months.<Reference refidx="9"/> The interval between exams is based on the stability of the disease and age of the child (i.e., less frequent visits as the child ages).</Para><Para id="_645">A proportion of children who present with unilateral retinoblastoma will eventually develop disease in the opposite eye. Periodic examinations of the unaffected eye are performed until the germline status of the <GeneName>RB1</GeneName> gene is determined.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_646"><Title>Genetic Testing and Counseling</Title><Para id="_647">Blood and tumor samples can be tested to determine if a patient with retinoblastoma has a mutation in the <GeneName>RB1</GeneName> gene. Once the patient's genetic mutation has been identified, other family members can be screened directly for the mutation. The <GeneName>RB1</GeneName> gene is located within the q14 band of chromosome 13. Exon by exon sequencing of the <GeneName>RB1</GeneName> gene demonstrates germline mutation in 90% of patients with heritable retinoblastoma.<Reference refidx="10"/> </Para><Para id="_648">Although a positive finding with current technology confirms susceptibility, a negative finding cannot absolutely rule it out.<Reference refidx="11"/> A multistep assay that includes the following may be performed for a complete genetic evaluation of the <GeneName>RB1</GeneName> gene:<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_751" Style="bullet"><ListItem>DNA sequencing to identify mutations within coding exons and immediate flanking intronic regions.</ListItem><ListItem>Southern blot analysis to characterize genomic rearrangements.</ListItem><ListItem>Transcript analysis to characterize potential splicing mutations buried within introns.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_752">In cases of somatic mosaicism or cytogenetic abnormalities, the mutations may not be easily detected, and more exhaustive techniques such as karyotyping, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, fluorescence <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> hybridization, and methylation analysis of the <GeneName>RB1</GeneName> promoter may be needed. </Para><Para id="_649">The absence of detectable <GeneName>RB1</GeneName> mutations in some patients suggests that alternative genetic mechanisms may underlie the development of retinoblastoma.<Reference refidx="12"/> Approximately 3% of unilateral, nonheritable retinoblastoma cases have no somatic <GeneName>RB1</GeneName> alterations.  In half of these cases, high levels of <GeneName>MYCN</GeneName> amplification have been reported; these patients had distinct, aggressive, histologic features and a median age at diagnosis of 4 months.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para><Para id="_650">Genetic counseling is an integral part of the management of patients with retinoblastoma and their families, regardless of clinical presentation;  counseling assists  parents in understanding the genetic consequences of each form of retinoblastoma and in estimating the risk of disease in family members.<Reference refidx="10"/> Genetic counseling, however, is not always straightforward. Approximately 10% of children with retinoblastoma have somatic genetic mosaicism, which contributes to the difficulty of genetic counseling.<Reference refidx="14"/> (Refer to the PDQ summaries on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062865" url="/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/risk-assessment-pdq">Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling</SummaryRef> and <SummaryRef href="CDR0000517309" url="/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/overview-pdq">Cancer Genetics Overview</SummaryRef> for more information.)</Para><Para id="_733">Because of the poor prognosis of trilateral retinoblastoma, screening with neuroimaging until age 5 years  is a common practice in the follow-up of children with the heritable form of the disease. (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062846#_496" url="/types/retinoblastoma/hp/retinoblastoma-treatment-pdq">Trilateral retinoblastoma</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information.)   </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_493"><Title>Retinoblastoma-Related Mortality</Title><Para id="_508">While retinoblastoma is a highly curable disease, the challenge for those who treat retinoblastoma is to preserve life and to prevent the loss of an eye, blindness, and other serious effects of treatment that reduce the patient's life span or the quality of life. With improvements in the diagnosis and management of retinoblastoma over the past several decades, metastatic retinoblastoma is observed less frequently in the United States and other developed nations. As a result, other causes of retinoblastoma-related mortality in the first and subsequent decades of life, such as   trilateral retinoblastoma and subsequent neoplasms (SNs), have become significant contributors to retinoblastoma-related mortality. Death from an SN is the most common cause of death and contributes to more than 50% of deaths for patients with bilateral disease.<Reference refidx="15"/> In the United States, before the advent of chemoreduction as a means of treating heritable or bilateral disease, trilateral retinoblastoma contributed to more than 50% of retinoblastoma-related mortality in the first decade after diagnosis.<Reference refidx="16"/></Para><SummarySection id="_496"><Title>Trilateral retinoblastoma</Title><Para id="_497">Trilateral retinoblastoma is a well-recognized syndrome that occurs in 5% to 15% of patients with heritable retinoblastoma and is defined by the development of an intracranial
midline neuroblastic tumor, which typically develops between the ages of 20 and 36 months.<Reference refidx="17"/>   </Para><Para id="_498">Given the poor prognosis of trilateral retinoblastoma and the short interval between the diagnosis of retinoblastoma and the occurrence of trilateral disease, routine neuroimaging could potentially detect most cases within 2 years of first diagnosis. Although it is not clear whether early diagnosis can impact survival, screening with MRI has been recommended as often as every 6 months for 5 years for those suspected of having heritable disease or those with unilateral disease and a positive family history.<Reference refidx="17"/> CT scans are generally avoided for routine screening in these children because of the perceived risk of exposure  to ionizing radiation. At the time of diagnosis, patients who are
asymptomatic of an intracranial tumor have a better
outcome than do patients who are symptomatic.<Reference refidx="17"/></Para><Para id="_652">Approximately 5% to 10% of children with heritable retinoblastoma develop pineal gland cysts detected by MRI; these cyst abnormalities must be distinguished from the pineoblastoma that typically defines trilateral retinoblastoma.<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_499"><Title>Subsequent neoplasms (SNs)</Title><Para id="_653">Survivors of retinoblastoma have a high risk of developing SNs.

A marked increase in mortality from lung, bladder, and other epithelial cancers has been described.<Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/> Among retinoblastoma survivors with heritable retinoblastoma, those with an inherited germline mutation are at a slightly higher risk of an SN than are those with a de novo mutation; this increase appears to be most significant for melanoma.<Reference refidx="25"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Past treatment for retinoblastoma with radiation therapy.</Strong> The cumulative incidence of SNs was reported to be 26% (± 10%) in nonirradiated patients and 58% (± 10%) in irradiated patients by 50

The carcinogenic effect of radiation therapy is associated with the dose delivered, particularly for subsequent sarcomas, and a step-wise increase is apparent at all dose categories.

Microscopically, the appearance of retinoblastoma depends on the degree of differentiation. Undifferentiated retinoblastoma is composed of small, round, densely packed cells with hypochromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Several degrees of photoreceptor differentiation have been described and are characterized by distinctive arrangements of tumor cells. The Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes are specific for retinoblastoma; these structures consist of a cluster of low, columnar cells arranged around a central lumen that is bounded by an eosinophilic membrane analogous to the external membrane of the normal retina. The lumen contains an acid mucopolysaccharide similar to that found around normal rods and cones. These rosettes are seen in 70% of tumors. Homer-Wright rosettes, on the other hand,  are composed of irregular circlets of tumor cells arranged around a tangle of fibrils with no lumen or internal-limiting membrane. Horner-Wright rosettes are infrequently seen in retinoblastoma and are most often seen in other neuroblastic tumors, such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma.

are characterized by marked cell proliferation, as evidenced by high mitosis

Routine baseline brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended at diagnosis because it may detect trilateral retinoblastoma at a subclinical stage.  In a small series of patients, the 5-year overall survival was 67% for those detected at baseline, compared with 11% for the group with a delayed diagnosis.<Reference refidx="5"/> The value of screening with MRI for those suspected of having heritable disease or those with unilateral disease and a positive family history is not determined. MRI screening may be needed as often as every 6 months until the child is age 5 years. Given the short interval between the diagnosis of retinoblastoma and the occurrence of trilateral retinoblastoma, routine screening might detect most cases within 2 years.
