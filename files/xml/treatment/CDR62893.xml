They occur most frequently in tissues derived from the embryonic gut. Foregut tumors, which account for up to 25% of cases, arise in the lung, thymus, stomach, or proximal duodenum. Midgut tumors, which account for up to 50% of cases, arise in the small intestine, appendix, or proximal colon. Hindgut tumors, which account for approximately 15% of cases, arise in the distal colon or rectum.<Reference refidx="4"/> Other sites of origin include the gallbladder, kidney, liver, pancreas, ovary, and testis.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>   </Para><Para id="_223">GI carcinoid tumors, especially tumors of the small intestine, are often associated with other cancers. Synchronous or metachronous cancers occur in approximately 29% of patients with small intestinal carcinoids.<Reference refidx="3"/> However, it is possible that the association may be due in part to the serendipitous discovery of slow-growing carcinoid tumors, which are found while staging or  investigating symptoms from other tumors. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_12"><Title>Histology</Title><Para id="_13">The term <Emphasis>carcinoid</Emphasis> should be used for well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) or carcinomas of the GI tract only; the term should not be used to describe pancreatic NETs or islet cell tumors.<Reference refidx="6"/> (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062794" url="/types/pancreatic/hp/pnet-treatment-pdq">Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (Islet Cell Tumors)</SummaryRef> for more information.) Data regarding carcinoids and other NETs, such as poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas, may be combined in some epidemiologic and clinical studies, rendering separate consideration difficult.

Although the cellular origin of NETs of the GI tract is uncertain, consistent expression of cytokeratins in NETs and the expression of the caudal-related homeodomain protein 2 (CdX2 protein), an intestinal transcription factor in endocrine tumors of the small intestine, suggests an origin from an epithelial precursor cell.<Reference refidx="8"/> </Para><Para id="_71">Most NETs of the small and large intestines occur sporadically, while others may occur within the background of an inherited neoplasia syndrome such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) or neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) (e.g., gastrin-producing G-cell tumors and somatostatin-producing D-cell tumors of the duodenum, respectively).<Reference refidx="9"/> Tumor multifocality is the rule within the background of neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia, but multifocality is found in approximately one-third of patients with small enterochromaffin cell tumors in the absence of proliferative or genetic factors; clonality studies suggest that most of these neoplasms are separate primary lesions.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/> Gastric carcinoids may be associated with chronic atrophic gastritis.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><SummarySection id="_320"><Title>Histopathology</Title><Para id="_138">Individual carcinoid tumors have specific histologic and immunohistochemical features based on their anatomic location and endocrine cell type.

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_40"><Title>Jejunal and ileal carcinoids</Title><Para id="_147">Most jejunal and ileal carcinoids are argentaffin-positive, substance P–containing, and serotonin-producing EC-cell tumors that generate carcinoid syndrome when hepatic or retroperitoneal nodal metastases are present. L-cell, glucagon-like polypeptide-producing, and
pancreatic polypeptide- and polypeptide YY-producing tumors occur less frequently.<Reference refidx="24"/> Ileal carcinoids develop preferentially in the 
terminal ileum.<Reference refidx="12"/> Jejunal and ileal carcinoids occur equally in men and women at a mean age of 65.4 years.<Reference refidx="3"/> Similar to all carcinoids, jejunal and ileal carcinoids vary in their biologic behavior and ability to metastasize. Typically, EC-cell carcinoids of the small intestine metastasize to lymph nodes and the liver.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Patients with these lesions may be asymptomatic. The primary tumor may cause small intestinal obstruction, ischemia, or bleeding, and some patients may complain of a long history of intermittent crampy abdominal pain, weight loss, fatigue, abdominal distention, diarrhea, or nausea and vomiting.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="35"/></Para><Para id="_148">At the time of diagnosis, ileal NETs (i.e., carcinoids plus poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas) are commonly larger than 2 cm and have metastasized to regional lymph nodes; in as many as  40% of cases, the tumors are multifocal.<Reference refidx="12"/> Immunocytochemically, the cells contain serotonin, substance P, kallikrein, and catecholamine. Approximately 20% of patients with ileal NETs have regional lymph node and liver metastases. Most GI carcinoids secrete their bioactive peptides and amines into the portal circulation, and the effects of these biochemical mediators are diminished or negated by hepatic detoxification; accordingly, carcinoid syndrome (e.g., flush, diarrhea, and endocardial fibrosis) occurs only in patients with liver metastases because hepatic detoxification of serotonin is bypassed.

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_43"><Title>Appendiceal carcinoids</Title><Para id="_44">Most appendiceal carcinoids are serotonin-producing EC-cell tumors similar to carcinoids that occur in the jejunum and ileum; less commonly, appendiceal carcinoids are L-cell tumors similar to those in the colon.<Reference refidx="16"/> The biologic behavior of both cell types is strikingly different in the appendix compared with tumors of the ileum and nonappendiceal colon. Most appendiceal carcinoids have a benign clinical course and do not metastasize, perhaps because growth in the appendix produces obstruction, appendicitis, and subsequent surgical removal.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="36"/> Although appendiceal carcinoids occur in patients of all ages, patients with these tumors tend to be much younger than  patients diagnosed with other appendiceal neoplasms or carcinoids at other sites. Appendiceal carcinoids are reportedly more common in female patients.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="5"/> However, age and gender patterns may be spurious, reflecting  the younger age range of patients who typically undergo appendectomy for inflammatory appendicitis, and the larger number of incidental appendectomies performed in women during pelvic operations. 

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_45"><Title>Colorectal carcinoids</Title><Para id="_46">Most colorectal carcinoids occur in the rectum; fewer arise in the cecum.<Reference refidx="5"/> In the cecum, argentaffin-like EC-cell carcinoids are most common, become increasingly less common in the more distal colon, and are uncommon in the rectum.<Reference refidx="31"/> Rectal carcinoids account for approximately one-fourth of GI carcinoids and fewer than 1% of all rectal cancers.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="31"/> Most rectal carcinoids have L-cell differentiation. The mean age of patients at diagnosis for colonic carcinoids is 66 years and for rectal carcinoids, 56.2 years. Although there is no specific gender predilection for colorectal carcinoids,  rectal carcinoids are more common in the black population.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="37"/>  Abdominal pain and weight loss are typical symptoms of colonic carcinoids, but more than 50% of patients with rectal carcinoids are asymptomatic, and the tumors are discovered at routine rectal examination or screening endoscopy.<Reference refidx="24"/> Symptoms of rectal carcinoids include bleeding, pain, and constipation. Metastatic disease from colonic carcinoids may produce carcinoid syndrome, whereas metastatic disease from rectal carcinoids is not associated with carcinoid syndrome.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="38"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_16"><Title>Diagnostics: Biochemical Markers, Imaging, and Approach</Title><SummarySection id="_47"><Title>Biochemical markers</Title><Para id="_48">Biochemical investigations in the diagnosis of GI carcinoids include the use of 24-hour urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) collection, which has a specificity of approximately 88%, although the sensitivity is reported to be as low as 35%.<Reference refidx="39"/><Reference refidx="40"/><Reference refidx="41"/> A  time-consuming test, 5-HIAA requires dietary avoidance of serotonin-rich foods, such as bananas, tomatoes, and eggplant.<Reference refidx="42"/> Measurement of plasma chromogranin A (CgA), first described in a study of adrenal gland secretions in 1967 as one of the soluble protein fractions (also including CgB and CgC) of chromaffin granules, is also useful.<Reference refidx="43"/> Although plasma levels of CgA are very sensitive markers of carcinoids, they are nonspecific because they are also elevated in other types of NETs, such as pancreatic and small cell lung carcinomas.<Reference refidx="44"/><Reference refidx="45"/><Reference refidx="46"/> Plasma CgA appears to be a better biochemical marker of carcinoids than does urinary 5-HIAA.<Reference refidx="47"/> Numerous investigations have revealed an association between plasma CgA levels and disease severity.<Reference refidx="26"/> However, false-positive plasma levels of CgA may occur in patients on proton pump inhibitors, reported to occur even with short-term, low-dose treatment.<Reference refidx="48"/><Reference refidx="49"/> Many other biochemical markers are associated with NETs—including substance P, neurotensin, bradykinin, human chorionic gonadotropin, neuropeptide L, and pancreatic polypeptide—but none match the specificity or predictive value of 5-HIAA or CgA.<Reference refidx="44"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_49"><Title>Imaging</Title><Para id="_50">Imaging modalities for GI carcinoids include the use of somatostatin scintigraphy with 111Indium-octreotide; bone scintigraphy with 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate (99mTcMDP); 123 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy; computed tomography (CT); capsule endoscopy (CE); enteroscopy; and angiography.<Reference refidx="26"/> </Para><SummarySection id="_51"><Title>Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy </Title><Para id="_52">There are five different somatostatin receptor  (SSTR) subtypes; more than  70% of NETs of both the GI tract and pancreas express multiple subtypes, with a predominance of receptor subtype 2 [sst(2)] and receptor subtype 5 [sst(5)].<Reference refidx="50"/><Reference refidx="51"/> The synthetic radiolabeled SSTR analog  111In-DTP-d-Phe10-{octreotide} affords an important method, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS), to localize carcinoid tumors, especially sst(2)-positive and sst(5)-positive tumors; imaging is accomplished in one session, and small primary tumors and metastases are diagnosed more readily than with conventional imaging or imaging techniques requiring multiple sessions.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="52"/><Reference refidx="53"/> Overall sensitivity of the octreotide scan is reported to be as high as 90%; however, failed detection may result from  various technical issues, small tumor size, or inadequate expression of SSTRs.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="54"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_53"><Title>Bone scintigraphy</Title><Para id="_54">Bone scintigraphy with 99mTcMDP is the primary imaging modality for identifying bone involvement in NETs and detection rates are reported to be 90% or higher.<Reference refidx="26"/> 123I-MIBG is concentrated by carcinoid tumors in as many as  70% of cases using the same mechanism as norepinephrine and is used successfully to visualize carcinoids; however, 123I-MIBG appears to be about half as sensitive as 111In-octreotide scintigraphy in detecting tumors.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="55"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_55"><Title>CT/MRI</Title><Para id="_56">CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are important modalities used in the initial localization of carcinoid primaries and/or metastases.

If the condition of the patient is such that surgery is not a greater risk than the disease, the primary tumor should be resected to prevent an emergency presentation with obstruction, perforation, or bleeding.<Reference refidx="1"/> Despite common acceptance  that resection of at least 90% of the tumor burden is required to achieve palliation, approximately 60% of patients with surgery alone will experience symptom recurrence; the 5-year survival rate is between 35% and 80%, depending on the experience of the surgical center.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/> Because treatment with somatostatin analogs can achieve similar rates of symptom relief with fewer adverse effects, in each patient the benefits of surgical treatment of gastrointestinal (GI) carcinoid tumors should be weighed carefully against the potential risks of an open exploration.
