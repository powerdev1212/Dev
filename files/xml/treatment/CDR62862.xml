Compared to surgery to remove the whole breast, surgery to save or reconstruct the breast seems to have little effect on sexual function (including how often women have sex, the ease of reaching <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000476622">orgasm</GlossaryTermRef>, or overall sexual satisfaction). Women who have surgery to save the breast are more likely to continue to enjoy breast caressing.

Nerves can be damaged when their <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000270735">blood</GlossaryTermRef> supply is affected or when the nerves are cut.

Recovery of erectile function usually happens within a year after having a radical prostatectomy. However, recovery of erectile function after <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044971">radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef> is slow and happens over two or three years. <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045151">Brachytherapy</GlossaryTermRef> (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046345">internal radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef> using <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046550">radioactive</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000285636">implants</GlossaryTermRef>) is being used more often to treat prostate cancer.

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/espanol/recursos/pdq">Spanish</ExternalRef>.</Para><Para id="_AboutThis_4">PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_AboutThis_5"><Title>Purpose of This Summary</Title><Para id="_AboutThis_6">This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about sexuality and reproductive issues that cancer patients may experience during or after treatment.

These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Date Last Modified") is the date of the most recent change.

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_AboutThis_10"><Title>Clinical Trial Information</Title><Para id="_AboutThis_11">A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
</Para><Para id="_AboutThis_12">Clinical trials are listed in PDQ and can be found online at <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials">NCI's Web site</ExternalRef>.
