cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team
of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during
childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the primary care physician, pediatric surgical subspecialists, radiation
oncologists, pediatric medical oncologists/hematologists, rehabilitation
specialists, pediatric nurse specialists, social workers, and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
that will achieve optimal survival and quality of life.  (Refer to the PDQ <ExternalRef xref="http://cancer.gov/cancerinfo/pdq/supportivecare/">Supportive and Palliative Care</ExternalRef> summaries for specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer.)</Para><Para id="_644">Guidelines for
pediatric cancer centers and their role in the treatment of pediatric patients
with cancer have been outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics.<Reference refidx="2"/>  At
these pediatric cancer centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity
to participate in these trials is offered to most patients/families.  Clinical
trials for children and adolescents diagnosed with cancer are generally
designed to compare potentially better therapy with therapy that is currently
accepted as standard.  Most of the progress made in identifying curative
therapy for childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.
Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the <ExternalRef xref="http://cancer.gov/clinicaltrials">NCI 
Web site</ExternalRef>.</Para><Para id="_645">Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2010, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close follow-up because cancer therapy side effects may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000343584" url="/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq">Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer</SummaryRef> for specific information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors.)</Para><Para id="_646">Childhood cancer is a rare disease with less than 13,000 cases diagnosed before the age of 20 years each year in the United States.<Reference refidx="4"/> The <ExternalRef xref="http://history.nih.gov/research/downloads/PL107-280.pdf">Rare Disease Act of 2002</ExternalRef> defines a rare disease as one that affects populations smaller than 200,000 persons in the United States and thus, by definition, all pediatric cancers would be considered rare. The designation of a pediatric rare tumor is not uniform; for example, the Italian cooperative project on rare pediatric tumors (Tumori Rari in Eta Pediatrica [TREP]) defines a pediatric rare tumor as one with an incidence of less than two per 1 million population per year and is not the subject of specific clinical trials.<Reference refidx="5"/> Yet, this definition excludes common histologic subtypes such as melanoma and thyroid carcinoma, both of which have an incidence rate in excess of five per 1 million per year.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_648">Most diagnoses included in this summary of rare cancers are in the subset of malignancies listed in the International Classification of Childhood Cancer (ICCC) subgroup XI, including thyroid cancer, melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers, in addition to multiple types of carcinomas (e.g., adrenocortical carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and most adult-type carcinomas such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, etc.).  These diagnoses account for about 4% of cancers diagnosed in children aged 0 to 14 years, compared with about 20% of cancers diagnosed for adolescents aged 15 to 19 years (see Figure 1). The majority of cancers within subgroup XI are either melanomas or thyroid cancer, with the remaining subgroup XI cancer types accounting for only 1.3% of cancers in children aged 0 to 14 years and 5.3% of cancers within adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.  The very low incidence of patients with any individual diagnosis, and their age distribution, makes these rare cancers extremely challenging to study.</Para><Para id="_732"><MediaLink ref="CDR0000732714" type="image/jpeg" alt="Age-adjusted and age-specific cancer incidence rates for patients 0-19 years of age (SEER 2005-2009); chart shows leukemia, lymphoma, central nervous system (CNS) tumors, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, renal tumors, hepatic tumors, bone tumors, soft tissue tumors, germ cell tumors, carcinomas and melanomas, and other cancer incidence by percent." language="en" thumb="Yes" id="_731" size="three-quarters"><Caption language="en">Figure 1.

The Gesellschaft für Pädiatrische Onkologie und Hämatologie  (GPOH) rare tumor project was founded in Germany in 2006.<Reference refidx="7"/> The TREP project was launched in Italy in 2000,<Reference refidx="5"/> and the Polish Pediatric Rare Tumor Study Group was launched in 2002.<Reference refidx="8"/> Within the COG, efforts have concentrated on increasing accrual to the COG registry and the rare tumor bank and developing single-arm clinical trials and increasing cooperation with adult cooperative group trials. The accomplishments and challenges of this initiative are described in detail.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_650">The tumors discussed in this summary are very diverse; they are arranged in
descending anatomic order, from infrequent tumors of the head and neck to rare
tumors of the urogenital tract and skin.  All of these cancers are rare enough
that most pediatric hospitals might see less than a handful of some histologies in several years. The majority of the histologies described here occur more frequently in adults.  Information about these tumors may also be found in sources relevant to
adults with cancer.

Unusual pediatric head and neck cancers include nasopharyngeal carcinoma, esthesioneuroblastoma, thyroid tumors, 
 oral cancer, salivary gland cancer,  laryngeal carcinoma, papillomatosis, and respiratory tract carcinoma involving the <GeneName>NUT</GeneName> gene on chromosome 15.<Reference refidx="1"/>  The prognosis,
diagnosis, classification, and treatment of these head and neck cancers are
discussed below.
 It must be emphasized that these cancers are seen very infrequently in patients younger than 15 years, and most of the evidence is derived from case series. </Para><SummarySection id="_107"><Title>Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</Title><SummarySection id="_905"><Title>Incidence</Title><Para id="_906">Nasopharyngeal carcinoma arises in the lining of the nasal cavity and pharynx.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> This tumor accounts for about one-third of all cancers of the upper airways. 
 Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is very uncommon in children younger than 10 years but increases in incidence to 0.8 and 1.3 per 1 million per year in children aged 10 to 14 years and in children aged 15 to 19 years, respectively.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/> The incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma is characterized by racial and geographic variations, with an endemic distribution among well-defined ethnic groups, such as inhabitants of some areas in North Africa and Southeast Asia. In the United States, nasopharyngeal carcinoma is overrepresented in black children when compared with other malignancies.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_907"><Title>Risk factor</Title><Para id="_908">Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. In addition to the serological evidence of infection, EBV DNA is present as a monoclonal episome in the nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, and tumor cells can have EBV antigens on their cell surface.<Reference refidx="8"/> The circulating levels of EBV DNA, and serologic documentation of EBV infection, may aid in the diagnosis.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_909"><Title>Histology</Title><Para id="_910">Three histologic subtypes of nasopharyngeal carcinoma are recognized by the World
Health Organization (WHO).  Type 1 is squamous cell carcinoma; type 2 is
nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma; and type 3 is undifferentiated carcinoma. Children with nasopharyngeal carcinoma are more likely to have WHO type 2 or type 3 disease.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_911"><Title>Clinical presentation</Title><Para id="_912">Nasopharyngeal carcinoma commonly presents as nosebleeds, nasal congestion and obstruction, or otitis media.<Reference refidx="4"/> Given the rich lymphatic drainage of the nasopharynx, bilateral cervical lymphadenopathies are often the first sign of disease. The tumor spreads locally to adjacent areas of the oropharynx and may invade the skull base, resulting in cranial nerve palsy or difficulty with movements of the jaw (trismus). Distant metastatic sites may include the bones, lungs,
and liver.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_913"><Title>Diagnostic evaluation</Title><Para id="_914">Diagnostic tests should determine the extent of the primary tumor and whether
there are metastases.  Visualization of the nasopharynx by an ear-nose-throat
specialist using nasal endoscopy, examination by a neurologist, and magnetic resonance
imaging of the head and neck can be used to determine the extent of the
primary tumor.  A diagnosis can be made from a biopsy of the
primary tumor or of enlarged lymph nodes of the neck.  Nasopharyngeal carcinomas must be distinguished from all other cancers that can present with
enlarged lymph nodes and from other types of cancer in the head and neck area. 
Thus, diseases such as thyroid cancer, rhabdomyosarcoma, non-Hodgkin
lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and Burkitt lymphoma must be considered, as
should benign conditions such as nasal angiofibroma, which usually presents with
epistaxis in adolescent males, and infectious lymphadenitis. Evaluation of the chest and abdomen by computed tomography and bone scan should also be performed to determine whether there is metastatic
disease.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_915"><Title>Staging</Title><Para id="_916"><ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/nasopharyngeal/HealthProfessional/page3">Tumor staging</ExternalRef> is  performed utilizing the tumor-node-metastasis classification system

The incidence of adrenocortical tumors is particularly high in southern Brazil, where it is approximately 10 to 15 times that observed in the United States.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/> Childhood adrenocortical tumors typically present during the first 5 years of life (median age, 3–4 years), although there is a second, smaller peak during adolescence.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/>  Female gender is consistently predominant in most studies, with a female to male ratio of 1.6 to 1.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_812"><Title>Risk factors</Title><Para id="_813">Predisposing genetic factors have been implicated in more than 50% of the cases in North America and Europe, and in 95% of the Brazilian cases. Germline <GeneName>TP53</GeneName> mutations are almost always the predisposing factor. The likelihood of a <GeneName>TP53</GeneName> germline mutation is highest in the first years of life and diminishes with age.<Reference refidx="14"/> In the non-Brazilian cases, relatives of children with adrenocortical tumors often, although not invariably, have a high incidence of other non-adrenal cancers (Li-Fraumeni syndrome); germline mutations usually occur within the region coding for the <GeneName>TP53</GeneName> DNA-binding domain (exons 5 to 8, primarily at highly conserved amino acid residues).<Reference refidx="7"/> In the Brazilian cases, in contrast, the patients’ families do not exhibit a high incidence of cancer, and a single, unique mutation at codon 337 in exon 10 of the <GeneName>TP53</GeneName> gene is consistently observed.<Reference refidx="15"/> In a Brazilian study, neonatal screening for the <GeneName>TP53 R337H</GeneName>  mutation, which is prevalent in the region, identified 461 (0.27%) carriers among 171,649 of the newborns who were screened.<Reference refidx="16"/>  Carriers and relatives younger than 15 years were offered clinical screening.

In fact, adenoma and carcinoma appear to share multiple genetic aberrations and may represent points on a continuum of cellular transformation.<Reference refidx="21"/> Macroscopically, adenomas tend to be well defined and spherical, and they never invade surrounding structures. They are typically small (usually &lt;200 cm<Superscript>3</Superscript>), and some studies have included size as a criterion for adenoma. By contrast, carcinomas have macroscopic features suggestive of malignancy; they are larger, and they show marked lobulation with extensive areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. Microscopically, carcinomas comprise larger cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, arranged in alveolar clusters.
