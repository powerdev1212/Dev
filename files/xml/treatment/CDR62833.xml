with an estimated 220,800 new cases and 27,540 deaths expected in 2015.<Reference refidx="1"/>   A wide range of
estimates of the impact of the disease are notable.  The disease is
histologically evident in as many as 34% of men in their fifth decade and in up
to 70% of men aged  80 years  and older.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>  Prostate cancer will be
diagnosed in almost one-fifth of U.S. men compared with about 3% of
men who will be expected to die of the disease.<Reference refidx="4"/> The estimated reduction in life
expectancy of men who die of prostate cancer is approximately 9 years.<Reference refidx="5"/> 
</Para><Para id="_12">The extraordinarily high rate of clinically occult prostate cancer in the
general population compared with  the 20-fold lower likelihood of death from the
disease indicates that many of these cancers have low biologic risk. Concordant
with this observation are the many series of patients with lower-risk (i.e., Gleason 6 and some low-volume Gleason 7 tumors)  prostate cancer
managed by surveillance alone with high survival rates at 5 and 10
years of follow-up.<Reference refidx="6"/>  Data demonstrate, however, that with longer follow-up, higher-grade cancers are associated with a greater risk of prostate cancer death.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/>
</Para><Para id="_143">Because of marked variability in tumor differentiation from one microscopic field to another, many pathologists will report the range of differentiation among the malignant cells that are present in a biopsy using the Gleason grading system.  This grading system includes five histologic patterns distinguished by the glandular architecture of the cancer. The architectural patterns are identified and assigned a grade from 1 to 5 with  1 being the most differentiated and 5 being the least differentiated. The sum of the grades of the predominant and next most prevalent  will range from 2 (well-differentiated tumors) to 10 (undifferentiated tumors).<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/>  Systematic changes to the histological interpretation of biopsy specimens by anatomical pathologists have occurred during the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening era (i.e., since about 1985) in the United States.<Reference refidx="11"/> This phenomenon, sometimes called “grade inflation,”      is the apparent increase in the distribution of high-grade tumors in the population for a period of time but in the absence of a true biological or clinical change. It is possibly the result of an increasing tendency for pathologists to read tumor grade as more aggressive,  resulting in a higher preponderance to treat these cancers aggressively.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_13">Treatment options available for prostate cancer include radical prostatectomy,
external-beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, cryotherapy, focal ablation, androgen  deprivation with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs and/or antiandrogens, intermittent androgen deprivation, cytotoxic agents,  and active surveillance.  Of all the means of management, only radical prostatectomy has been tested in a randomized clinical trial to assess survival benefit.  In this study, prostatectomy was found  to be superior to surveillance in men with localized prostate cancer      in terms of reduced rates of metastases (relative hazard [RH] = 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41–0.96) and disease specific (RH = 0.5; 95% CI, 0.27–0.91) and overall mortalities.<Reference refidx="13"/> The relative efficacy of radical prostatectomy to the other forms of treatment has not been adequately addressed.<Reference refidx="14"/>  Confounding issues in the treatment of prostate cancer include side
effects with treatment, inability to predict the natural history of a given
cancer, patient comorbidity that may affect an individual’s likelihood of
surviving long enough to be at risk for disease morbidity and mortality, and an increasing body of evidence suggesting that with careful  PSA monitoring following treatment, a
substantial fraction of patients may suffer disease recurrence .<Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Para id="_14">Because of considerable uncertainty regarding the efficacy of treatment and the
difficulty with selecting patients for whom there is a known risk of disease
progression,  opinion in the medical community is divided regarding
screening for carcinoma of the prostate.  While both digital rectal examination
and PSA screening have demonstrated reasonable performance characteristics (sensitivity,
specificity, and positive predictive value) for the early detection of prostate
cancer, conflicting outcomes of randomized trials examining the impact of screening on mortality has led to some organizations to recommend for and others to recommend against screening.<Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/></Para><Para id="_15">The tremendous impact of prostate cancer on the U.S. population and the
financial burden of the disease for both  patients and society have led to an
increased interest in primary disease prevention.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">American Cancer Society: Cancer Facts and Figures 2015.

with increasing age.  Although it is a very unusual disease in men younger than 50 years, rates
increase exponentially thereafter.  The registration rate by age cohort in
England and Wales increased from eight per thousand population in men aged 50 to 56 years to
68 per thousand in men aged 60 to 64 years; 260 per thousand in men aged 70 to 74 years, and
peaked at 406 per thousand in men aged 75 to 79 years.<Reference refidx="1"/>     In this same population, the death rate per thousand
in 1992 in  cohorts of men aged 50 to 54 years, 60 to 64 years, and 70 to 74 years  was 4, 37, and 166, respectively.<Reference refidx="1"/>  At all ages, incidence of
prostate cancer in blacks exceeds those of whites.<Reference refidx="2"/>

have a first-degree male relative (e.g., brother, father) with prostate cancer,
compared with  approximately 8% of the U.S. population.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Approximately 9% of all prostate cancers may result from heritable
susceptibility genes.<Reference refidx="4"/>  Several authors have completed segregation analyses,
and though a single, rare autosomal gene has been suggested to cause cancer
in some of these families, the burden of evidence suggests that the inheritance
is considerably more complex.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/> 
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_22"><Title>Hormones</Title><Para id="_23">The development of the prostate is dependent upon the secretion of dihydrotestosterone (DHT)
by the fetal testis.  Testosterone causes normal virilization of the Wolffian
duct structures and internal genitalia and is acted upon by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase (5AR) to form DHT.  DHT has a 4-fold to 50-fold greater affinity for the androgen receptor than testosterone, and it is
DHT that leads to normal prostatic development.  Children born with abnormal
5AR (due to a change in a single base pair in exon 5 of the normal type II 5AR
gene), are born with ambiguous genitalia (variously described as hypospadias
with a blind-ending vagina to a small phallus) but masculinize at puberty because of the surge of testosterone production at that time.  Clinical, imaging, and
histologic studies of kindreds born with 5AR deficiency have demonstrated a
small, pancake-appearing prostate with an undetectable prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) level and no evidence of prostatic epithelium.<Reference refidx="8"/>  Long-term follow-up
demonstrates that neither benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) nor prostate
cancer develop.
</Para><Para id="_24">Other evidence suggesting that the degree of cumulative exposure of the
prostate to androgens is related to an increased risk of prostate cancer
includes the following:
</Para><OrderedList id="_76" Style="Arabic" Compact="No"><ListItem>Neither BPH nor prostate cancer have been reported in men castrated         
prior to puberty.<Reference refidx="9"/></ListItem><ListItem>Androgen deprivation in almost all forms leads to involution of the         
prostate, a fall in PSA levels, apoptosis of prostate cancer and            
epithelial cells, and a clinical response in prostate cancer         
patients.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/></ListItem><ListItem>The results of two large-scale chemoprevention trials using 5AR inhibitors (finasteride and dutasteride) demonstrate that intraprostatic androgens modulate prostate cancer risk.  In both studies, reductions in overall prostate cancer risk were identified although with increased risk of high-grade disease.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/></ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_206">Ecological studies have found a correlation between serum levels of testosterone, especially DHT, and overall risk of prostate cancer among African American, white, and Japanese males.<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/>  However, evidence from prospective studies of the association between serum concentrations of sex hormones, including androgens and estrogens, does not support a direct link.<Reference refidx="17"/> A collaborative analysis  of 18 prospective studies, pooling prediagnostic measures on 3,886 men with incident prostate cancer and 6,438 control subjects, found no association between the risk of prostate cancer and serum concentrations of testosterone, calculated-free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone sulfate, androstenedione, androstanediol glucuronide, estradiol, or calculated-free estradiol.<Reference refidx="17"/>   A caution for interpreting the data is the unknown degree of correlation between serum levels and prostate tissue level. Androstanediol glucuronide may most closely reflect intraprostatic androgen activity, and this measure was not associated with the risk of prostate cancer. This lack  of association affirms that risk stratification cannot be made on serum hormone concentrations.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_31"><Title>Race</Title><Para id="_32">The risk of developing and dying from prostate cancer is dramatically higher among blacks, is of

the etiology of these outcomes, but some evidence is available that access to
health care may play a role in disease outcomes.<Reference refidx="20"/>
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_33"><Title>Dietary Fat</Title><Para id="_34">An interesting observation is that although the incidence of latent (occult,
histologically evident) prostate cancer is similar throughout the world,
clinical prostate cancer varies from country to country by as much as 20-fold.<Reference refidx="21"/>  Previous ecologic studies have demonstrated a direct relationship
between a country’s prostate cancer-specific mortality rate and average total
calories from fat consumed by the country’s population.<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/>  Studies of
immigrants from Japan have demonstrated that native Japanese have the lowest
risk of clinical prostate cancer, first generation Japanese-Americans have an
intermediate risk, and subsequent generations have a risk comparable to the
U.S. population.<Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/>  Animal models of explanted human prostate cancer have
demonstrated decreased tumor growth rates in animals who are  fed a low-fat diet.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/> 
Evidence from many case-control studies has found an association
between dietary fat and prostate cancer risk,<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/> though studies have not
uniformly reached this conclusion.<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/>  In a review of published studies of
the relationship between dietary fat and prostate cancer risk, among
descriptive studies, approximately half found an increased risk with increased
dietary fat and half found no association.<Reference refidx="34"/>  Among case-control studies,
 about half of the studies found an increased risk with increasing
dietary fat, animal fat, and saturated and monounsaturated fat intake while
approximately half found no association.  Only in studies of polyunsaturated
fat intake were  three studies reported  of a significant negative association
between prostate cancer and fat intake.  Fat of animal origin seems
to be associated with the highest risk.<Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="35"/>  In a series of 384 patients
with prostate cancer, the risk of cancer progression to an advanced stage was
greater in men with a high fat intake.<Reference refidx="36"/>  The announcement in 1996 that
cancer mortality rates had fallen in the United States prompted the  suggestion
that this may be caused by  decreases in dietary fat intake during the same time
period.<Reference refidx="37"/><Reference refidx="38"/>
</Para><Para id="_266">Two studies were conducted within the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial in which prospective nutritional information was collected and all subjects were recommended to undergo biopsy.  Findings included that, among 9,559 subjects there was no association between any supplement or nutrient (including fat) and risk of prostate cancer overall but the risk of high-grade cancer was associated with high intake of polyunsaturated fats.   In a subset of 1,658 cases and 1,803 controls, specific fatty acids were examined and docosahexaenoic acid was associated with risk of high-grade disease while trans-fatty acids (TFA) 18:1 and TFA 18:2 were inversely associated with risk of high-grade disease.  These large scale studies suggest a complex relationship between nutrients such as fat and risk of prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="39"/><Reference refidx="40"/></Para><Para id="_35">The explanation for this possible association between prostate cancer and
dietary fat is unknown.  Several hypotheses have been advanced, including:
</Para><OrderedList id="_77" Style="Arabic" Compact="No"><ListItem>Dietary fat may increase serum androgen levels, thereby increasing          
prostate cancer risk.  This hypothesis is supported by observations         
from South Africa and the United States that changes in dietary fat         
intake change urinary and serum levels of androgens.<Reference refidx="41"/><Reference refidx="42"/></ListItem><ListItem>Certain types of fatty acids or their metabolites may initiate or           
promote prostate carcinoma development.  The evidence for this              
hypothesis is conflicting, but one study suggests that linoleic acid        
(omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid) may stimulate prostate cancer          
cells, while omega-3 fatty acids inhibit cell growth.<Reference refidx="43"/></ListItem><ListItem>An observation made in an animal model is that male offspring of            
pregnant rats who are fed a high-fat diet will develop prostate cancer at a         
higher rate than animals who are fed a low-fat diet.<Reference refidx="44"/>  This observation may      
explain some of the variations in prostate cancer incidence and             
mortality among ethnic groups; an observation has been made that          
first trimester androgen levels in pregnant blacks are higher than          
those in whites.<Reference refidx="45"/></ListItem></OrderedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_154"><Title>Dairy and Calcium Intake</Title><Para id="_155">In a  meta-analysis of ten cohort studies (eight from the United States and two from Europe), it was concluded that men with the highest intake of dairy products (relative risk [RR] = 1.11; 95% confidence interval  [CI], 1.00–1.22;  <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .04) and calcium (RR = 1.39; 95% CI, 1.09–1.77; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .18) were more likely to develop prostate cancer than men with the lowest intake.

The increase in high-grade tumors was seen within 1 year of finasteride exposure and did not increase during this time period.<Reference refidx="2"/> An analysis of the PCPT data adjusted for the sources of detection bias found that finasteride reduced the incidence of Gleason 5 to 7 and Gleason 3 to 4 prostate cancer, but not Gleason 2 to 3 or Gleason 8 to 10.

The primary endpoint was prostate cancer diagnosed by prostate biopsy at 2 years and 4 years after randomization. After 4 years, among the 6,729 men (82% of initial population) who had at least one prostate biopsy, 25.1% of the placebo group and 19.9% of the dutasteride group had been diagnosed with prostate cancer, a statistically significant difference (absolute risk reduction = 5.1% and RRR = 22.8% [95% CI, 15.2%–29.8%]). The RRR in years 3 to 4 was similar to the RRR in years 1 to 2. The difference between the groups was entirely due to a reduction in prostate cancers with Gleason score 5 to 7.

The review also concluded that mortality effects could not be assessed from these studies and that persistent use of these agents increased sexual and erectile dysfunction.  The review was based on MEDLINE and Cochrane Collaboration Library computerized searches through June 2010 using Medical Subject Headings terms and text words ‘finasteride,’ ‘dutasteride,’ ‘neoplasms,’ ‘azasteroids,’ ‘reductase inhibitors’ and ‘enzyme inhibitors’ to identify randomized trials.  Eight studies met the inclusion criteria.  Only the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial and the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events  study were designed to assess the impact of 5AR inhibitors on prostate cancer period prevalence.  Reviews of all eight studies concluded that compared with placebo, 5AR inhibitors resulted in 25% relative risk (RR) reduction in prostate cancers detected ‘for cause’ [RR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.67–0.83 and 1.4% absolute risk reduction (3.5% vs. 4.9%)].  Six trials of 5AR inhibitors versus placebo assessed prostate cancers detected overall.  Among these there was a 26% RR reduction favoring 5AR inhibitors [RR = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55–1.00 and 2.9% absolute risk reduction (6.3% vs. 9.2%)].  There were reductions across age, race, and family history.  One placebo-controlled trial of men considered at greater risk for prostate cancer based on age, elevated PSA and previous suspicion of prostate cancer leading to a prostate biopsy reported that dutasteride did not reduce prostate cancers detected for cause based on needle biopsy but did reduce risk of overall incident prostate cancer detected by biopsy by 23% [RR = 0.77; 95% CI, 0.7–0.85 and absolute risk reduction 16.1% vs. 20.8%].  There were reductions across age, family history of prostate cancer, PSA level, and prostate volume subgroups.

Of interest, the statistically increased risk of prostate cancer among men receiving vitamin E was seen after study supplements had been discontinued suggesting a prolonged effect of this agent.<Reference refidx="23"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_72"><Title>Chemoprevention with lycopene</Title><Para id="_73">Evidence exists that a diet with a high intake of fruits and vegetables is
associated with a lower risk of cancer.  Which, if any, micronutrients may
account for this reduction is unknown.  One group of nutrients often postulated
as having chemoprevention properties is the carotenoids.  Lycopene is the
predominant circulating carotenoid in Americans and has a number of potential
activities, including an antioxidant effect.<Reference refidx="24"/>  It is encountered in a number
of vegetables, most notably tomatoes, and is best absorbed if these products
are cooked and in the presence of dietary fats or oils.
</Para><Para id="_74">The earliest studies of the association of lycopene and prostate cancer risk
were generally negative before 1995 with only one study of 180 case-control patients
showing a reduced risk.<Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/>  In 1995, an analysis of the Physicians’
Health Study found a one-third reduction in prostate cancer risk in the group
of men with the highest consumption of tomato products when compared with  the group
with the lowest level of consumption, which was attributed to the lycopene
content of these vegetables.<Reference refidx="29"/>  This large analysis prompted several
subsequent studies, the results of which were mixed.<Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="31"/>  A review of the
published data concluded that the evidence is weak that lycopene is associated
with a reduced risk because previous studies were not controlled for total
vegetable intake (i.e., separating the effect of tomatoes from vegetables), dietary intake instruments are poorly able to quantify lycopene
intake, and other potential biases.<Reference refidx="32"/>  Specific dietary supplementation with
lycopene remains to be demonstrated to reduce prostate cancer risk. In the largest prospective study to date, the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, lycopene was not associated with any reduction in risk of prostate cancer among 9,559 men studied.  Similarly, there was no relationship between lycopene serum concentrations and risk of prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="12824459" MedlineID="22750137">Thompson IM, Goodman PJ, Tangen CM, et al.: The influence of finasteride on the development of prostate cancer.
