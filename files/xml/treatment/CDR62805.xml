<ListItem><Strong>Control stress.</Strong> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000450122">Stress</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000430405">anxiety</GlossaryTermRef> can make it harder for you to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454700">cope</GlossaryTermRef> with pruritus.

Talk with your doctor if stress is a problem for you.</ListItem>


<ListItem><Strong>Use moisturizing creams and lotions.</Strong> A skin moisturizer prevents dryness, which can cause itching. A moisturizer contains water and forms a film over the skin's surface to keep it moist.  Choose a moisturizer that meets your own needs.

Baths that are just warm and last no longer than one half hour every day or every two days can help relieve itching. Bathing more often can make dry skin worse. </ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Use mild soaps.</Strong> Mild bath soaps contain less soap or detergent that can irritate skin.

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
