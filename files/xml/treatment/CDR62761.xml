Immunohistochemical analysis, cytogenetic and molecular genetic findings, and measures of mitotic activity are increasingly used in tumor diagnosis and classification. Brain tumors are classified according to histology, but tumor location and extent of spread are important factors that affect treatment and prognosis.</Para><Para id="_62">The PDQ  childhood brain tumor treatment summaries are organized primarily according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of nervous system tumors.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> For a full description of the classification of nervous system tumors and a link to the corresponding treatment summary for each type of brain tumor, refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062680" url="/types/brain/hp/child-brain-treatment-pdq">Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview</SummaryRef>.</Para><Para id="_290">The term <Emphasis>brain stem glioma</Emphasis> is a generic description that refers to any tumor of glial origin arising in the brain stem, inclusive of the midbrain, pons, and medulla.

unnecessary. However, histologic confirmation is currently performed for research studies and may be more routinely recommended in the future.<Reference refidx="6"/>    Biopsy or resection  may be indicated for brain stem tumors that are not diffuse and

In contrast, DIPGs are diffuse astrocytomas which, when biopsied at diagnosis or at postmortem evaluation, are often anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO grade 3) or glioblastoma (WHO grade 4).<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/>  Low-grade fibrillary astrocytomas (WHO grade 2) can occur as focal tumors throughout the brain stem, with a good prognosis.
