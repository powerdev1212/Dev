Gerson (1881-1959), who first used it to treat his migraine headaches.  In the 1930's, Dr. Gerson’s therapy became known to the public as a treatment for a type of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000476079">tuberculosis</GlossaryTermRef> (TB).  The Gerson therapy was later used to treat other <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000651193">conditions,</GlossaryTermRef> including cancer.  </Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_24"><Question>What is the theory behind the claim that the Gerson therapy is useful in treating cancer?</Question><Answer><Para id="_25">The Gerson therapy is based on the idea that cancer develops when there are changes in cell metabolism because of the buildup  of toxic substances  in the body. Dr. Gerson  said the disease process makes more toxins and the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046312">liver</GlossaryTermRef> becomes overworked.   According to Dr. Gerson, people with cancer also have too much sodium and too little potassium in the cells in their bodies, which causes <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissue</GlossaryTermRef> damage and weakened <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000257523">organs</GlossaryTermRef>. </Para><Para id="_32">The goal of the Gerson therapy is to restore the body to health by repairing the liver and returning the metabolism to its normal state. According to Dr. Gerson, this can be done by removing toxins from the body and  building up the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356">immune system</GlossaryTermRef> with diet and supplements. The enemas are said to  widen the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046738">bile ducts</GlossaryTermRef> of the liver so  toxins can be released. According to Dr. Gerson, the liver is further overworked as the treatment <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045864">regimen</GlossaryTermRef> breaks down cancer cells and rids the body of toxins.  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046704">Pancreatic enzymes</GlossaryTermRef> are given to decrease the demands on the weakened liver and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046254">pancreas</GlossaryTermRef> to make enzymes for <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463707">digestion</GlossaryTermRef>. An organic diet and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463726">nutritional supplements</GlossaryTermRef> are used to boost the immune system and support the body as the regimen cleans the body of toxins. Foods low in sodium and high in potassium are said to help correct the tissue damage caused by having too much sodium in the cells.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_12"><Question>How is the Gerson therapy administered?</Question><Answer><Para id="_22">The Gerson therapy requires that the many details of its treatment plan be followed exactly.

Dr. Gerson published <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044007">case histories</GlossaryTermRef> (detailed reports of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046450">diagnosis</GlossaryTermRef>, treatment, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044671">follow-up</GlossaryTermRef> of individual patients) of 50 of his patients. He treated several different types of cancer in his practice.  The reports include Dr. Gerson's notes, with some <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045944">X-rays</GlossaryTermRef> of the patients over time.  The follow-up was contact with patients by mail or phone and included <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043995">anecdotal reports</GlossaryTermRef> (incomplete descriptions of the medical and treatment histories of one or more patients).</Para><Para id="_37">In 1947 and 1959, the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044266">National Cancer Institute</GlossaryTermRef> (NCI) reviewed 
the cases of a total of 60 patients treated by Dr. Gerson. The NCI found that the available information did not prove the regimen had benefit.</Para><Para id="_35">The following studies of the Gerson therapy were published:</Para><ItemizedList id="_34" Style="bullet"><ListItem>In 1983-1984, a retrospective study of 38 patients treated with the Gerson therapy was done. Medical records were not available to the  authors of the study; information came from patient interviews.  These case reviews did not provide information that supports the usefulness of  the Gerson therapy for treating cancer.</ListItem><ListItem>    In 1990, a study of a diet regimen similar to the Gerson therapy was done in Austria. The patients received <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044930">standard treatment</GlossaryTermRef> along with the special diet. The authors of the study reported that the diet appeared to help patients live longer than usual and have fewer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046580">side effects</GlossaryTermRef>. The authors said it needed further study.</ListItem><ListItem>In 1995, the Gerson Research Organization did a retrospective study of their <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045135">melanoma</GlossaryTermRef> patients  who were treated with the Gerson therapy.  The study reported that patients who had <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045138">stage III</GlossaryTermRef> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045139">stage  IV melanoma</GlossaryTermRef> lived longer than usual for patients with these <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045885">stages</GlossaryTermRef> of melanoma.

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_2"><Title>General CAM Information</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_3">Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also referred to as integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_4">Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_5">Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. </Para></SummarySection> 
  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_6"><Title>Evaluation of CAM Approaches</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_7">It is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute  and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_8">Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH)  in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.</Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_9"><ExternalRef xref="http://cam.cancer.gov/cam/best_case_intro.html">The NCI Best Case Series Program</ExternalRef>   which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.</Para></SummarySection>
