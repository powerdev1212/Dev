experienced in the back of the throat and/or the epigastrium that may culminate in vomiting (emesis).  Vomiting is the forceful expulsion of the contents
of the stomach, duodenum, or jejunum through the oral cavity.  Retching is
gastric and esophageal movements of vomiting without expulsion of vomitus and
is also referred to as dry heaves.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_5"><Title>Classifications</Title><Para id="_6">Various classifications of N&amp;V have been used,<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="6"/>
including acute, delayed, late or persistent, chronic, anticipatory,
breakthrough, or refractory, as well as distinctions related to type of
treatment (e.g., chemotherapy induced or radiation induced) and clinical course of disease (e.g.,
advanced or terminal disease).<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/>  Despite this variety, the most commonly
described types of N&amp;V are acute, delayed, and anticipatory chemotherapy-induced N&amp;V
and chronic N&amp;V in advanced cancer patients.  Although there are no standard
definitions, the following are commonly used to classify the different types.
</Para><ItemizedList id="_186" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem><Strong>Acute N&amp;V:</Strong> N&amp;V experienced during the first 24-hour
period after chemotherapy administration is considered acute N&amp;V.<Reference refidx="1"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Delayed (or late) N&amp;V:</Strong> N&amp;V that occurs more than 24
hours after chemotherapy administration is considered delayed, or late, N&amp;V. 
Delayed N&amp;V is associated with cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and other drugs
(e.g., doxorubicin and ifosfamide) given at high doses or on 2 or more
consecutive days.
</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Anticipatory nausea and vomiting (ANV):</Strong> ANV is nausea and/or vomiting that
occurs prior to the beginning of a new cycle of chemotherapy in response to
conditioned stimuli such as the smells, sights, and sounds of the treatment
room.  ANV is a classically conditioned response that typically occurs after three
or four prior chemotherapy treatments, following which the person experienced
acute or delayed N&amp;V.
</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Chronic N&amp;V in advanced cancer patients:</Strong> Chronic
N&amp;V in the advanced cancer patient is N&amp;V associated with a
variety of potential etiologies.  A definitive understanding of cause is neither
well known nor well researched, but potential causal factors include
gastrointestinal, cranial, metabolic, drug-induced (e.g., morphine), cytotoxic
chemotherapy, and radiation-induced mechanisms.<Reference refidx="9"/></ListItem></ItemizedList><Table id="_395"><Title>Table 1.

control nausea and vomiting (emesis) (N&amp;V).  Both are controlled or mediated by the central
nervous system but by different mechanisms.  Nausea is mediated through the
autonomic nervous system.  Vomiting results from the stimulation of a complex
reflex that is coordinated by a putative true vomiting center, which may be
located in the dorsolateral reticular formation near the medullary respiratory
centers.  The vomiting center presumably receives convergent afferent
stimulation from several central neurologic pathways, including the
following:<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>
</Para><ItemizedList id="_13" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>A chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ).
</ListItem>
<ListItem>The cerebral cortex and the limbic system in response to sensory            
stimulation (particularly smell and taste), psychologic distress, and pain.
</ListItem>
<ListItem>The vestibular-labyrinthine apparatus of the inner ear in response to body
motion.
</ListItem>
<ListItem>Peripheral stimuli from visceral organs and vasculature (via vagal and      
spinal sympathetic nerves) as a result of exogenous chemicals and           
endogenous substances that accumulate during inflammation, ischemia, and    
irritation.
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList><Para id="_14">The CTZ is located in the area postrema, one of the circumventricular regions
of the brain on the dorsal surface of the medulla oblongata at the caudal end
of the fourth ventricle.  Unlike vasculature within the blood-brain diffusion
barrier, the area postrema is highly vascularized with fenestrated blood
vessels, which lack tight junctions (<Emphasis>zonae occludentes</Emphasis>) between capillary
endothelial cells.  The CTZ is anatomically specialized to readily sample
elements present in the circulating blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/>
</Para><Para id="_15">Currently, evidence indicates that acute emesis following chemotherapy is
initiated by the release of neurotransmitters from cells that are susceptible
to the presence of toxic substances in the blood or CSF.  Area postrema cells
in the CTZ and enterochromaffin cells within the intestinal mucosa are
implicated in initiating and propagating afferent stimuli that ultimately
converge on central structures corresponding to a vomiting center.  The
relative contribution from these multiple pathways culminating in N&amp;V symptoms is complex and is postulated to account for the variable
emetogenicity (intrinsic emetogenicity and mitigating factors [i.e., dosage,
administration route, and exposure duration]) and emetogenic profile (i.e., time to
onset, symptom severity, and duration) of agents.

(5-hydroxytryptamine-3 or 5-HT<Subscript>3</Subscript> receptor antagonists), it was anticipated that the prevalence of ANV
might decline; however, studies have shown mixed results.  One study found a
lower incidence of ANV,<Reference refidx="3"/> and three studies found comparable incidence

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_23"><Title>Classical Conditioning</Title><Para id="_24">Although other theoretical mechanisms have been proposed,<Reference refidx="6"/> ANV appears to be
best explained by classical conditioning (also known as Pavlovian or respondent
conditioning).<Reference refidx="7"/>  In classical conditioning, a previously neutral stimulus
(e.g., smells of the chemotherapy environment) elicits a conditioned
response (e.g., ANV) after a number of prior pairings or learning trials.  In
cancer chemotherapy, the first few chemotherapy infusions are the learning
trials.  The chemotherapy drugs are the unconditioned stimuli that elicit
postchemotherapy nausea and vomiting (N&amp;V) (in some patients).  The drugs are paired with
a variety of other neutral, environmental stimuli (e.g., smells of the setting,
oncology nurse, chemotherapy room).  These previously neutral stimuli then
become conditioned stimuli and elicit ANV in future chemotherapy cycles.  ANV
is not an indication of psychopathology but is rather a learned response that, in
other life situations (e.g., food poisoning), results in adaptive avoidance.
</Para><Para id="_415">  A
variety of correlational studies provide empirical support for classical
conditioning.  For example, the prevalence of ANV prior to any chemotherapy is
very rare, and few patients ever experience ANV without prior postchemotherapy
nausea.<Reference refidx="8"/>  Also, most studies have found (1) a higher probability of ANV with
increasing numbers of chemotherapy infusions, and (2) the intensity of ANV
increasing as patients get closer to the actual time of their infusion.<Reference refidx="9"/>  In
one experimental study, it was shown that a novel beverage could become a
conditioned stimulus to nausea when paired with several chemotherapy
treatments.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_25"><Title>Variables Correlated with ANV</Title><Para id="_26">Many variables have been investigated as potential factors that correlate with

treatment-related nausea and vomiting (N&amp;V).  The basis for antiemetic therapy is the
neurochemical control of vomiting.  Although the exact mechanism is not well
understood, peripheral neuroreceptors and the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ)
are known to contain receptors for serotonin, histamine (H1 and H2), dopamine,
acetylcholine, opioids, and numerous other endogenous neurotransmitters.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> 
Many antiemetics act by competitively blocking receptors for these substances,
thereby inhibiting stimulation of peripheral nerves at the CTZ and possibly at
the vomiting center.  Most drugs with proven antiemetic activity can be
categorized into one of the following groups: </Para><ItemizedList id="_193" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Competitive antagonists at

of the following drugs, the intramuscular (IM) route is used only when no
other access is available.  IM delivery is painful, is associated
with erratic absorption of drug, and may lead to sterile abscess formation or
fibrosis of the tissues.  This is particularly important when more than one or two
doses of a drug are to be given.
</Para><SummarySection id="_163"><Title>Phenothiazines</Title><Para id="_69">Phenothiazines act on dopaminergic receptors at the CTZ, possibly at other central nervous system (CNS) centers, and peripherally.  With the exception of thioridazine, many
phenothiazines possess antiemetic activity, including chlorpromazine given in
the 10- to 50-mg dose range orally, IM, intravenously (IV), and 
rectally (pediatric dose for patients &gt;12 years: 10 mg every 6–8 hours;
for patients &lt;12 years: 5 mg every 6–8 hours); thiethylperazine given in
the 5- to 10-mg dose range orally, IM, and IV; and
perphenazine.  The primary consideration in selecting phenothiazines are
differences in their adverse effect profiles, which substantially correlate
with their structural classes.  Generally, aliphatic phenothiazines (e.g.,
chlorpromazine, methotrimeprazine) produce sedation and anticholinergic
effects, while piperazines (e.g., prochlorperazine, thiethylperazine,
perphenazine, fluphenazine) are associated with less sedation but greater
incidence of extrapyramidal reactions (EPRs).
</Para><SummarySection id="_164"><Title>Prochlorperazine</Title><Para id="_71">Prochlorperazine is perhaps the most frequently (and empirically) used antiemetic and,
in low doses, is generally effective in preventing nausea associated with
radiation therapy and in treating N&amp;V attributed to very low to
moderately emetogenic chemotherapeutic drugs.  Prochlorperazine is a phenothiazine and can be
given orally, IM, IV, and rectally.  It is usually
given in the 10- to 50-mg dose range (pediatric dose for children who weigh &gt;10 kg or who are  &gt;2 years: orally or rectally, 0.4 mg/kg/dose tid–qid; or IM, 0.1–0.15 mg/kg/dose tid–qid, maximum 40 mg/d). 
Higher prochlorperazine doses (e.g., 0.2–0.6 mg/kg/dose) are also given
IV for patients receiving chemotherapy with high emetogenic potential.<Reference refidx="3"/>;<Reference refidx="4"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]

however, both agents have some antiemetic activity.  Droperidol is

</Title><Para id="_78">Metoclopramide is  a substituted benzamide, which, prior to the introduction of serotonin (5-HT<Subscript>3</Subscript>)
receptor antagonists, was considered the most effective single antiemetic agent
against highly emetogenic chemotherapy such as cisplatin.  Although
metoclopramide is a competitive antagonist at dopaminergic (D2) receptors, it
is most effective against acute vomiting when given IV at high doses
(e.g., 0.5–3 mg/kg/dose), probably because it is a weak competitive antagonist
(relative to other serotonin antagonists) at 5-HT<Subscript>3</Subscript> receptors.  It may act on
the CTZ and the periphery.  Metoclopramide also increases lower esophageal
sphincter pressure and enhances the rate of gastric emptying, which may factor
into its overall antiemetic effect.  It can be administered IV at
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg every 2 hours (or less frequently) for three
to five doses.  Metoclopramide has also been safely given by IV bolus
injection at higher single doses (up to 6 mg/kg) and by continuous IV
infusion, with or without a loading bolus dose, with efficacy comparable to
multiple intermittent dosing schedules.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Para id="_352">Metoclopramide is associated

mesylate, and trihexyphenidyl are commonly used prophylactically or
therapeutically to pharmacologically antagonize EPRs.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="16"/>  While cogwheeling rigidity, acute dystonia, and tremor are

enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal (GI) mucosa, from initiating afferent
transmission to the CNS via vagal and spinal sympathetic nerves.<Reference refidx="17"/>   The 5-HT<Subscript>3</Subscript>

occurring in approximately 21% to 68% of these patients.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>  The underlying
pathophysiology and treatment differs somewhat from nausea related to radiation
treatment or chemotherapy.  Chronic nausea can significantly impair a patient’s
quality of life. 
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_124"><Title>Pathophysiology and Causes</Title><Para id="_125">Chronic nausea in the advanced cancer setting is often multifactorial in
origin.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>  Medications, including some that are frequently prescribed in this
setting—such as opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants—may be
responsible.
</Para><Para id="_358">In the case of opioids, nausea frequently resolves spontaneously
a few days after initiation of treatment.  In some cases, however, it may
persist.  Nausea resulting from the accumulation of active opioid metabolites
(morphine-6-glucuronide) has been described,<Reference refidx="4"/> and patients with impaired
renal function may be at increased risk.  Opioids invariably produce
constipation if prophylactic measures are not taken (namely, the use of a
regular laxative regimen), and constipation is one of the most common causes of
nausea in patients with advanced cancer.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/>  
</Para><Para id="_359">Opioid-induced gastrointestinal (GI)
motility problems may compound the problem of diminished GI
motility that many patients experience as part of the anorexia-cachexia
syndrome of advanced cancer.  The autonomic dysfunction that often accompanies
this syndrome results in decreased GI motility, early satiety,
and chronic nausea.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/>  Other causes of chronic nausea in these patients
include the following:<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_360" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Raised intracranial pressure (from metastatic brain disease or primary
brain tumors).</ListItem><ListItem>Metabolic abnormalities such as hypercalcemia, hyponatremia, and
uremia.</ListItem><ListItem>Dehydration.</ListItem><ListItem>Malignant bowel obstruction.</ListItem><ListItem>Gastroduodenal ulcers.</ListItem><ListItem>Infections of the mouth, pharynx, or esophagus.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_361"> 
Nausea, like many other symptoms, may have psychological undercurrents that
either exacerbate or induce chronic nausea.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_126"><Title>Assessment</Title><Para id="_127">A comprehensive history that includes determining the frequency and
effectiveness of bowel movements and laxative therapy is essential.  Concurrent
medications are reviewed, and the frequency and nature of N&amp;V is documented.  Examination will assess for bowel obstruction, fecal impaction, dehydration, and raised
intracranial pressure.  History and physical examination are poor at
determining the extent of constipation.<Reference refidx="5"/>  A plain flat-plate x-ray of the
abdomen can be very useful to this end.<Reference refidx="13"/>  Surgical x-ray views of the
abdomen may be helpful if a bowel obstruction is suspected.  Investigations to
determine blood levels of electrolytes, calcium, and renal parameters may also
be helpful.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_128"><Title>Management</Title><Para id="_129">Management centers on identifying the underlying causes, addressing these when
possible, and controlling the symptoms.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>  A basic working knowledge of the
emetic pathways and identification of possible underlying causes guide
antiemetic selection.</Para><Para id="_362">Multiple antiemetic regimens have been proposed for the
management of chronic nausea in the advanced cancer setting.  Prospective
studies comparing one regimen with another are lacking.  Metoclopramide or
domperidone are generally recommended as first-line agents because they improve
GI motility and act on the chemoreceptor trigger zone (as a
result of their antidopaminergic properties).<Reference refidx="14"/>  Metoclopramide can be
administered orally or parenterally (subcutaneously or intravenously [IV]) at doses
of 10 mg, 4 times a day, or on an every-4-hour basis, depending on the severity of
the nausea.  Rescue doses are ordered on an as-needed basis to
manage the episodic worsening of nausea that may occur.</Para><Para id="_363">Extrapyramidal-related
adverse effects are a potential complication of these medications but appear
to occur infrequently.  Domperidone, which is currently unavailable in the
United States, is associated with fewer of these adverse effects. 
Unfortunately, this drug is not available in a parenteral formulation.
Dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) or antihistamine agents may be used if a complete
bowel obstruction is suspected (in which case prokinetic agents are
contraindicated) or if patients are intolerant to other antiemetic agents. 
Haloperidol, a potent antidopamine agent, may be considered if bowel
obstruction is the underlying problem.<Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Para id="_364">The phenothiazine drugs are
sometimes used,<Reference refidx="16"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] but the high incidence of adverse effects such as somnolence
and anticholinergic-related effects (orthostatic hypotension and confusion)
limit their role.  Chlorpromazine has modest antiemetic activity but a high
incidence of sedation, postural hypotension, and anticholinergic adverse
effects, while piperazine derivatives such as prochlorperazine are stronger
antiemetics but cause more extrapyramidal side effects.  Hyoscine butylbromide,
on the other hand, can be useful for patients experiencing colic from complete
bowel obstruction.</Para><Para id="_130">A continuous parenteral infusion of metoclopramide, at doses of 60 to 120 mg/day, may be helpful for patients with intractable chronic nausea.<Reference refidx="17"/>  The
judicious use of corticosteroids such as dexamethasone in selected patients may be useful in conjunction with a more traditional antiemetic, although one study has suggested that dexamethasone was not better than placebo in patients who were not controlled with metoclopramide.<Reference refidx="18"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]  The
exact mechanism of action and the optimal dose of corticosteroids for this
indication are not known.
</Para><Para id="_131">In contrast to radiation therapy–induced nausea or chemotherapy-induced nausea, the role of
5-HT<Subscript>3</Subscript> receptor antagonists (such as ondansetron) is not clear in the setting of
chronic nausea in advanced cancer, but it appears to be limited to a small number
of highly selected cases, specifically those that have failed all other
treatments.<Reference refidx="19"/>
</Para><Para id="_188"> A case series study has suggested an antiemetic effect for olanzapine (an atypical antipsychotic) in advanced cancer patients being treated with opioids who are complaining of apparent opiate-induced nausea.  However, further study and comparison with standard management are required.<Reference refidx="20"/></Para><Para id="_132">The management of constipation can be divided into general interventions and
therapeutic measures.<Reference refidx="21"/>  The general interventions include the prevention of
constipation by initiating regular laxative regimens, particularly in patients
on opioid treatment, and where possible, the elimination of medical factors
that may be contributing to constipation (e.g., discontinuation of nonessential
constipating drugs).  Prophylactic laxative regimens may consist of stool
softeners such as docusate and bowel stimulants such as sennosides. 
Occasionally lactulose may be added. If necessary, a  hyperosmolar laxative such as lactulose or polyethylene glycol may be added.<Reference refidx="22"/>  These regimens are reviewed on a
regular basis and their doses adjusted, depending on the regularity of bowel
movements.  High-fiber diets, while generally recommended, may be difficult for
patients with very advanced cancer.  Bulk agents such as psyllium or cellulose
are unsuitable for patients with advanced cancer because the high fluid intake
required with these agents is often intolerable to patients.

administered orally or rectally, as follows:</Para><ItemizedList id="_367" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Oral laxatives, including bulk agents, osmotic
agents, contact cathartics, and agents for colonic lavage.</ListItem><ListItem>Saline laxatives,
including sodium salts (sodium phosphate) and magnesium salts (magnesium
citrate), may be useful to treat established constipation.</ListItem><ListItem>Sodium phosphates
are generally administered rectally as an enema, but oral solutions are also
available.</ListItem><ListItem>Magnesium citrate is generally administered orally and can be
especially useful if the constipation is primarily in the proximal bowel.</ListItem><ListItem>The
contact cathartic bisacodyl, available as a suppository, may also be useful for
treating established constipation.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_368">Once the constipation is cleared, the
background laxative regimen (e.g., sennoside and docusate) is reviewed
with a view to optimizing it.  The action of the saline and magnesium salts
is not physiological, and regular ongoing administration is avoided. 
Saline laxatives are used with caution in patients with renal impairment
or cardiac failure.  Mineral oil enemas are used occasionally and act as both
lubricants and stool softeners; however, they may interfere with the absorption of
fat-soluble vitamins, and there is a risk of lipoid pneumonia in
debilitated patients.  The use of enemas and rectal suppositories is usually
limited to the acute short-term management of more severe episodes of
constipation.  However, patients with neurogenic bowel problems (e.g., patients with
irreversible spinal cord compression) often require regular ongoing
treatment with suppositories as part of their bowel care.  The rectal route is
contraindicated in patients with mucosal integrity/bowel-wall compromise.
 (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062736" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/constipation/GI-complications-hp-pdq">Gastrointestinal Complications</SummaryRef> for more information.)</Para><Para id="_134">There have been no adequate comparative studies between the
various laxatives to make evidence-based recommendations on which laxative
regimen is optimal.  Patients with advanced cancer are at risk of becoming
constipated and generally require a regular bowel regimen, even if they are not
eating. This need is amplified when they are on opioid treatment.  On occasion,
patients may present with a refractory narcotic bowel syndrome despite
aggressive bowel care.  Methylnaltrexone, a quaternary derivative of naltrexone, is an opioid antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier.    Preliminary studies suggest that it may be effective when given subcutaneously in the management of opioid-associated constipation without causing opioid withdrawal.<Reference refidx="23"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>];<Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/> Methylnaltrexone is avoided in cases of bowel obstruction and suspected bowel obstruction.   This has not been studied in children.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_135"><Title>Malignant Bowel Obstruction</Title><Para id="_136">The initial approach to assessing and managing malignant bowel obstruction in
the advanced cancer patient involves determining whether the obstruction is
reversible and whether the obstruction is partial or complete.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/>
Suitability for surgery such as resection or intestinal bypassing is
assessed.  Several medical options are available to improve the comfort of
patients with inoperable bowel obstructions.<Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/>  Less aggressive surgical
procedures such as the insertion of a venting gastrostomy tube can provide
considerable relief.  When the obstruction is
complete and irreversible, the creation of ostomies may also provide relief.  Nasogastric tubes may be
used temporarily until the obstruction resolves; however, when the obstruction is
irreversible, other options such as the insertion of a gastrostomy tube are considered.
</Para><Para id="_365">Antiemetic agents with prokinetic properties are relatively
contraindicated in the presence of a complete obstruction, and alternative
agents such as an antihistamine or haloperidol may be required.  Clinical
experience suggests that corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone at a starting
dose of 6–10 mg subcutaneously, 3–4 times a day) may be useful for malignant
bowel obstruction.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/>  The optimal dose and duration of treatment has not
been clarified. </Para><Para id="_366">Hydration and drugs such as opioids and antiemetics are
administered via routes other than the oral route.  The subcutaneous route can
be very convenient and effective for both hydration and opioid administration. 
This route is as effective as IV administration, is less invasive, and
requires less maintenance than the IV route.  Octreotide, a somatostatin
analog, can be useful at doses of 100 µg   to 200 µg subcutaneously, 3 times
a day, for refractory obstruction.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="31"/>  In the United States, octreotide is often
administered as a continuous infusion.  If the obstruction causes severe colic,
hyoscine butylbromide may be considered.  The use of colonic endoluminal
stenting devices in selected patients is gaining increasing attention.<Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Pereira J, Bruera E: Chronic nausea.

to the brain is believed to stimulate the brain’s vomiting center or chemoreceptor trigger zone.  Similar to chemotherapy, radiation dose factors
also play a role in determining the possible occurrence of N&amp;V.
