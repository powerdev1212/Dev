With an estimated incidence of 0.015 per 100,000 population and an estimated prevalence of .005% in the United States, parathyroid cancer is one of the rarest of all human cancers.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> In Europe, the United States, and Japan, parathyroid carcinoma has been estimated to cause hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in .017% to 5.2% of the cases; however,   many series report this entity to account for less than 1% of patients with primary HPT.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>  The median age in most series is between 45 and 51 years.<Reference refidx="1"/>  The ratio of affected women to men is 1:1 in contrast to primary HPT in which there is a significant female predominance (ratio of 3–4:1).<Reference refidx="5"/>
 
</Para><Para id="_61">The etiology of parathyroid carcinoma is unknown; however, an increased risk of parathyroid cancer has been associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 and with autosomal dominant familial isolated hyperparathyroidism.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/>  Parathyroid cancer has also been associated with external radiation exposure; however, most reports describe an association between radiation and the more common parathyroid adenoma.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_62">Parathyroid cancer typically runs an indolent, albeit tenacious, course because the tumor has a rather low malignant potential.  At initial presentation, very few patients with parathyroid carcinoma have metastases either to regional lymph nodes (&lt;5%) or distant sites (&lt;2%).<Reference refidx="1"/>  In the National Cancer Database series of 286 patients, only 16 (5.6%) had lymph node metastases noted at the time of initial surgery.<Reference refidx="2"/>  A higher proportion of parathyroid cancers locally invade the thyroid gland, overlying strap muscles, recurrent laryngeal nerve, trachea, or esophagus.  Some patients are not identified preoperatively or intraoperatively as having parathyroid carcinoma and undergo parathyroid procedures devised to treat parathyroid adenoma.  Only after review of the postsurgical pathology, or when these patients experience local or distant recurrence, is a correct diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma made.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Parathyroid carcinoma tends to be localized in the inferior parathyroid glands; one series reported that the primary tumor originating in the inferior parathyroid glands was found in 15 of 19 cases involving local invasion.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_63">Approximately 40% to 60% of patients experience a postsurgical recurrence, typically in the range of 2 to 5 years after the initial resection.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/>  In most cases, hypercalcemia precedes physical evidence of recurrent disease.     The location of recurrence is typically regional, either in the tissues of the neck or in cervical lymph nodes, and accounts for approximately two thirds of recurrent cases.<Reference refidx="13"/>  Often, local recurrences in the neck are difficult to identify because they may be small and multifocal, and they may involve scar tissue from a previous surgical procedure. Use of ultrasonography, sestamibi-thallium scanning, and positron emission tomography may help to identify difficult-to-detect recurrent disease.<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/>  In older studies, distant metastases were reported to occur in 25% of patients, primarily in the lungs but also in the bone and liver.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="17"/>  More recent series indicate that the incidence of recurrence may be higher, possibly because of  more accurate pathologic diagnoses that exclude patients with atypical adenomas.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Because of its low malignant potential, the morbidity and mortality associated with parathyroid cancer primarily result from the metabolic consequences of the disease and not directly from malignant growth.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="17"/>  In the National Cancer Database series of 286 patients, the 10-year survival rate was reported to be approximately 49%.<Reference refidx="2"/>  A smaller series has reported a 10-year survival rate of 77%, which might be related to improvements in supportive medical care and in the prevention of fatal hypercalcemia.<Reference refidx="9"/> </Para><Para id="_64">Operatively, parathyroid cancers may be distinguished from adenomas by their firm, stony-hard consistency and lobulation; adenomas tend to be soft, round, or oval in shape, and of a reddish-brown color.<Reference refidx="5"/>  In most series, the median maximal diameter of parathyroid carcinoma is between 3.0 cm and 3.5 cm compared with approximately 1.5 cm for benign adenomas.<Reference refidx="1"/>  In approximately 50% of the patients, the malignant tumor is surrounded by a dense, fibrous, grayish-white capsule that infiltrates adjacent tissues.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Histopathologically, as with other endocrine neoplasms, the distinction between benign and malignant parathyroid tumors is difficult to make.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="18"/>  The extent to which capsular and vascular invasion appears to be unequivocally correlated with tumor recurrences and metastases makes a strong case for these findings to be considered the sole pathognomonic markers of malignancy.<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/></Para><Para id="_65">Parathyroid cancers are hyperfunctional unlike other endocrine tumors that become less hormonally active when malignant.<Reference refidx="1"/>  The clinical features of parathyroid carcinoma are caused primarily by the effects of excessive secretion of parathormone (PTH) by the tumor rather than by the infiltration of vital organs by tumor cells. Serum PTH levels may be 3 to 10 times above the upper limit of normal for the assay employed; this marked elevation is uncommon in primary HPT where serum PTH concentrations are typically less than twice that of normal.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Accordingly, signs and symptoms of hypercalcemia typically dominate the clinical picture and may include typical hyperparathyroid bone disease and features of renal involvement, such as nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis.<Reference refidx="1"/>   Renal colic is a frequent presenting complaint of patients with parathyroid carcinoma.<Reference refidx="5"/> In a study involving 43 cases, the prevalence of nephrolithiasis  and the prevalence of renal insufficiency were reported to be 56% and 84%, respectively.<Reference refidx="20"/> </Para><Para id="_66">The prevalence of bone disease is much greater in patients with parathyroid carcinoma than it is in patients with parathyroid adenoma with 70% or fewer  patients manifesting symptoms related to calcium absorption with osteoporosis and bone pain.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/>  (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062738" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/pain/pain-hp-pdq">Pain</SummaryRef> for more information.) In benign parathyroid disease, it is unusual to have both renal and bone symptomatology documented at the time of diagnosis.<Reference refidx="23"/>  These symptoms are present simultaneously at diagnosis in 50% or fewer patients with parathyroid cancer.<Reference refidx="1"/>  In contrast, simultaneous renal and overt skeletal involvement is distinctly unusual in primary HPT.<Reference refidx="5"/> </Para><Para id="_74"><Strong><Emphasis>Signs and symptoms of the hyperparathyroid state associated with parathyroid cancer that may be found at diagnosis include:</Emphasis></Strong><Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="5"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_67" Style="bullet"><ListItem>	Subcortical bone resorption.</ListItem><ListItem>	Bone pain. </ListItem><ListItem>	Pathological fractures. </ListItem><ListItem>	Palpable neck mass. </ListItem><ListItem>	Renal calculi. </ListItem><ListItem>	Renal disease.</ListItem><ListItem>	Renal colic. </ListItem><ListItem>	Peptic ulcer. </ListItem><ListItem>	Recurrent pancreatitis.</ListItem><ListItem>	Fatigue. </ListItem><ListItem>	Muscle weakness.</ListItem><ListItem>	Weight loss. </ListItem><ListItem>	Anorexia.</ListItem><ListItem>	Polyuria.</ListItem><ListItem>	Polydipsia.</ListItem><ListItem>	Dehydration.</ListItem><ListItem>	Nausea and vomiting. </ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_93">(Refer to the PDQ summaries on   <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062738" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/pain/pain-hp-pdq">Pain</SummaryRef>,  <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062734" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/fatigue/fatigue-hp-pdq">Fatigue</SummaryRef>,  <SummaryRef href="CDR0000276584" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/appetite-loss/nutrition-hp-pdq">Nutrition in Cancer Care</SummaryRef> [for weight-loss information],  and <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062747" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/nausea/nausea-hp-pdq">Nausea and Vomiting</SummaryRef>, for information on some of the above symptoms.)</Para><Para id="_68">Certain clinical features may help to distinguish parathyroid carcinoma from parathyroid adenoma. </Para><Para id="_82"><Strong><Emphasis>Parathyroid

The increased potential for long-term local control achieved by en bloc excision outweighs the complication of postoperative vocal cord paralysis, which can be improved with techniques such as Teflon injection into the paralyzed cord.  Cervical lymph node dissection should be performed only for enlarged or firm nodes, particularly those found in the level VI paratracheal nodes and levels III and IV internal jugular nodes.<Reference refidx="1"/>  </Para><Para id="_71">Because of the fairly indolent biology of this cancer, the management of recurrent or metastatic disease is primarily surgical; significant palliation may result from the resection of even very small tumor deposits in the neck, lymph nodes, lungs, or liver.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/>  Accessible distant metastases should be resected when possible.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Localization studies performed before the first operation or reoperation may include technetium Tc 99m sestamibi scan, single photon emission computed tomography, CT-MIBI image fusion, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), selective angiogram, and selective venous sampling for PTH;<Reference refidx="3"/> CT and magnetic resonance imaging are useful imaging adjuncts for the localization of distant metastases.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="30"/> </Para><Para id="_72">Nonsurgical forms of therapy for parathyroid carcinoma generally have poor results.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="18"/>  Some investigators have advocated the use of adjuvant radiation therapy to decrease the local recurrence rate.<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/>  Patients with this disease should be monitored for life because they may be at a relatively high risk of multiple relapses over prolonged periods of time.<Reference refidx="9"/>  As stated previously, patients rarely die from the tumor itself; rather, they die from the metabolic complications of uncontrolled HPT. </Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Rahbari R, Kebebew E: Parathyroid tumors.

This procedure will involve a parathyroidectomy, typically an ipsilateral thyroidectomy (thyroid lobectomy), and possibly resection of adjacent cervical muscles, paratracheal tissues, and the recurrent laryngeal nerve, if involved. Lymphadenectomy, beyond that necessary to achieve an en bloc excision of the primary malignancy, is not indicated unless enlarged or firm nodes clinically indicate the presence of nodal disease. Local recurrence may be minimized by this en bloc resection approach.
