Bilateral disease is somewhat more common in patients with infiltrating lobular

At 10 years after diagnosis, the risk of a primary breast cancer in the contralateral breast ranges from 3% to 10%, although endocrine therapy decreases that risk.<Reference refidx="72"/><Reference refidx="73"/><Reference refidx="74"/>   The development of a contralateral breast cancer is associated with
an increased risk of distant recurrence.<Reference refidx="75"/> When  <Emphasis>BRCA1</Emphasis>/<Emphasis>BRCA2</Emphasis> mutation carriers were diagnosed before age 40 years, the risk of a contralateral breast cancer reached nearly 50% in the ensuing 25 years.<Reference refidx="76"/><Reference refidx="77"/></Para><Para id="_1072">Patients who have breast cancer will undergo bilateral
mammography at the time of diagnosis to rule out synchronous disease. To

Because an increased detection rate of mammographically occult disease has been demonstrated, the selective use of MRI for additional screening is occurring more frequently despite the absence of randomized, controlled data.  Because only 25% of MRI-positive findings represent malignancy, pathologic confirmation before treatment is recommended.  Whether this increased detection rate will translate into improved treatment outcome is unknown.<Reference refidx="78"/><Reference refidx="79"/><Reference refidx="80"/>

Size should be measured to the nearest millimeter. If the tumor size is slightly less than or greater than a cutoff for a given T classification, it is recommended that the size be rounded to the millimeter reading that is closest to the cutoff. For example, a reported size of 1.1 mm is reported as 1 mm, or a size of 2.01 cm is reported as 2.0 cm. Designation should be made with the subscript "c" or "p" modifier to indicate whether the T classification was determined by clinical (physical examination or radiologic) or pathologic measurements, respectively.

DCIS can progress to become invasive cancer, but estimates of the likelihood of this vary widely.  Some people include DCIS in breast cancer statistics.  The frequency of the diagnosis of DCIS has increased markedly in the United States since the widespread use of screening mammography.  In 1998, DCIS accounted for about 18% of all newly diagnosed invasive plus noninvasive breast tumors in the United States.    
</Para><Para id="_345">Very few cases of DCIS present as a palpable mass;
80% are diagnosed by mammography alone.<Reference refidx="1"/>  DCIS comprises a heterogeneous
group of histopathologic lesions that have been classified into several
subtypes based primarily on architectural pattern: micropapillary, papillary,
solid, cribriform, and comedo.  Comedo-type DCIS consists of cells that appear
cytologically malignant, with the presence of high-grade nuclei,
pleomorphism, and abundant central luminal necrosis.  Comedo-type DCIS appears
to be more aggressive, with a higher probability of associated invasive ductal
carcinoma.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_75"><Title>Treatment Option Overview</Title><Para id="_76">Until recently, the customary treatment of DCIS was mastectomy.<Reference refidx="1"/>  The
rationale for mastectomy included a 30% incidence of multicentric disease, a
40% prevalence of residual tumor at mastectomy following wide excision alone,
and a 25% to 50% incidence of breast recurrence following limited surgery for
palpable tumor, with 50% of those recurrences being invasive carcinoma.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="3"/> 
The combined local and distant recurrence rate following mastectomy is 1% to
2%.  
No randomized comparisons of mastectomy versus breast-conserving surgery plus breast radiation are available.</Para><Para id="_456">In view of the success of breast-conserving surgery combined with breast radiation for invasive carcinoma, this conservative approach was extended to the noninvasive entity.  To determine whether breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy was a reasonable approach to the management of DCIS, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) have each completed prospective randomized trials in which women with localized DCIS and negative surgical margins following excisional biopsy were randomized to either breast radiation (50 Gy) or to no further therapy.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/>
</Para><Para id="_768">Of the 818 women  enrolled in the  NSABP-B-17  trial, 80% were diagnosed by mammography, and 70% of the patients' lesions were 1 cm or less.  At the 12-year actuarial follow-up interval, the overall rate of in-breast tumor recurrence was reduced from 31.7% to 15.7% when radiation therapy was delivered (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .005).  Radiation therapy reduced the occurrence of invasive cancer from 16.8% to 7.7% (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .001) and recurrent DCIS from 14.6% to 8.0% (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .001).<Reference refidx="7"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335129">Level of evidence: 1iiDii</LOERef>]  Nine pathologic features were evaluated for their ability to predict for in-breast recurrence, but only comedo necrosis was determined to be a  significant predictor for recurrence.  </Para><Para id="_462">Similarly, of the 1,010 patients enrolled in the EORTC-10853  trial, mammography detected lesions in 71% of the women.  At a median follow-up of 10.5 years, the overall rate of in-breast tumor recurrence was reduced from 26% to 15% (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001) with a similarly effective reduction of invasive (13% to 8%, <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .065) and noninvasive (14% to 7%, <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .001) recurrence rates.<Reference refidx="7"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335129">Level of evidence: 1iiDii</LOERef>]  In this analysis, parameters associated with an increased risk of in-breast recurrence included age 40 years or younger, palpable disease, intermediate or poorly differentiated DCIS, cribriform or solid growth pattern, and indeterminate margins.  Elsewhere, margins of less than 1 mm have been associated with an unacceptable local recurrence rate, even with radiation therapy.<Reference refidx="8"/>  In both of the studies reported here, the effect of radiation therapy was consistent across all assessed risk factors.</Para><Para id="_1383">The results of these two trials plus two others were included in a meta-analysis that demonstrated reductions in all ipsilateral breast events (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41–0.58; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .00001), ipsilateral invasive recurrence (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.32–0.76; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .001), and ipsilateral DCIS recurrence (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.39–0.95; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .03).<Reference refidx="9"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000632558">Level of evidence: 1iiD</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_79">Given that lumpectomy and radiation therapy are generally applicable for most
patients with DCIS, can a subset of patients be identified with such a low risk
of local recurrence that postoperative radiation therapy can be omitted?  To identify such a favorable group of patients, several pathologic
staging systems have been developed and tested retrospectively, but consensus
recommendations have not been achieved.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/>  </Para><Para id="_769">The Van Nuys Prognostic Index, which combines three  predictors of local recurrence (i.e., tumor size, margin
width, and pathologic classification), was used to retrospectively analyze 333
patients treated with either excision alone or excision and radiation
therapy.<Reference refidx="13"/>  Using this prognostic index, patients with favorable lesions, who
received surgical excision alone, had a low recurrence rate (i.e., 2% with a median
follow-up of 79 months).  A subsequent analysis of these data was performed to
determine the influence of margin width on local control.<Reference refidx="14"/>  Patients whose
excised lesions had margin widths 10 mm or larger in every direction
had an extremely low probability of local recurrence with surgery alone (4%
with a mean follow-up of 8 years).  These reviews
are retrospective, noncontrolled, and are subject to substantial selection
bias.  By contrast, no subset of patients was identified in the
prospective NSABP trial that did not benefit from the addition of radiation
therapy to lumpectomy in the management of DCIS.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="15"/>
</Para><Para id="_80">To determine if tamoxifen adds to the efficacy of local
therapy in the management of DCIS, the NSABP performed a double-blind
prospective trial  (NSABP-B-24) of 1,804 women.<Reference refidx="16"/>  Patients were randomly assigned to
lumpectomy, radiation therapy (50 Gy), and placebo versus lumpectomy, radiation
therapy, and tamoxifen (20 mg/day for 5 years).<Reference refidx="16"/>  Positive or unknown
surgical margins were present in 23% of patients.  Approximately 80% of the
lesions measured not larger than 1 cm,  and more than 80% were detected
mammographically.  Breast cancer events were defined as the presence of new
ipsilateral disease, contralateral disease, or metastases.  Women in the
tamoxifen group had fewer breast cancer events at 5 years than did those on a
placebo (8.2% vs. 13.4%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .009).<Reference refidx="16"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335123">Level of evidence: 1iDii</LOERef>]  With
tamoxifen, ipsilateral invasive breast cancer decreased from 4.2% to 2.1% at 5
years (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .03).  Tamoxifen also decreased the incidence of contralateral breast
neoplasms (invasive and noninvasive) from 0.8% per year to 0.4% per year
(<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .01).  The benefit of tamoxifen extended to those patients with positive or
uncertain margins.<Reference refidx="17"/>  (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062779" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-prevention-pdq">Breast Cancer Prevention</SummaryRef>

In a retrospective series, approximately 32% of patients with ipsilateral supraclavicular node involvement and no evidence of distant metastases (pN3c) had prolonged disease-free survival (DFS) at 10 years with combined modality therapy.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Although these results have not been replicated in another series, this result suggests such patients should be treated with the same intent. </Para><Para id="_653">Initial surgery is generally
limited to biopsy to permit the determination of histology, estrogen-receptor (ER) and progesterone-receptor (PR) levels,

chemotherapy and/or taxane-based therapy is standard.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>  In one series of

patients who respond to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, local therapy may consist of
total mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection followed by postoperative
radiation therapy to the chest wall and regional lymphatics.  Breast-conserving
therapy can be considered in patients with a good partial or complete response
to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Subsequent systemic therapy may consist of
further chemotherapy.  Hormone therapy should be administered to patients whose
tumors are ER-positive or unknown.  All patients should be considered
candidates for clinical trials to evaluate the most appropriate fashion in
which to administer the various components of multimodality regimens.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_297"><Title>Stage IV, Recurrent, and Metastatic Breast Cancer</Title><Para id="_205">Recurrent breast cancer is often responsive to therapy, though treatment is
rarely curative at this stage of disease.  Patients with localized
breast or chest wall recurrences, however,  may be long-term survivors with appropriate
therapy.  Prior to treatment for recurrent or metastatic cancer,
restaging to evaluate extent of disease is indicated.  Cytologic or histologic
documentation of recurrent or metastatic disease should be obtained whenever
possible.  The ER levels and PR levels,
<GeneName>HER2/neu</GeneName> positivity at the time of recurrence, and previous treatment should be
considered, if known, when selecting therapy.  ER status may change at the time
of recurrence.  In a single small study by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (MDA-MBDT-8081), 36% of hormone receptor–positive
tumors were found to be receptor negative in biopsy specimens isolated at the
time of recurrence.<Reference refidx="4"/>  Patients in this study had no interval treatment.  If
ER and PR status is unknown, then the site(s) of recurrence, disease-free
interval, response to previous treatment, and menopausal status are useful in
selecting chemotherapy or hormone therapy.<Reference refidx="5"/>   
</Para><SummarySection id="_206"><Title>Recurrent local-regional breast cancer</Title><Para id="_207">Patients with local-regional breast cancer recurrence may become long-term survivors
with appropriate therapy.   A clinical trial indicated that between 10% and 20%
of patients will have locally recurrent disease in the breast between 1 and 9
years after breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy.<Reference refidx="6"/>  Nine
percent to 25% of these patients will have distant metastases or locally
extensive disease at the time of recurrence.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/>  Patients with local-regional
recurrence should be considered for further local treatment (e.g., mastectomy). 
In one  series, the 5-year actuarial rate of relapse for patients treated for
invasive recurrence after initial breast conservation and radiation therapy was
52%.<Reference refidx="8"/> A phase III, randomized study showed that local control of cutaneous metastases could be achieved with the application of topical miltefosine; however, the drug is not currently available in the United States.<Reference refidx="10"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335131">Level of evidence: 1iiDiii</LOERef>]  
</Para><Para id="_208">Local chest wall recurrence following mastectomy is usually the harbinger of
widespread disease, but, in a subset of patients, it may be the only site of
recurrence.  For patients in this subset, surgery and/or radiation therapy may
be curative.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/>  Patients with chest wall recurrences of less than 3
cm, axillary and internal mammary node recurrence (not
supraclavicular, which has a poorer survival), and a greater than 2-year
disease-free interval prior to recurrence have the best chance for prolonged
survival.<Reference refidx="12"/>  The 5-year disease-free survival DFS rate in one series of such
patients was 25%, with a 10-year rate of 15%.<Reference refidx="13"/>  The local-regional control
rate was 57% at 10 years.  Systemic therapy should be considered in patients

is preferable for first-line treatment is unclear. An Eastern Cooperative Oncology  Intergroup study (E-1193)  randomly assigned patients to receive paclitaxel and doxorubicin given both as a combination and sequentially.<Reference refidx="94"/>  Although response rate and time-to-progression were both better for the combination, survival was the same in both groups.<Reference refidx="94"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335125">Level of evidence: 1iiA</LOERef>];<Reference refidx="95"/><Reference refidx="96"/>  The rate of disease progression,
the presence or absence of comorbid medical conditions, and physician/patient
preference will influence the choice of therapy in individual patients.  At
this time, no data support the superiority of any particular
regimen.  Sequential use of single agents or combinations can be used for
patients who relapse.  Combinations of chemotherapy and hormone therapy have
not shown an OS  advantage over the sequential use of these
agents.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="97"/>
A systematic review of 17 randomized trials found that the addition of one or more chemotherapy drugs to a chemotherapy regimen in the attempt to intensify the treatment improved tumor response but had no effect on OS.<Reference refidx="98"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335125">Level of evidence: 1iiA</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_242">The optimal treatment duration for patients with responsive or stable disease

worse in the immediately treated group.  Similarly, no difference in survival
was noted when patients with partial response or stable disease after initial

lower doses.<Reference refidx="102"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335125">Level of evidence: 1iiA</LOERef>]  These four studies indicate that
different combination regimens of additional chemotherapy immediately following
a patient’s best response to an induction chemotherapy regimen does not improve
OS.  In view of the lack of a standard approach, patients
requiring second-line regimens are good candidates for clinical trials.

and known underlying heart disease.  The cardioprotective drug, dexrazoxane, has
been shown to decrease the risk of doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity in
patients in controlled studies.  The use of this agent has permitted patients
to receive greater cumulative doses of doxorubicin and allowed patients with
cardiac risk factors to receive doxorubicin.<Reference refidx="103"/><Reference refidx="104"/><Reference refidx="105"/><Reference refidx="106"/>  Dexrazoxane has a similar
