It is not approved by the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454785">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</GlossaryTermRef> (FDA)  as a treatment for cancer or any other medical <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000651193">condition</GlossaryTermRef>.  The term “laetrile” comes from 2 words (laevorotatory and mandelonitrile) and is used to describe a purified form of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000643008">chemical</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454511">amygdalin</GlossaryTermRef>.  Amygdalin is a plant compound that contains sugar and produces <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000686192">cyanide</GlossaryTermRef>.   Cyanide is believed to be the active cancer-killing ingredient in laetrile.
 Amygdalin is found in the pits 
of many fruits and in raw nuts.  It is also found in other plants such as lima beans, clover, and sorghum.  </Para><Para id="_9">The names laetrile, Laetrile, and amygdalin are often used  in place of one another,  but they are not the same product.  The chemical make-up of Laetrile patented in the United States is different from the laetrile/amygdalin produced in Mexico.  The patented Laetrile is a  partly <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462950">synthetic</GlossaryTermRef> (man-made)  form of amygdalin, while the laetrile/amygdalin  made in Mexico  comes from crushed apricot pits.  The studies discussed in this fact sheet used either Mexican laetrile/amygdalin or Laetrile.  The <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044672">generic</GlossaryTermRef> term “laetrile” will be used throughout this summary except in cases when the patented version of Laetrile is known to have been used in a study.  </Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_21"><Question>What is the history of the discovery and use of laetrile as a complementary or alternative treatment for cancer?</Question><Answer><Para id="_10">Amygdalin was first isolated in 1830 and was used as an anticancer agent in Russia as early as 1845.  Its first recorded use in the United States as a treatment for cancer was in the 1920s.  The early pill form of amygdalin was  found to be too <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043986">toxic</GlossaryTermRef>, and work with the compound was  stopped.  In the 1950s, a reportedly <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044509">nontoxic</GlossaryTermRef>, 
 partly synthetic form of amygdalin was  made and patented in the United States as Laetrile.  Laetrile gained popularity in the 1970s as a single anticancer agent and as part of a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044057">metabolic therapy</GlossaryTermRef> program  that included a special <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044660">diet</GlossaryTermRef>, high-<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044664">dose</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044744">vitamin</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045916">supplements</GlossaryTermRef>, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046704">pancreatic enzymes</GlossaryTermRef> (a group of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046092">proteins</GlossaryTermRef> that aid in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463707">digestion</GlossaryTermRef> of food).  By 1978, more than 70,000 people in the United States had reportedly been treated with Laetrile. 
</Para><Para id="_40">In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a ban on the shipment of laetrile between states in the United States. It is still used in Mexico and at some clinics in the United States.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_29"><Question>What is the theory behind the claim that laetrile is useful in treating cancer?</Question><Answer><Para id="_30">Cyanide is thought to be the main anticancer ingredient in laetrile. Two other breakdown products of amygdalin, prunasin (which is similar in structure to Laetrile) and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044000">benzaldehyde</GlossaryTermRef>, may also be cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046476">cell</GlossaryTermRef>  blockers.  The following theories have been proposed to support the use of laetrile for cancer:</Para><ItemizedList id="_41" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Two of the theories state that the balance of certain <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046081">enzymes</GlossaryTermRef> in cancer cells allows laetrile to be <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043986">toxic</GlossaryTermRef> to the cancer cells. There is some evidence that normal <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissues</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045772">malignant</GlossaryTermRef> tissues do have different amounts of these enzymes.</ListItem><ListItem>Another theory states that cancer is the result of  a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044744">vitamin</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000321364">deficiency</GlossaryTermRef> and that laetrile, or “vitamin B-17,” is the missing vitamin needed by the body to restore health. There is currently no evidence that laetrile is needed by the body  or that laetrile can act as a vitamin in animals or humans.</ListItem><ListItem>The fourth theory states that the cyanide released by laetrile has a toxic effect that results in killing the cancer cells and stopping them from growing. The theory also states that the damage to the cells causes a boost to the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356">immune system</GlossaryTermRef>.</ListItem></ItemizedList></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_22"><Question>How is laetrile administered?</Question><Answer><Para id="_11">Laetrile is  given by mouth (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044068">orally</GlossaryTermRef>) as a pill.  It can also be given by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044678">injection</GlossaryTermRef> into a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000476471">vein</GlossaryTermRef> (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046682">intravenously</GlossaryTermRef>) or muscle.  Laetrile is commonly given intravenously over a period of time and then orally as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045768">maintenance therapy</GlossaryTermRef> (treatment given to help extend the benefit of previous <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044737">therapy</GlossaryTermRef>).</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_23"><Question>Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using laetrile?</Question><Answer><Para id="_12"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044517">Preclinical studies</GlossaryTermRef> have been  done with laetrile either alone or   combined with other substances.  These studies tested the benefits of laetrile against cancer, the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046580">side effects</GlossaryTermRef> of laetrile treatment, where and how laetrile breaks down in the body, and how laetrile and its breakdown products leave the body.  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044512">Laboratory</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454774">animal studies</GlossaryTermRef> have shown mixed results on the anticancer effects of laetrile (amygdalin).</Para><Para id="_43">Two animal studies of amygdalin by the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044266">National Cancer Institute</GlossaryTermRef> reported  no <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044085">response</GlossaryTermRef> when it was given alone or with an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046081">enzyme</GlossaryTermRef> that activates the release of cyanide from amygdalin in the body. The animals had more side effects when the enzyme was given at the same time as the amygdalin.</Para><Para id="_44">Other studies have reported a response to amygdalin:</Para><ItemizedList id="_45" Style="bullet"><ListItem>One study reported <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumor</GlossaryTermRef> response in mice when amygdalin was given with enzymes and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045248">vitamin A</GlossaryTermRef>, but not when given alone.   </ListItem><ListItem>A second study reported that amygdalin caused <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045993">white blood cells</GlossaryTermRef> to have an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045722">immune response</GlossaryTermRef> against <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000445079">prostate cancer</GlossaryTermRef> cells. </ListItem><ListItem>A third study treated tumor cells with amygdalin and the enzyme that activates the release of cyanide.

</Question><Answer><Para id="_32">No <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044014">controlled clinical trials</GlossaryTermRef> (trials that compare groups of patients who receive the new treatment to groups who do not) of laetrile have been reported.</Para><Para id="_25">Although many <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043995">anecdotal reports</GlossaryTermRef> (incomplete descriptions of the medical/treatment history of one or more patients) and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044007">case reports</GlossaryTermRef> (detailed reports of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046450">diagnosis</GlossaryTermRef>, treatment, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044671">follow-up</GlossaryTermRef> of individual patients) are available, they provide little evidence to support laetrile as a treatment for cancer.</Para><Para id="_33"><Strong>The following has been reported from case series about the use of laetrile in patients with cancer:</Strong></Para><ItemizedList id="_26" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>A <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044006">case series</GlossaryTermRef> (a group or series of case reports involving patients who were given similar treatment) of 44 patients  treated with laetrile was published in 1953. Most of the patients who showed some improvement also received <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044971">radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef> or anticancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000348921">drugs</GlossaryTermRef>, so it is  not known  which treatment produced the benefit. </ListItem><ListItem>In another series of case reports published in 1962, 10 patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044058">metastatic cancer</GlossaryTermRef> (cancer that has spread from one part of the body to another) were treated with a wide range of doses of intravenous Laetrile.  Pain relief was the  main reported benefit.  Reduced swelling of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045762">lymph nodes</GlossaryTermRef> and decreased <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumor</GlossaryTermRef> size were also reported.  Long-term follow-up with these patients was not  done, however, so it is not known how long the benefits lasted after treatment.</ListItem><ListItem><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044000">Benzaldehyde</GlossaryTermRef>, which is   made when laetrile is broken down by the body, has also been tested for anticancer activity in humans.  In two <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044010">clinical series</GlossaryTermRef> (case reports of a number of patients who are treated consecutively in a clinic), patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000478743">advanced cancer</GlossaryTermRef> who had not <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044085">responded</GlossaryTermRef> to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044930">standard therapy</GlossaryTermRef> were treated with benzaldehyde.  Some patients   had a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045652">complete response</GlossaryTermRef> (the disappearance of all signs and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045022">symptoms</GlossaryTermRef> of cancer), while some had a decrease in tumor size.  The responses to benzaldehyde lasted as long as the treatment continued.  Almost all of the patients had been treated previously with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045214">chemotherapy</GlossaryTermRef> or radiation therapy, but it is not known how soon treatment with benzaldehyde began after the other treatment ended.</ListItem><ListItem>In 1978, the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044266">National Cancer Institute</GlossaryTermRef> (NCI) requested case reports from <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463164">practitioners</GlossaryTermRef> who believed their patients  were helped by treatment with laetrile.  Ninety-three cases were submitted; 67 of these were complete enough to be evaluated.  An expert panel concluded that 2 of the 67 patients had complete responses and 4  others had a  decrease in tumor size.   Based on these 6 cases, NCI sponsored <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044195">clinical studies</GlossaryTermRef> with laetrile.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_13">Findings from only 2 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045961">clinical trials</GlossaryTermRef> with laetrile have been published.  These trials, sponsored by NCI, were  done in the late 1970s and early 1980s,  and did not include a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044149">control group</GlossaryTermRef> for comparison.  </Para><Para id="_34"><Strong>The following has been reported from these 2 clinical trials about the use of laetrile in patients with cancer: </Strong></Para><ItemizedList id="_14" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>The first trial, a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045830">phase I study</GlossaryTermRef>, tested  doses, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000346524">schedules</GlossaryTermRef>, and ways to give amygdalin in 6 cancer patients.  Researchers found that amygdalin caused  very few  side effects  when given by mouth or intravenously.  Two patients who ate raw almonds while taking amygdalin, however, developed symptoms of cyanide poisoning.  </ListItem><ListItem>In 1982, a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045831">phase II study</GlossaryTermRef>  with 175 patients looked at which types of cancer might  benefit from  treatment with amygdalin.  Most of the patients in this study had <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000444971">breast</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044237">colon</GlossaryTermRef>, or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000445043">lung cancer</GlossaryTermRef>.  Amygdalin was  given by injection for 21 days, followed by oral maintenance therapy  using doses and procedures similar to those  in the phase I study.  Vitamins and pancreatic enzymes were also given as part of a metabolic therapy program that also included <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044660">dietary</GlossaryTermRef> changes.  One <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000445087">stomach cancer</GlossaryTermRef> patient showed a decrease in tumor size, which was maintained for 10 weeks while the patient was on amygdalin therapy.  In 
 about half of the patients,  cancer  had grown at the end of the treatment.   Cancer had grown in all patients 7 months after completing treatment.  Some patients reported an improvement in their ability to work or do other activities, and other patients said their symptoms improved.  These improvements, however, did not last after treatment ended.

  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_6"><Title>Evaluation of CAM Approaches</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_7">It is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute  and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_8">Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH)  in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.</Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_9"><ExternalRef xref="http://cam.cancer.gov/cam/best_case_intro.html">The NCI Best Case Series Program</ExternalRef>   which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.</Para></SummarySection>
