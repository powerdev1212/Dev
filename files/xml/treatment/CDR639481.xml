In addition, small, indolent GIST, only a few millimeters in diameter, are common in the general population and are not included in cancer registries.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>   GIST are equally distributed across all geographic and ethnic groups and men and women are equally affected.  Most patients present between the ages of 50 and 80.<Reference refidx="6"/>  

The vast majority of GIST are sporadic, but there are rare familial forms associated with the characteristic heritable mutations in the <GeneName>KIT</GeneName> gene (or, rarely, in succinate dehydrogenase genes in Carney-Stratakis syndrome).  Familial GIST may present as multiple primary tumors.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_7"><Title>Clinical Presentation and Diagnostic Evaluation</Title><Para id="_136">GIST can occur anywhere along the GI tract, but most often are found in the stomach or small intestine.

Follow-up recommendations are, therefore, based upon expert opinion and clinical judgment taking into account tumor site, size, and mitotic index.  For surgically treated patients with localized disease, routine follow-up schedules may differ across institutions and may depend on the risk status of the tumor.<Reference refidx="18"/> Abdominal/pelvic CT may be performed every 3 to 6 months, but very low-risk lesions may not need routine follow-up testing.<Reference refidx="18"/></Para><Para id="_86">CT or 18FDG-PET are used to monitor therapeutic effects in patients receiving systemic therapy for unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent disease.<Reference refidx="27"/> 18FDG-PET may also be helpful in detecting resistance to TKI. If 18FDG-PET is used to monitor therapy with a TKI, a baseline FDG-PET is often performed before kinase inhibitor administration. Because 18FDG-PET imaging may detect the activity of imatinib in GIST much earlier than CT imaging, imaging of GIST with 18FDG-PET may represent a useful diagnostic modality for the very early assessment of response to imatinib therapy; a decrease in tumor avidity for 18FDG may be detected as early as 24 hours after a single dose of imatinib.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_186"><Title>Related Summary</Title><Para id="_187">(Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062872#_113" url="/types/childhood-cancers/hp/unusual-cancers-childhood-pdq">Abdominal Cancers</SummaryRef> section in the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062872" url="/types/childhood-cancers/hp/unusual-cancers-childhood-pdq">Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment</SummaryRef> for information on gastrointestinal stromal tumors in children.)</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="17761719">Judson I, Demetri G: Advances in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours.

Because GIST rarely involve the locoregional lymph nodes, extensive lymph node resection or resection is rarely indicated. These tumors may have fragile pseudocapsules, so care must be taken to avoid rupturing the pseudocapsule during surgery, which could result in peritoneal dissemination.</ListItem><ListItem>	Therapy with postoperative adjuvant imatinib for GIST patients with completely resected localized disease is under investigation. This is a very heterogeneous population in terms of risk of relapse and death after surgical resection (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000639481#_192" url="/types/soft-tissue-sarcoma/hp/gist-treatment-pdq">Table 1</SummaryRef>).  Depending on mitotic count, tumor size, and tumor site, the risk of relapse after complete gross resection may be considerable. Results from two trials  suggest that adjuvant imatinib reduces recurrence after complete resection of localized, primary GIST.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> However, it is not clear whether improvements in recurrence with adjuvant therapy will translate into improved survival.  In addition, the optimal duration of adjuvant imatinib is unknown.<Para id="_153">In a single-arm, open-label, phase II multicenter study (<ProtocolRef href="CDR0000068942" nct_id="NCT00025246">ACOSOG-Z9000</ProtocolRef>), patients underwent complete gross resection of KIT-expressing primary GIST that were at high risk of recurrence (tumor size &gt;10 cm, tumor rupture, or &lt;5 peritoneal metastases) and received a daily dose of imatinib for 1 year. One hundred and seven patients with gastric (50%) and intestinal (42%) GIST and a median tumor size of 13 cm were evaluable with a median follow-up of 4 years. The 1-, 2- and 3-year rates for overall survival (OS) were 99%, 97%, and 97%, respectively, while the 1-, 2- and 3-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rates were 94%, 73%, and 61%, respectively.<Reference refidx="4"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335158">Level of evidence: 3iiiDiii</LOERef>] </Para><Para id="_95">In one randomized, double-blinded phase III trial (<ProtocolRef href="CDR0000069452" nct_id="NCT00041197">ACOSOG-Z9001</ProtocolRef>), 713 patients who had undergone complete gross resection of a primary GIST measuring at least 3 cm and expressing KIT had been treated with 1 year of imatinib (400 mg daily) or placebo.<Reference refidx="3"/> The original primary endpoint of the trial was OS.  However, when the overall death rate from GIST was shown to  be low because  of  the efficacy of imatinib for advanced or recurrent disease, the investigators changed the endpoint to RFS. The trial was subsequently stopped early because of an interim analysis, which showed  that patients who had been assigned to the imatinib arm experienced a 1-year RFS of 98%, whereas those assigned  to the placebo arm had a 1-year RFS of 83% (overall HR = 0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.22–0.53; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .0001). Since quality of life (QoL) was not measured in the study, it was  not clear whether delayed RFS translated into improved patient QoL.

It is possible that imatinib was simply delaying recurrences that could have been treated equally well at relapse in those patients who had a recurrence of their tumors.  In fact, the RFS curves appeared to  converge after about 30 months of follow-up.  The question of whether RFS will translate into improved OS may be answered by an ongoing Intergroup trial (<ProtocolRef href="CDR0000410825" nct_id="NCT00103168">EORTC-62024</ProtocolRef>) in which patients are randomly assigned to 2 years of adjuvant imatinib versus observation, with OS as the primary endpoint. </Para><Para id="_154">Given the current uncertainties about the overall impact of adjuvant imatinib, shared decision making with the patient is important.
