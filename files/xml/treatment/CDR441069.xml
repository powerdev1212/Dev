Some studies  have tested the effects of essential oils on mood, alertness, and mental stress in healthy subjects.  Other studies investigated the effects of various (usually synthetic) odors on task performance, reaction time, and autonomic parameters or evaluated the direct effects of odors on the brain via <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462676">electroencephalogram</GlossaryTermRef> patterns and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044946">functional imaging</GlossaryTermRef> studies.<Reference refidx="7"/>   Such studies have consistently shown that odors can produce specific effects on human neuropsychological and autonomic function and that odors can influence mood, perceived health, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463165">arousal</GlossaryTermRef>.  These studies suggest that odors may have therapeutic applications  in the context of stressful and adverse psychological conditions.</Para><Para id="_27"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463164">Practitioners</GlossaryTermRef> of aromatherapy apply essential oils using several different  methods, including (1) indirect <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044600">inhalation</GlossaryTermRef> via a  room diffuser or drops of oil placed near the patient (e.g., on a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissue</GlossaryTermRef>), (2) direct inhalation used in an individual inhaler      (e.g.,       a few drops of essential oil floated on top of hot water to aid a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000641960">sinus</GlossaryTermRef> headache), or        (3) <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462663">aromatherapy massage</GlossaryTermRef>, which is the application to the body of essential oils diluted in a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462669">carrier oil</GlossaryTermRef>. Other direct and indirect applications include mixing essential oils in bath salts and lotions or applying them to dressings.  Different aromatherapy practitioners  may have different recipes for treating specific  conditions, involving various combinations of oils and methods of application.  Differences seem to be  practitioner-dependent, with some common uses more accepted throughout the aromatherapy community.  Training and certification in aromatherapy for lay practitioners is available at several schools throughout the United States and United Kingdom,    but there is no professional standardization   in the United States,  and no license is required to practice in either country.  Thus, there is little consistency in the specific 
treatments used  for specific illnesses among practitioners.  This lack of standardization has led to poor consistency in research on the effects of aromatherapy, because  anecdotal evidence alone or previous experience has driven the choice of oils, and different researchers often choose different oils when studying the same applications.  However, there are now specific courses for licensed health professionals that give nursing or continuing medical education contact hours, including a small research component and  information on evaluating/measuring outcomes.</Para><Para id="_96"> The National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy (NAHA) (<ExternalRef xref="http://www.naha.org/">www.naha.org/</ExternalRef>) and the Alliance of International Aromatherapists    (<ExternalRef xref="http://www.alliance-aromatherapists.org/">www.alliance-aromatherapists.org</ExternalRef>) are the two governing bodies for national educational standards for aromatherapists.  NAHA is taking steps toward standardizing aromatherapy certification in the United States.  Many schools offer certificate programs approved by NAHA.            A list of these schools can be found on the NAHA Web site  (<ExternalRef xref="http://www.naha.org/schools_level_one_two.htm">www.naha.org/schools_level_one_two.htm</ExternalRef>).

Nonmedical use of essential oils is common in the flavoring and fragrance industries.

The current applications of aromatherapy did not come about until the early 20th century when the French chemist and perfumer Rene Gattefosse coined the term “aromatherapy” and published a book of that name in 1937.<Reference refidx="2"/>  Gattefosse proposed the use of aromatherapy to treat diseases in virtually every <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000257523">organ</GlossaryTermRef> system, citing mostly <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043995">anecdotal</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044007">case-based evidence</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_30">Although Gattefosse and his colleagues in France, Italy, and Germany studied the effects of aromatherapy for some 30 years, its use went out of fashion midcentury and was rediscovered by another Frenchman, a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000390246">physician</GlossaryTermRef>, Jean Valnet, in the latter part of the century.  Valnet published his book <Emphasis>The Practice of Aromatherapy</Emphasis> in 1982,<Reference refidx="3"/>  at which time the practice became more well-known in Britain and the United States.  Through the 1980s and 1990s, as patients in Western countries became increasingly interested in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044964">complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)</GlossaryTermRef> treatments, aromatherapy developed a following that continues to this day.  In addition to the growing use of essential oils by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000269445">nurses</GlossaryTermRef> and aromatherapy <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463164">practitioners</GlossaryTermRef> for specific medical issues, the popularity of aromatherapy has also been exploited by cosmetics companies that have created lines of essential oil-based (though often with a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462950">synthetic</GlossaryTermRef> component) cosmetics and toiletries, claiming to improve mood and well-being in their users.</Para><Para id="_31">Despite the growing popularity of aromatherapy in the latter part of the 20th century (especially in the United Kingdom), little research on aromatherapy was available in the English-language medical literature until the early or mid-1990s.  The research that began to appear in the 1990s was most often conducted by nurses, who tended to be the primary practitioners of aromatherapy in the United States and United Kingdom (although it is dispensed by medical doctors in France and Germany).  Aromatherapists now publish their own journal, the <Emphasis>International Journal of Essential Oil Therapeutics</Emphasis>.      Also, many studies regarding the effects of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462689">odor</GlossaryTermRef> on the brain and other systems in animals and healthy humans have been published in the context of odor psychology and neurobiology (and in the absence of the specific term aromatherapy).</Para><Para id="_32">In addition to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045927">topical</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462661">antimicrobial</GlossaryTermRef> uses,<Reference refidx="4"/> aromatherapy has also been proposed for use in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000441269">wound</GlossaryTermRef> care <Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>  and to treat a variety of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045754">localized</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045022">symptoms</GlossaryTermRef> and illnesses such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044642">alopecia</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462675">eczema</GlossaryTermRef>, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000446534">pruritus</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/> Aromatherapy has also been studied via <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044600">inhalation</GlossaryTermRef> for airway reactivity.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_33">Studies on aromatherapy have examined a variety of other conditions:  sedation and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463165">arousal</GlossaryTermRef>;<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/> startle reflex and reaction time;<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/>  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454766">psychological</GlossaryTermRef> states such as mood, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000430405">anxiety</GlossaryTermRef>, and general sense of well-being;<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/> psychiatric disorders;<Reference refidx="30"/> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044117">neurologic</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454756">impairment</GlossaryTermRef>;<Reference refidx="23"/> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045641">chronic</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462925">renal failure</GlossaryTermRef>;<Reference refidx="24"/> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462659">agitation</GlossaryTermRef> in patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462672">dementia</GlossaryTermRef>;<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/><Reference refidx="35"/> smoking withdrawal <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045022">symptoms</GlossaryTermRef>;<Reference refidx="36"/><Reference refidx="37"/> motion sickness;<Reference refidx="38"/> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043980">postoperative</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000390302">nausea</GlossaryTermRef>;<Reference refidx="39"/><Reference refidx="40"/> nausea and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000256560">emesis</GlossaryTermRef> in combination with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000321374">fatigue</GlossaryTermRef>, pain, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000430405">anxiety</GlossaryTermRef> in patients in labor;<Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="41"/> pain alone;<Reference refidx="42"/><Reference refidx="43"/><Reference refidx="44"/><Reference refidx="45"/> and pain in combination with other symptoms.<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/></Para><Para id="_34">Published articles have described the use of aromatherapy in specific hospital settings such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef> wards, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044182">hospices</GlossaryTermRef>, and other areas where patients are critically ill and require <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000269448">palliative care</GlossaryTermRef> for pain, nausea, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045359">lymphedema</GlossaryTermRef>,<Reference refidx="46"/><Reference refidx="47"/>         generalized <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000450122">stress</GlossaryTermRef>,  anxiety,<Reference refidx="48"/> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000430479">depression</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="49"/> These <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000286105">observational studies</GlossaryTermRef> provide examples of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044168">clinical</GlossaryTermRef> uses of aromatherapy (and other CAM <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000270868">modalities</GlossaryTermRef>), though they are generally not evidence-based.

Proponents of aromatherapy often cite the connection between <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462691">olfaction</GlossaryTermRef> and the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462685">limbic system</GlossaryTermRef> in the brain as the basis for the effects of aromatherapy on mood and emotions; less is said about proposed mechanisms for its effects on other parts of the body.  Most of the aromatherapy literature, however, lacks in-depth neurophysiological studies on the nature of olfaction and its link to the limbic system, and it generally does not cite research that shows these links.  Proponents of aromatherapy also believe that the effects of the treatments are based on the special nature of the essential oils used and that essential oils produce effects on the body that are greater than the sum of the individual <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000643008">chemical</GlossaryTermRef> components of the scents.

The authors do not comment on the presumed mechanism for this effect, though they suggest that the difference in results between the different oils (some of which were found to be stimulating, some sedative) is related to the “different chemical structures of the compounds…and functional groups…indicating the essential role of the volatility of the fragrance compounds and its <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044225">bioavailability</GlossaryTermRef>."

Although no more effective than placebo, parents receiving aromatherapy showed a significant decrease in their transitory anxiety during the period between the completion of their child’s infusion and 1 hour following infusion. Nausea and pain subsided over the course of the intervention for all children, though nausea remained significantly greater in patients receiving aromatherapy.

Several oils have been approved for use as food additives and are classified as GRAS (generally recognized as safe)  by the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454785">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</GlossaryTermRef>;  however, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044100">ingestion</GlossaryTermRef> of large amounts of essential oils is not recommended.  In addition, a few cases of contact <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045667">dermatitis</GlossaryTermRef> have been reported, mostly in aromatherapists who have had prolonged skin contact with oils in the context of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462663">aromatherapy massage</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="1"/> Some essential oils (e.g., <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044001">camphor</GlossaryTermRef> oil) can cause local irritation; therefore, care should be taken when applying them.  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462755">Phototoxicity</GlossaryTermRef> has occurred when essential oils (particularly citrus oils) are applied directly to the skin before sun exposure.  One <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044007">case report</GlossaryTermRef> also showed airborne contact dermatitis in the context of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044600">inhaled</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462662">aromatherapy</GlossaryTermRef> without massage.<Reference refidx="2"/>  Often, aromatherapy uses undefined mixtures of essential oils without specifying the plant sources. <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000443292">Allergic reactions</GlossaryTermRef> are sometimes reported, especially following <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045927">topical</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000478733">administration</GlossaryTermRef>.  As essential oils age, they are often oxidized so the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000643008">chemical</GlossaryTermRef> composition changes. Individual <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454766">psychological</GlossaryTermRef> associations with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462689">odors</GlossaryTermRef> may result in adverse <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044085">responses</GlossaryTermRef>.                         Repeated exposure to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462684">lavender</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462961">tea tree</GlossaryTermRef> oils by topical administration was shown in one study to be associated with reversible prepubertal gynecomastia.<Reference refidx="3"/> The effects appear to have been caused by the purported weak estrogenic and antiandrogenic activities of lavender and tea tree oils.  Therefore,  avoiding these two essential oils is recommended in patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046076">estrogen</GlossaryTermRef>-dependant <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumors</GlossaryTermRef>.
