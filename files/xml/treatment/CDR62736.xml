patients.  The growth and spread of cancer, as well as its treatment,
contribute to these conditions.
</Para><Para id="_3">Constipation is the slow movement of feces through the large intestine that
results in the passage of dry, hard stool.  This can result in discomfort or
pain.<Reference refidx="1"/>  The longer the transit time of stool in the large intestine, the
greater the fluid absorption and the drier and harder the stool becomes.
</Para><Para id="_145">Inactivity, immobility, or physical and social
impediments (particularly inconvenient bathroom availability) can contribute to
constipation.  Depression and anxiety caused by cancer treatment or cancer pain
can lead to constipation.  Perhaps the most common causes of constipation are inadequate fluid intake and pain
medications; however, these causes are manageable.</Para><Para id="_4">Constipation may be annoying and uncomfortable, but fecal impaction can be
life-threatening.  Impaction refers to the accumulation of dry, hardened feces
in the rectum or colon.  The patient with a fecal impaction may present with
circulatory, cardiac, or respiratory symptoms rather than with gastrointestinal 
symptoms.<Reference refidx="2"/>  If the fecal impaction is not recognized, the signs and symptoms
may progress and result in death.
</Para><Para id="_5">In contrast to constipation or impaction, an intestinal obstruction is a
partial or complete occlusion of the bowel lumen by a process other than fecal
impaction.  Intestinal obstructions can be classified by the following three means:</Para><ItemizedList id="_295" Style="bullet"><ListItem>The type
of obstruction.</ListItem><ListItem>The obstructing mechanism.</ListItem><ListItem> The part of the bowel involved.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_6">Structural disorders, such as intraluminal and extraluminal bowel lesions
caused by primary or metastatic tumor, postoperative adhesions, volvulus of the
bowel, or incarcerated hernia, affect peristalsis and the maintenance of normal
bowel function.  These disorders can lead to total or partial obstruction of
the bowel.  Patients who have colostomies are at special risk of developing
constipation.  If stool is not passed on a regular basis (once a day
to several times a day), further investigation is warranted.  A partial or
complete blockage may have occurred, particularly if no flatus has been
passed.<Reference refidx="3"/>
</Para><Para id="_147">Diarrhea can occur throughout the continuum of cancer care, and the effects can be physically and emotionally devastating.  Although less prevalent than constipation, diarrhea remains a significant symptom burden for people with cancer.   Diarrhea can do the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_296" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Alter dietary patterns.</ListItem><ListItem>Trigger dehydration.</ListItem><ListItem>Create electrolyte imbalance.</ListItem><ListItem>Impair function.</ListItem><ListItem>Cause fatigue.</ListItem><ListItem>Impair skin integrity.</ListItem><ListItem>Limit activity.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_297">Diarrhea, in some cases, can be life-threatening.  Furthermore, diarrhea can lead to increased caregiver burden.</Para><Para id="_298">Specific definitions of diarrhea vary widely.  Acute diarrhea is generally considered to be an abnormal increase in stool liquid that lasts more than 4 days but less than 2 weeks.  Another definition suggests that diarrhea is an increase in stool liquidity (&gt;300 mL of stool) and frequency (the passage of  more than three unformed stools) during a 24-hour period.<Reference refidx="4"/> Diarrhea is considered chronic when it persists longer than 2 months.</Para><Para id="_191">Radiation enteritis is a functional disorder of the large and small bowel that
occurs during or after a course of radiation therapy to the abdomen,
pelvis, or rectum.</Para><Para id="_192">The large and small bowel are very sensitive to ionizing radiation.  Although
the probability of tumor control increases with the radiation dose, so does the
damage to normal tissues.  Acute side effects to the intestines occur at
approximately 10 Gy.  Because curative doses for many abdominal or pelvic
tumors range between 50 and 75 Gy, enteritis is likely to occur.<Reference refidx="5"/>

</ItemizedList><Para id="_36"><Note>*Frequently seen in oncology patients.</Note></Para><Para id="_37">Constipation is frequently the result of autonomic neuropathy caused by the
vinca alkaloids, taxanes, and thalidomide.  Other drugs such as opioid
analgesics or anticholinergics (antidepressants and antihistamines) may lead to
constipation by causing decreased sensitivity to the defecation reflexes and
decreased gut motility.  Since constipation is common with the use of opioids,
a bowel regimen will be initiated at the time opioids are prescribed and
continued for as long as the patient takes opioids.  Opioids produce varying
degrees of constipation, suggesting a dose-related phenomenon. One study suggests that clinicians should not base laxative prescribing on the opioid dose, but rather titrate the laxative according to bowel function.  Lower doses of opioids or weaker opioids, such as codeine, are just as likely to cause constipation.<Reference refidx="2"/> (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062738#_169" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/pain/pain-hp-pdq">Side Effects of Opioids</SummaryRef> section in the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062738" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/pain/pain-hp-pdq">Pain</SummaryRef> for more information.)
</Para><Para id="_38">Other diseases, such as diabetes (with autonomic neuropathy) and hypothyroidism,
may cause constipation.  Metabolic disorders, such as hypokalemia and
hypercalcemia, also predispose cancer patients to developing constipation.  Once
these disorders are corrected, constipation will subside.<Reference refidx="1"/>
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_39"><Title>Assessment of Constipation</Title><Para id="_40">A normal bowel pattern is having at least three stools per week and
no more than three per day; however, these criteria may be inappropriate for cancer
patients.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="3"/>  Constipation is viewed as a subjective symptom involving
the complaints of decreased frequency with incomplete passage of dry, hard
stool.  A thorough history of the patient’s bowel pattern, dietary changes, and
medications, along with a physical examination, can identify possible causes of
constipation.  The evaluation also includes assessment of associated
symptoms such as distention, flatus, cramping, or rectal fullness.  A digital
rectal examination is done to rule out fecal impaction at the
level of the rectum.  A test for occult blood will be helpful in determining a
possible intraluminal lesion.  A thorough examination of the gastrointestinal
tract is necessary if cancer is suspected.<Reference refidx="4"/>
</Para><Para id="_41">The following questions may provide a useful assessment guide:
</Para><OrderedList id="_97" Style="Arabic" Compact="No"><ListItem>What is normal for the patient (frequency, amount, and timing)?</ListItem><ListItem>When was the last bowel movement?  What was the amount, consistency, and
color?  Was blood passed with it?</ListItem><ListItem>Has the patient been having any abdominal discomfort, cramping, nausea or
vomiting, pain, excessive gas, or rectal fullness?</ListItem><ListItem>Does the patient regularly use laxatives or enemas?  What does the patient
usually do to relieve constipation?  Does it usually work?</ListItem><ListItem>What type of diet does the patient follow?  How much and what type of fluids
are taken on a regular basis?</ListItem><ListItem>What medication (dose and frequency) is the patient taking?</ListItem><ListItem>Is this symptom a recent change?</ListItem><ListItem>How many times a day is flatus passed?</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_50">Physical assessment will determine the presence or absence of bowel sounds,
flatus, or abdominal distention.  Patients with colostomies are assessed for constipation.  Dietary habits, fluid intake, activity levels, and
use of opioids in these patients are examined.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_51"><Title>Management of Constipation</Title><Para id="_52">Comprehensive management of constipation includes prevention (if possible),
elimination of causative factors, and judicious use of laxatives.  Some
patients can be encouraged to increase dietary fiber (fruits; green, leafy
vegetables; 100% whole-grain cereals and breads; and bran) and to increase fluid intake
to one-half ounce per pound of body weight daily (if not contraindicated by
renal or heart disease). (Refer to the PDQ summary on  <SummaryRef href="CDR0000276584" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/appetite-loss/nutrition-hp-pdq">Nutrition in Cancer Care</SummaryRef> for more information.) A study that involved geriatric patients compared the
efficacy, cost, and ease of administration of a natural laxative mixture
(raisins, currants, prunes, figs, dates, and prune concentrate) with protocols
using stool softeners, lactulose, and other laxatives.  Results indicated lower
costs, more natural and regular bowel movements, and increased ease of
administration with natural laxatives.  Even though generalization from these
findings was limited by small sample size, additional exploration of natural
laxatives in cancer patient populations might be useful.<Reference refidx="5"/>  A program for
prevention of constipation in cancer patients is described below.</Para><ItemizedList id="_98" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListTitle>Assessment:</ListTitle><ListItem>Establish the patient’s normal bowel pattern and habits (time of day for
normal bowel movement, consistency, color, and amount).

</ListItem>
<ListItem>Encourage regular exercise, including abdominal exercises in bed or moving

</ListItem>

<ListItem>Encourage adequate fiber intake. Experts recommend that:<ItemizedList id="_262" Style="dash" Compact="No"><ListItem>Healthy adults consume 20 g to 35 g of
fiber per day (average consumption is 11 g).</ListItem><ListItem>Children and adolescents consume the number of grams of fiber equal to their age plus 5—for example, a 10-year-old consumes 15 g of fiber per day (10 + 5). This guideline applies until age 18 years; at that time, the adult recommendations are followed.<Para id="_263">While there are no
specific fiber recommendations for cancer patients, they are
encouraged to eat more high-fiber foods such as fruits (e.g., raisins,
prunes, peaches, and apples), vegetables (e.g., squash, broccoli, carrots,
and celery), and 100% whole-grain cereals, breads, and bran.  Increased fiber
intake must be accompanied by increased fluid intake, or constipation may
result.  High fiber intake is contraindicated in patients at increased
risk for bowel obstruction, such as those with a history of bowel
obstruction or status postcolostomy.</Para></ListItem></ItemizedList></ListItem><ListItem>Provide a warm or hot drink approximately one-half hour before time of
patient’s usual defecation.
</ListItem>
<ListItem>Provide privacy and quiet time at the patient’s usual or planned time for  
defecation.

the drugs that contribute most to the development of constipation and
impaction.  Repeated and escalating dosing of laxatives renders the colon less
sensitive to its intrinsic reflexes stimulated by distention. (Refer to the
<SummaryRef href="CDR0000062736#_9" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/constipation/GI-complications-hp-pdq">Etiology of Constipation</SummaryRef> section of this summary for causes of constipation that may lead to  impaction.)</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_72"><Title>Signs and Symptoms of Impaction</Title><Para id="_73">The patient may exhibit symptoms similar to constipation or present with
symptoms unrelated to the gastrointestinal system.  If the impaction presses on
the sacral nerves, the patient may experience back pain.  If the impaction
presses on the ureters, bladder, or urethra, urinary symptoms can develop. 
These symptoms include increased or decreased frequency or urgency of
urination, or urinary retention.
</Para><Para id="_74">When abdominal distention occurs, movement of the diaphragm is compromised,
leading to insufficient aeration with subsequent hypoxia and left ventricular
dysfunction.  Hypoxia can, in turn, precipitate angina or tachycardia.  If the
vasovagal response is stimulated by the pressure of impaction, the patient may
become dizzy and hypotensive.
</Para><Para id="_75">Movement of stool around the impaction may result in diarrhea, which can be
explosive.  Coughing or activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure may
cause leakage of stool.  The leakage may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain, and dehydration and is virtually diagnostic of the condition. 
Thus, the patient with an impaction may present in an acutely confused and
disoriented state, with signs of tachycardia, diaphoresis, fever, elevated or
low blood pressure, and/or abdominal fullness or rigidity.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_76"><Title>Assessment of Impaction</Title><Para id="_77">Assessment includes the questions discussed previously for the patient with
constipation. (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062736#_39" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/constipation/GI-complications-hp-pdq">Assessment of Constipation</SummaryRef> section of this summary for the list of questions.)  Additional
assessment includes auscultation of bowel sounds to determine if they are
present, absent, hyperactive, or hypoactive.  The abdomen is inspected
for distention and gently palpated for any masses, rigidity, or tenderness.  A
rectal examination will determine the presence of stool in the rectum or
sigmoid colon.  An abdominal x-ray (flat and upright) would show loss of haustral
markings, gas patterns reflecting gross amounts of stool, and dilatation
proximal to the impaction.<Reference refidx="2"/>
</Para><Para id="_78">If a diagnosis of fecal impaction is uncertain, a laboratory workup can rule
out other problems.  A complete blood cell count, appropriate blood
chemistries, chest x-ray, and an electrocardiogram can be performed.  If the
patient has become dehydrated, the blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and serum
osmolality will be elevated.  There may be an elevation of the hemoglobin and
hematocrit indicating hemoconcentration.  The white blood cell (WBC) count may
be slightly elevated in the presence of a fever.  If the WBC count is extremely
elevated and the patient is exhibiting a high fever and abdominal pain, an
obstruction, perforation, infection, or inflammatory process must be ruled out. 
With marked distention of the cecum (diameter ≥12 cm), there is a risk
of bowel perforation.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_79"><Title>Treatment of Impaction</Title><Para id="_80">The primary treatment of impaction is to hydrate and soften the stool so that
it can be removed or passed.  Enemas  (oil retention, tap water, or
hypertonic phosphate) lubricate the bowel and soften the stool.  Caution must
be exercised; fecal impaction can irritate the bowel wall, and enemas in excess
may perforate the bowel.  The patient may need to be digitally disimpacted if
the stool is within reach.  This is best done after administering an enema to
lubricate the bowel.
</Para><Para id="_81">Nonstimulating bowel softeners such as docusate can be used to help soften
stool higher in the colon.  Mineral or olive oil can be given to loosen the
stool.  Caution is used when giving docusate sodium with mineral oil
because there could be an increased systemic absorption of the mineral oil
leading to systemic lipid granulomas.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Glycerin suppositories can also be
used.  Any laxatives that might stimulate the bowel or cause cramping are
avoided so that the bowel is not damaged further.

determine where the obstruction is located.  While it remains controversial, an
upper gastrointestinal series is contraindicated with an acutely presenting
obstruction because it can cause a partial obstruction to become complete or

of the unabsorbed secretions produce nausea, vomiting, pain, and colicky
activity as a consequence of the partial or complete occlusion of the lumen. 
In this case, a gastrostomy tube is commonly used to provide decompression of
 air and fluid that may be accumulating and   causing  visceral distention and
pain.  The gastrostomy tube is placed into the stomach and is attached to a drainage bag
that can be easily concealed under clothing.  When the valve between the
gastrostomy tube and the bag is open, the patient may be able to eat or drink
by mouth without creating discomfort since the food is drained directly into
the bag.  Dietary discretion is advised to minimize the risk of tube
obstruction by solid food.  If the obstruction improves, the valve can be
closed and the patient may once again benefit from enteral nutrition.
</Para><Para id="_96">Sometimes, decompression is difficult even with a gastrostomy tube in place. 
This problem may be caused by the accumulation of fluid, since several liters of
gastrointestinal secretions may be produced per day.  To relieve continuous abdominal
pain, opioid analgesics via continuous subcutaneous or intravenous infusion may
be necessary.  Effective antispasmodics in this situation include
anticholinergics (such as hyoscine butylbromide) <Reference refidx="21"/> and possibly
corticosteroids as well as centrally acting agents.   If the bowel obstruction
is thought to be functional (rather than mechanical) in origin, metoclopramide
is the drug of choice because of its prokinetic effects on the bowel.  For complete
bowel obstruction thought to be irreversible, a trial of an antispasmodic such
as hyoscyamine may decrease bowel contractions and therefore yield pain
relief.  Another option for management of refractory pain and/or nausea is the
synthetic somatostatin analog octreotide.  This agent inhibits the release of
several gastrointestinal hormones and reduces gastrointestinal
secretions.<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]<Reference refidx="24"/> </Para><Para id="_309">Octreotide is usually given subcutaneously at 50 to 200 µg

develop chronic radiation enteritis.  Signs and symptoms include the following: </Para><ItemizedList id="_329" Style="bullet">

abdominal pain.</ListItem><ListItem> Bloody diarrhea.</ListItem><ListItem>Tenesmus.</ListItem><ListItem>Steatorrhea.</ListItem><ListItem>Weight loss.</ListItem><ListItem>Nausea

and massive rectal bleeding.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_331">The initial signs and symptoms occur  6
to 18 months after radiation therapy.  Radiologic findings include
submucosal thickening, single or multiple stenoses, adhesions, and sinus or
fistula formation.<Reference refidx="9"/>  Microscopic findings include villi that are fibrotic or
may be lost altogether.  Ulceration is common, varying from simple loss of
epithelial layers to ulcers that may penetrate to different depths of the
intestinal wall, even to the serosa.  Lymphatic tissue is often atrophic or
absent.  The submucosa is severely diseased.  Arterioles and small arteries
show profound changes, with hyalinization of the entire wall thickness.  The
muscularis is often distorted or focally replaced by fibrosis.</Para><Para id="_221">The diagnosis of chronic radiation enteritis may be difficult to make.
Clinically and radiologically recurrent tumor needs to be ruled out.  Because of
the possible latency of the illness, it is essential that the physician obtain
a detailed history of the patient's radiation therapy course.  It is
often advisable to include the radiation therapy physician in the continued
management of the patient's care.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_222"><Title>Treatment</Title><Para id="_223">Medical management of the patient's symptoms (which are similar to symptoms of acute
radiation enteritis) is indicated, with surgical management reserved for severe
damage.<Reference refidx="7"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]  Fewer than 2% of the 5% to 15% of patients who received abdominal or
pelvic radiation will require surgical intervention.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_224">The timing and choice of surgical techniques remains somewhat controversial.  A
lower operative mortality (21% vs. 10%) and incidence of anatomic dehiscence
(36% vs. 6%) have been reported with intestinal bypass as compared with resection.<Reference refidx="11"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]<Reference refidx="12"/>   Those who favor resection point out that the removal of diseased bowel
decreases the mortality rate for resection and is comparable to the bypass
procedure.<Reference refidx="11"/>  All agree that simple lysis of adhesions is inadequate and that
fistulas require bypass.
</Para><Para id="_225">Surgery is undertaken only  after careful assessment of the patient's
clinical condition and extent of radiation damage because wound healing is
often delayed, necessitating prolonged parenteral feeding after surgery.  Even
after apparently successful operations, symptoms may persist in a significant
