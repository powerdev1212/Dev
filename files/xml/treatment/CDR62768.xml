the cranial-spinal axis without systemic disease.  An increasing incidence of
this disease has been seen among patients with AIDS and among other immunocompromised persons.  The natural history
of this disorder differs between patients with AIDS and those without AIDS. 
Computed tomographic (CT) scans may show ring enhancement in 50% of AIDS patients while patients without AIDS almost always show only homogeneous
enhancement.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Both groups do equally poorly without therapy (1–3 month mean
survival), but the overall survival for treated patients is much better for
patients without AIDS (18.9 months) than for those with AIDS (2.6 months).<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>

decompression with partial or gross total removal of the tumor is of no benefit
to the patient.  Median survival with surgery alone is in the range of only 1 to 5
months.  Until the mid-1990s, radiation therapy had been the standard treatment,
with doses of up to 45 Gy using standard fractionation. A prospective trial by the Radiation
Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG-8315) used 40 Gy whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and a 20 Gy boost to
the tumor and found that the results were no better than had been previously reported with
a median survival of 1 year and 28% of the patients surviving 2 years.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>  Disease recurs in
the brain in 92% of patients despite high doses of radiation.  The addition
of spinal-axis radiation does not affect survival because it does not prevent
cerebral relapse.
