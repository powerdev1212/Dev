to describe a purified form of the chemical <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454511">amygdalin</GlossaryTermRef>, a 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044018">cyanogenic glucoside</GlossaryTermRef> (a
plant compound that contains sugar and produces cyanide) found in the pits of
many fruits and raw nuts and in other plants, such as lima beans, clover, and
sorghum.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>  In the 1970s, laetrile gained popularity as an
anticancer agent.  By 1978, more than 70,000 individuals in the United States
were reported to have been treated with it.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/>  Laetrile has
been used for <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef> treatment both as a single agent and in combination with
a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044057">metabolic therapy</GlossaryTermRef> program
that consists of a specialized diet, high-dose <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044744">vitamin</GlossaryTermRef> supplements, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046704">pancreatic enzymes</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_7">In the United States, researchers must file an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000762975">Investigational New Drug</GlossaryTermRef>
(IND) application with the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454785">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</GlossaryTermRef> (FDA) to conduct
drug research in human subjects.  In 1970, an IND
application to study laetrile was filed by the McNaughton Foundation (San Ysidro,
California).  This request was initially approved but later rejected because 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044517">preclinical</GlossaryTermRef> evidence in animals showed that laetrile was not likely to be
effective as an anticancer agent,<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/> and because there were
questions about how the proposed study was to be conducted.<Reference refidx="13"/> 
Laetrile supporters viewed this reversal as an attempt by the U.S.               government
to block access to new and promising cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044737">therapies</GlossaryTermRef>, and pressure mounted to
make laetrile available to the public.  Court cases in Oklahoma,
Massachusetts, New Jersey, and California challenged the FDA’s role in
determining which drugs should be available to cancer patients.  Consequently,
laetrile was legalized in more than 20 states during the 1970s.  In 1980, the
U.S. Supreme Court acted to uphold a federal ban on interstate shipment of laetrile.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="14"/>  As a result, the
use of laetrile has greatly diminished, but
 the compound continues to be manufactured and administered as an anticancer therapy,
primarily in Mexico, and in some clinics in the United States. </Para><Para id="_8"> Although the names laetrile, Laetrile, and amygdalin are often used
interchangeably, they are not the same product.  The chemical composition of
U.S.-patented Laetrile (mandelonitrile-beta-glucuronide), a semisynthetic 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044022">derivative</GlossaryTermRef> of amygdalin, is different
from the laetrile/amygdalin produced in Mexico (mandelonitrile
beta-D-gentiobioside), which is made from crushed apricot pits.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/>  Mandelonitrile, which contains cyanide, is a structural component of
both products.<Reference refidx="15"/>  It has been proposed that cyanide is the
active cancer-killing ingredient in laetrile, but  two other breakdown products
of amygdalin—prunasin (which is similar in structure to Laetrile) and 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044000">benzaldehyde</GlossaryTermRef>—may also be cancer 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046476">cell</GlossaryTermRef> inhibitors.<Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/>  The studies discussed in this summary used
either Mexican laetrile/amygdalin or the patented form.  In most instances,
the generic term “laetrile” will be used in this summary; however, a distinction will be
made between the products when necessary.</Para><Para id="_9"> Laetrile can be administered <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044068">orally</GlossaryTermRef> as
a pill, or it can be given by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044678">injection</GlossaryTermRef> (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046682">intravenous</GlossaryTermRef> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044048">intramuscular</GlossaryTermRef>).  It is commonly given
intravenously for a period of time followed by oral <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045768">maintenance therapy</GlossaryTermRef>.  The
incidence of cyanide poisoning is much higher when laetrile is taken orally
<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/> because <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044046">intestinal</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044123">bacteria</GlossaryTermRef> and some commonly
eaten plants contain <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046081">enzymes</GlossaryTermRef> 
(beta-glucosidases) that activate the release of cyanide after laetrile has
been <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044100">ingested</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="22"/> Relatively little breakdown occurs to yield the cyanide
when laetrile is injected.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="22"/>  Administration schedules
and the length of treatment in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043996">animal models</GlossaryTermRef> and humans vary
widely.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="6318190" MedlineID="84095133">Howard-Ruben J, Miller NJ: Unproven methods of cancer management.

form; however, the formulation was judged too <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043986">toxic</GlossaryTermRef>, and the work was

species <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046631">transplanted</GlossaryTermRef> onto another species), and in humans to determine whether
it has specific anticancer properties (an ability to kill cancer cells more
readily than normal cells).  As noted previously (<SummaryRef href="CDR0000062976#_5" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/laetrile-pdq">General Information</SummaryRef>), cyanide is believed to be the main cancer-killing ingredient in

amygdalin.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_13">Four different theories have been advanced to explain the anticancer
activity of laetrile.  The first of these incorporates elements of the
trophoblastic theory of cancer, a theory that is not widely accepted as an
explanation for cancer formation.  According to the trophoblastic theory, all
cancers arise from primordial <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046382">germ cells</GlossaryTermRef> (cells that, under normal
circumstances, would give rise to eggs or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000257221">sperm</GlossaryTermRef>), some of which become
dispersed throughout the body during 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044250">embryonic</GlossaryTermRef> development and, therefore, are not confined to the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000367406">testes</GlossaryTermRef> or
 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046687">ovaries</GlossaryTermRef>.  The trophoblastic theory also suggests that transformation of
primordial germ cells to a cancerous state is normally prevented by enzymes
from the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046254">pancreas</GlossaryTermRef>, and that cancers can
be destroyed by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044074">pancreatic</GlossaryTermRef> enzyme
 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045916">supplements</GlossaryTermRef> and treatment with laetrile.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/>  The rationale
for laetrile use is the suggestion that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045772">malignant</GlossaryTermRef> cells have higher than
normal levels of an  enzyme called beta-glucuronidase (which is different from
the aforementioned enzyme beta-glucosidase) and that they are deficient in
another enzyme called rhodanese (thiosulfate sulfurtransferase).Another suggestion is that laetrile is modified in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046312">liver</GlossaryTermRef>, and that
beta-glucuronidase breaks down the modified compound, ultimately producing
cyanide.  Rhodanese can convert cyanide into the relatively harmless compound
thiocyanate.  Thus, it has been proposed that cancer cells are more
susceptible to the toxic effects of laetrile than normal cells because of an
imbalance in these two enzymes.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/>  Some experimental evidence does support the idea that normal 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissues</GlossaryTermRef> and malignant tissues differ substantially in their concentrations of
beta-glucuronidase <Reference refidx="21"/> and rhodanese.<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/></Para><Para id="_14">The second theory states that cancer cells contain more beta-glucosidase
activity than normal cells and, as in the first theory, that they are
deficient in rhodanese.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/> Again, elevated beta-glucosidase activity in the interstitial regions of some <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045771">malignancies</GlossaryTermRef> has been experimentally demonstrated.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/></Para><Para id="_15">The third theory states that cancer is the result of a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044055">metabolic disorder</GlossaryTermRef> caused by a
 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044744">vitamin</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000321364">deficiency</GlossaryTermRef>.  It states further that laetrile, or “vitamin B-17,” is
the missing vitamin needed by the body to restore health.<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/>  Experimental evidence indicates that the level of intake of
individual vitamins and/or the vitamin status of an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046250">organism</GlossaryTermRef> can influence the development of
cancer, but there is no evidence that laetrile is needed for normal <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046173">metabolism</GlossaryTermRef> or that it can function as a
vitamin in animals or humans.<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/></Para><Para id="_16">The fourth theory suggests that the cyanide released by laetrile has a
toxic effect beyond its interference with oxygen utilization by cells. 
According to this theory, cyanide increases the acid content of tumors and
leads to the destruction of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044053">lysosomes</GlossaryTermRef> 
(compartments inside cells that contain enzymes capable of breaking down other
cellular <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045065">molecules</GlossaryTermRef>).  The injured
lysosomes release their contents, thereby killing the cancer cells and
arresting tumor growth.<Reference refidx="15"/>  According to this theory, another
consequence of  lysosome disruption is stimulation of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356">immune system</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="356691" MedlineID="78255119">Dorr RT, Paxinos J: The current status of laetrile.

to indirectly sensitize the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044040">hypoxic</GlossaryTermRef> 
(oxygen-starved) cells at the center of a tumor to the lethal effects of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044031">gamma irradiation</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="17"/>  Cells at
the periphery (outer edge) of a tumor are more sensitive to gamma irradiation
because they are not oxygen-deprived.  Radiation kills cells, in part, by
splitting <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045065">molecules</GlossaryTermRef>, including oxygen molecules, to form <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044030">free radicals</GlossaryTermRef>, which are highly
reactive chemicals that can damage <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044393">DNA</GlossaryTermRef> and other important cellular
components.  It has been proposed that, by inhibiting oxygen uptake by
peripheral tumor cells, more oxygen will diffuse to the hypoxic cells, thereby
increasing their sensitivity to radiation.  In this study, beta-glucosidase
was used to break down amygdalin to release cyanide, with the cyanide
inhibiting oxygen uptake by peripheral tumor cells.  Presumably, cyanide
uptake by interior tumor cells is less than that of cells located at a tumor’s
periphery.  Spheres of tumor cells created in the laboratory and tumor slices
were used in the study.  The investigators found that amygdalin and
beta-glucosidase could act as indirect radiation sensitizers of hypoxic tumor
cells.  It should be noted, however, that independent confirmation of this
positive finding has not been published in a peer-reviewed scientific
journal.  A major hurdle in the application of this technique to animals and
humans is the development of a method for delivering a sufficient amount of
cyanide to tumors without causing substantial <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045921">systemic</GlossaryTermRef> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044084">regional</GlossaryTermRef> toxicity.</Para><Para id="_25">The toxicity of laetrile appears to be dependent on the route of

under <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044032">germ-free</GlossaryTermRef> conditions and rats
bred and raised under normal conditions were given oral amygdalin.  The
germ-free rats exhibited no side effects from the compound, and their blood
concentrations of cyanide were indistinguishable from those of untreated rats. 
Many of the rats with normal quantities of intestinal bacteria
showed signs of cyanide poisoning (e.g., lethargy and convulsions), and they
had high levels of cyanide in their blood.  In the second study, rats were
either treated or not treated with the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045967">antibiotic</GlossaryTermRef> neomycin before being given
oral amygdalin.<Reference refidx="6"/>  In this study, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044093">urinary</GlossaryTermRef> excretion of detoxified cyanide
(i.e., thiocyanate) was measured.  The amount of urinary thiocyanate was
40 times higher in rats that had not been given the antibiotic, indicating
that more amygdalin had been broken down in animals with normal amounts of
intestinal bacteria.  In humans, as in rats, substantial breakdown of
amygdalin occurs in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046335">intestines</GlossaryTermRef>;
however, little breakdown of either intravenously or intramuscularly delivered
amygdalin occurs in humans, with most of the intact compound eventually
excreted in urine.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="29"/></Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Gostomski FE: The effects of amygdalin on the Krebs-2 carcinoma and adult and fetal DUB(ICR) mice.

elapsed time before the initiation of benzaldehyde treatment was not
disclosed.</Para><Para id="_30">In 1978, the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044266">National Cancer Institute</GlossaryTermRef> (NCI) requested case reports from practitioners who believed
that their patients had benefitted from laetrile treatment.<Reference refidx="12"/>  Ninety-three cases
were submitted, and 67 were considered evaluable for response.  An expert
panel concluded that two of the 67 patients had complete responses and that
four of the others had partial responses while using laetrile.<Reference refidx="13"/>  On the basis of
these six responses, the NCI agreed to sponsor <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045830">phase I</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045831">phase II clinical trials</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para><Para id="_31">The phase I study was designed to test the doses, routes of administration,
and the schedule of administration judged representative of those used by
laetrile practitioners.<Reference refidx="3"/>  The study involved six cancer patients.  The
investigators found that intravenous and oral amygdalin showed minimal
toxicity under the conditions evaluated; however, two patients who ate raw
almonds while undergoing oral treatment developed symptoms of cyanide
poisoning.</Para><Para id="_32">The phase II study was conducted in 1982 and was designed to test the types
of cancer that might benefit from laetrile treatment.<Reference refidx="2"/>  Most
patients had <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000444971">breast</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044237">colon</GlossaryTermRef>, or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000445043">lung cancer</GlossaryTermRef>.  To be eligible for the trial,
patients had to be in good general condition (not totally disabled or near
death), and they must not have received any other cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044737">therapy</GlossaryTermRef> for at least
1 month before treatment with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454511">amygdalin</GlossaryTermRef>.  Amygdalin, evaluated for potency
and purity by the NCI,<Reference refidx="14"/> was administered intravenously for 21 days,
followed by oral <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045768">maintenance therapy</GlossaryTermRef>, utilizing doses and procedures similar
to those evaluated in the phase I study.  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044744">Vitamins</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046704">pancreatic enzymes</GlossaryTermRef> were
also administered as part of a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044057">metabolic therapy</GlossaryTermRef> program that included dietary
changes to restrict the use of caffeine, sugar, meats, dairy products, eggs,
and alcohol.  A small subset of patients received higher-dose amygdalin
therapy and higher doses of some vitamins as part of the trial. 
Patients were followed up until there was definite evidence of cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044078">progression</GlossaryTermRef>, elevated blood cyanide
levels, or severe clinical deterioration.  Among 175 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044029">evaluable patients</GlossaryTermRef>, only one patient met the criteria for response.  This patient, who had <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046770">gastric</GlossaryTermRef> carcinoma with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044102">cervical</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045762">lymph node</GlossaryTermRef> metastasis,
experienced a partial response that was maintained for 10 weeks while on
amygdalin therapy.  Fifty-four percent of the patients had measurable disease
progression at the end of the intravenous course of treatment, and all
of the patients had disease progression 7 months after completing  intravenous therapy. 
Seven percent of the patients reported an improvement in performance status
(ability to work or to perform routine daily activities) at some time during
therapy, and 20 percent claimed <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044090">symptomatic</GlossaryTermRef> relief.  In most patients,
these benefits did not persist.  Blood cyanide levels were not elevated after
intravenous amygdalin treatment; however, they were elevated after oral
therapy.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_34">Variations in commercial preparations of laetrile from Mexico, the primary
supplier, have been documented.<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/>  Incorrect product labels have been
found, and samples contaminated with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044123">bacteria</GlossaryTermRef> and other substances have been
identified.<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/>  When a comparison was made of products manufactured in the
