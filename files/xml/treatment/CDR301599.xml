Most American adults say that they believe in God and that their  religious beliefs affect how they live their lives. However, people have different ideas about life after death, belief in miracles,  and other religious beliefs. Such beliefs may be based on  gender, education, and ethnic background. </Para><Para id="_58">Many patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef>  rely on spiritual or religious beliefs and practices to help them <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454700">cope</GlossaryTermRef> with their disease.  This is called spiritual coping. Many <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000648947">caregivers</GlossaryTermRef> also  rely on spiritual coping.   Each person may have different spiritual needs, depending on <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000476357">cultural</GlossaryTermRef> and religious traditions. For some seriously ill patients, spiritual well-being may affect how much <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000430405">anxiety</GlossaryTermRef> they feel about death. For others, it may affect what  they decide about end-of-life treatments. Some patients and their family caregivers may want doctors to talk about spiritual concerns, but may feel unsure about how to bring up the subject. </Para><Para id="_59">Some studies show that  doctors' support of spiritual well-being in very ill patients  helps improve their   <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef>.  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000650566">Health care providers</GlossaryTermRef>  who treat patients coping with cancer are looking at new ways to   help them with religious and spiritual concerns. Doctors may  ask patients which  spiritual issues  are important to them during treatment as well as near the end of life. When patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000478743">advanced cancer</GlossaryTermRef> receive spiritual support from the medical team, they may be more likely to choose <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044182">hospice</GlossaryTermRef> care and less <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046053">aggressive</GlossaryTermRef> treatment at the end of life. (See the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044271">PDQ</GlossaryTermRef> summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000757898" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/planning/end-of-life-pdq">Planning the Transition to End-of-Life Care in Advanced Cancer</SummaryRef> for information on end-of-life issues.)</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_2"><KeyPoint id="_3">Spirituality and religion may have different meanings.</KeyPoint><Para id="_68">
The terms spirituality and religion are often used in place of each other, but for many people they have different meanings. Religion may be defined as a specific set of beliefs and practices, usually within an organized group. Spirituality may be defined as an individual's sense of peace, purpose, and connection to others, and beliefs about the meaning of life. Spirituality may be found and expressed through an organized religion or in other ways. Patients may think of themselves as spiritual or religious or both.

The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language.

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_AboutThis_10"><Title>Clinical Trial Information</Title><Para id="_AboutThis_11">A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
