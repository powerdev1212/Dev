Researchers estimate the absolute risk by studying a large number of people that are part of a certain population (for example, women in a given age group). Researchers count the number of people in the group who get a certain disease over a certain period of time. For example,  a group of 100,000 women between the ages of 20 and 29 are observed for one year, and  4 of them get <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000444971">breast cancer</GlossaryTermRef> during that time.

Researchers compare two groups of people who are a lot alike. However, the people in one of the groups must have the trait or factor being studied (they have been “exposed”). The people in the other group do not have it (they have not been exposed). To figure out relative risk, the percentage of people in the exposed group who have the disease is divided by the percentage of people in the unexposed group who have the disease.</Para><Para id="_167">Relative risks can be:</Para><ItemizedList id="_166" Style="bullet"><ListItem>	Larger than 1: The trait or factor is linked to an increase in risk.</ListItem><ListItem>Equal to 1: The trait or factor is not linked to  risk.</ListItem><ListItem>Less than 1: The trait or  factor is linked to a decrease in risk.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_174">Relative risks are also called risk ratios.</Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Odds ratio</Strong> <Para id="_125">In some types of studies, researchers don’t have enough information to figure out relative risks.

An odds ratio can be an estimate of relative risk.</Para><Para id="_168">One type of study that uses an odds ratio instead of relative risk is called a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000348989">case-control study</GlossaryTermRef>. In a case-control study, two groups of people are compared. However, the individuals in each group are chosen based on whether or not they have a certain disease. Researchers look at the odds that the people in each group were exposed to something (a trait or factor) that might have caused the disease. Odds describes the number of times the trait or factor was present or happened, divided by the number of times it wasn’t present or didn’t happen. To get an odds ratio, the odds for one group are divided by the odds for the other group.</Para><Para id="_169">Odds ratios can be:</Para><ItemizedList id="_170" Style="bullet"><ListItem>	Larger than 1: The trait or factor is linked to an increase in risk.</ListItem><ListItem>Equal to 1: The trait or factor is not linked to  risk.</ListItem><ListItem>Less than 1: The trait or factor is linked to a decrease in risk.</ListItem></ItemizedList></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_178">Looking at traits and exposures in people with and without cancer can help find possible <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045873">risk factors</GlossaryTermRef>.

Some screening tests have been shown to be helpful both in finding cancers early and in decreasing the chance of dying from those cancers. Other tests are used because they have been shown to find a certain type of cancer in some people before <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045022">symptoms</GlossaryTermRef> appear, but they have not been proven to decrease the risk of dying from that cancer.

This is often used to measure  how well cancer treatments work. However, to see if screening tests are useful,  studies usually look at whether  deaths from the cancer decrease in people who were screened.

Patients are often diagnosed after they have signs and symptoms of cancer. If a screening test leads to a diagnosis before a patient has any symptoms, the patient’s survival time is increased because the date of diagnosis is earlier. This increase in survival time makes it seem as though screened patients are living longer when that may not be happening. This is called lead-time bias. It could be that the only reason  the survival time appears to be longer is that the date of diagnosis is earlier for the screened patients. But the screened patients may die at the same time they would have without the screening test. </Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Overdiagnosis</Strong> <Para id="_84">Sometimes,  screening tests 
find cancers that don't matter because they would have gone away on their own or never caused  any symptoms. These cancers would never have been found if not for the screening test.

For example, a cohort study might follow a group of women who have regular Pap tests, and divide  them into those who test positive for the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045714">human papillomavirus</GlossaryTermRef> (HPV) and those who test negative for HPV.

These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Date Last Modified") is the date of the most recent change.
</Para><Para id="_AboutThis_9">The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/screening-prevention-board">PDQ Screening and Prevention Editorial Board</ExternalRef>.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_AboutThis_10"><Title>Clinical Trial Information</Title><Para id="_AboutThis_11">A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
</Para><Para id="_AboutThis_12">Clinical trials are listed in PDQ and can be found online at <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials">NCI's Web site</ExternalRef>. Many cancer doctors who take part in clinical trials are also listed in PDQ. For more information, call the Cancer Information Service 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
