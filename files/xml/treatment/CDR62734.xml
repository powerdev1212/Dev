Research indicates that for at least a subset of patients, fatigue may be a significant issue long into survivorship.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/> Fatigue is also seen as a presenting symptom in cancers that produce problems such as anemia, endocrine changes, and respiratory obstruction and is common in people with advanced cancer who are not undergoing active cancer treatment.  Cancer treatment–related fatigue is reported in 14% to 96% of patients undergoing cancer treatment <Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/> and in 19% to 82% of patients posttreatment.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_237"> Several studies have documented significantly worse fatigue in cancer survivors compared with  noncancer populations, as described in one review article.<Reference refidx="1"/>  For example, a Norwegian cross-sectional study <Reference refidx="11"/> compared the prevalence of fatigue in long-term survivors of testicular cancer (n = 1,431) at an average of 11 years posttreatment with the prevalence of fatigue in age-matched men in the general Norwegian population (n = 1,080). The prevalence of chronic cancer-related fatigue (CRF) was 17.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.2–19.1%) among testicular cancer survivors, compared with 9.7% (95% CI, 8.0–11.5%) in the general population. Chronic CRF was also associated with multiple psychosocial problems, somatic complaints, and poor quality of life.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_154">Fatigue, like pain, is viewed as a self-perceived state.

Such correlates have included measures of muscle weakness, maximal oxygen uptake, cytokines, and cortisol.</Para><Para id="_155">Fatigue experienced as a side effect of cancer treatment is differentiated from fatigue experienced by healthy people in their daily lives. <Emphasis>Healthy fatigue</Emphasis> is frequently described as acute fatigue that is eventually relieved by sleep and rest; cancer treatment–related fatigue is categorized as chronic fatigue because it is present over a long period of time, interferes with functioning, and is not completely relieved by sleep and rest.<Reference refidx="13"/>  Also, the level of CRF is often disproportionate to the level of activity or energy exerted.<Reference refidx="13"/>  Although the label <Emphasis>chronic fatigue</Emphasis> is accurate, using this label does not mean that people with cancer who experience fatigue have chronic fatigue syndrome.  Using the phrase <Emphasis>chronic fatigue</Emphasis> can be confusing to both patients and health professionals.  Terms such as <Emphasis>cancer fatigue</Emphasis>, <Emphasis>cancer-related fatigue</Emphasis>, and <Emphasis>cancer treatment–related fatigue</Emphasis> have all been used in the clinical literature, research literature, and educational materials for patients and the public.</Para><Para id="_156">Fatigue has a negative impact on all areas of function, including the following:<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_334" Style="bullet"><ListItem> Mood.</ListItem><ListItem>Physical function.</ListItem><ListItem>Work performance.</ListItem><ListItem>Social interaction.</ListItem><ListItem>Family care.<Reference refidx="18"/></ListItem><ListItem> Cognitive performance.</ListItem><ListItem>School work.</ListItem><ListItem>Community activities.</ListItem><ListItem>Sense of self.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_335">The pattern of fatigue associated with cancer treatment varies according to type and schedule of treatment. For example, people treated with cyclic chemotherapy regimens generally exhibit peak fatigue in the days following treatment, then report lower levels of fatigue until the next treatment; however, those undergoing external-beam radiation therapy report gradually increasing fatigue over the course of therapy of the largest treatment field.  Few studies of people undergoing cancer treatment have addressed the issue of fatigue as a result of the emotional distress associated with undergoing a diagnostic evaluation for cancer and the effects of medical and surgical procedures used for that evaluation and for initial treatment.  Because most adults enter the cancer care system following at least one surgical procedure and because surgery and emotional distress are both associated with fatigue, it is likely that most people beginning nonsurgical treatment are experiencing fatigue at the beginning of treatment.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/></Para><Para id="_160">Recommendations for fatigue management focus on identifying factors that may be contributing to fatigue.  Because the only definitive causal mechanism demonstrated through research to date is chemotherapy-induced anemia, most clinical recommendations for managing fatigue caused by something other than chemotherapy-induced anemia rely on careful development of clinical hypotheses, as outlined in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines on fatigue.<Reference refidx="21"/> The only level 1 intervention for CRF at this time is exercise.

Understanding the causes of fatigue in people with cancer is especially challenging because each individual may experience multiple possible causes of fatigue simultaneously.  This multifactorial etiologic hypothesis is apparent in the various models that have been proposed for the study of fatigue.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> 
 Energy balance, stress, life demands, sleep, neurophysiologic changes, disruption of circadian rhythms, cardiac issues, and neuroimmunologic changes are generally incorporated in these models, based on the rationale that these factors are associated with fatigue in contexts other than cancer.<Reference refidx="3"/> The cancer literature supports some of these variables.</Para><Para id="_254">There is a burgeoning amount of evidence, particularly in women with breast cancer and men with prostate cancer, that fatigue is associated with markers of increased immune inflammatory activity.  When fatigued individuals with a history of breast cancer are compared with breast cancer survivors without fatigue, different patterns emerge with respect to interleukin-6, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, C-reactive protein, neopterin, and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-II.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>  Although the precise relationships—and the clinical meaning of those relationships—are not yet known, increased cytokines likely contribute to the symptoms of asthenia, fatigue, and lethargy, as supported in animal models of cytokine-induced sickness behavior <Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> and in humans.<Reference refidx="9"/>  There have not yet been large, well-controlled studies that have evaluated the effects of general anti-inflammatory agents on fatigue or cytokine biomarkers.</Para><Para id="_255">     Other studies demonstrate a change in the regulation of cortisol by the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis.  One key study put fatigued and nonfatigued breast cancer survivors through a stress battery in a laboratory setting.   Nonfatigued survivors mounted a significant cortisol increase in response to acute stress, while fatigued survivors had a very blunted response.<Reference refidx="10"/>  Another study has shown fatigued breast cancer survivors have flattened cortisol slopes, having higher levels of cortisol at the end of the day than do  nonfatigued survivors.<Reference refidx="11"/>  It is the dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that may account for the prolonged inflammatory cytokine milieu; understanding the body’s response to numerous chronic stressors in cancer may help in managing fatigue.</Para><Para id="_257">Finally, another theory is that serotonin is negatively impacted through chronic exposure to proinflammatory cytokines.  One hypothesis is that the relationship between central nervous system concentrations of serotonin and fatigue have a U-shaped relationship, suggesting that very high and very low levels of serotonin may be associated with cancer-related fatigue.<Reference refidx="12"/> However, studies that have evaluated serotonergic agents have not demonstrated a benefit for fatigue.<Reference refidx="2"/> The role and relationship of many important neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin with HPA axis functioning and cytokine expression have yet to be fully understood.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Miaskowski C, Portenoy RK: Update on the assessment and management of cancer-related fatigue.

person’s physical, psychosocial, and financial well-being, are sources of
emotional stress.  Distress associated with the diagnosis of cancer alone may
trigger fatigue.  A study of 74 early-stage breast cancer patients with no
history of affective disorder assessed various symptoms of adjustment
approximately 2 weeks after diagnosis; about 45% noted moderate or high levels
of fatigue.  This fatigue may have been secondary to the increased cognitive
strain of dealing with the diagnosis or to insomnia, reported as moderate to severe by about 60% of the patients.  Therefore, fatigue may begin before
treatment as a result of worry or other cognitive factors, both primary and secondary
to insomnia.  Various forms of treatment may compound this fatigue.<Reference refidx="42"/></Para><Para id="_342"> In cancer survivors, fatigue may also be increased above levels seen in the general population.<Reference refidx="43"/><Reference refidx="44"/>  In testicular cancer survivors, anxiety and depression were predictive of fatigue, suggesting a possible role for psychiatric intervention in fatigue management.<Reference refidx="45"/>  (Refer to the PDQ summaries on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062739" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/depression-hp-pdq">Depression</SummaryRef> and <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062891" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/anxiety-distress-hp-pdq">Adjustment to Cancer: Anxiety and Distress</SummaryRef> for

In the regression model, age, distress and expectancy each uniquely contributed to fatigue, with distress and expectancy  accounting for 25% of the variance.<Reference refidx="46"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663087">Level of evidence: III</LOERef>]  In a longitudinal study with women who had gynecologic cancer, symptom and psychologic distress significantly predicted fatigue before, during, and after treatment with chemotherapy, explaining up to 80% of the variance in fatigue scores after chemotherapy treatment.<Reference refidx="47"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_29"><Title>Cognitive Factors</Title><Para id="_30">Impairment in cognitive functioning, including decreased attention span and
impaired perception and thinking, is commonly associated with fatigue.<Reference refidx="48"/><Reference refidx="49"/> 
Although fatigue and cognitive impairments are linked, the mechanism underlying
this association is unclear.  Mental demands inherent in the diagnosis and
treatment of cancer have been well documented, but little is known about the
concomitant problem of attention fatigue in people with cancer.  Attention
problems are common during and after cancer treatment.  Some of the reported
attention problems may be caused by the fatigue of directed attention.<Reference refidx="50"/><Reference refidx="51"/>
Attention fatigue may be relieved by activities that promote rest and recovery
of directed attention.  Although sleep is necessary for relieving attention
fatigue and restoring attention, it is insufficient when attention demands are
high.  Empirical literature suggests that the natural environment contains the
properties for restoring directed attention and relieving attention fatigue.

In addition, concurrent medications such as analgesics, hypnotics, antidepressants, antiemetics, steroids, or anticonvulsants—many of which act on the central nervous system—can significantly compound the problem of fatigue. The coadministration of multiple drugs with varying
side effects may compound fatigue symptoms.

the size of the red blood cell as measured by the mean corpuscular volume
(MCV).  Microcytic anemias are associated with an MCV of 79
fL or lower and include iron-deficiency anemia, thalassemia, and anemia of
chronic disease.  Macrocytic anemias are associated with an MCV higher than 101 fL and include anemias related to vitamin B<Subscript>12</Subscript> or folate
deficiency, myelodysplasia, and liver disease.  Most anemias are normocytic,
meaning that the MCV is in the normal range.  This category includes
the following:<Reference refidx="25"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_300" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Myelophthisic anemia (i.e., anemia due to neoplastic replacement of the bone marrow).</ListItem><ListItem>Most chemotherapy-related anemias.</ListItem><ListItem>Anemia due to renal or hepatic dysfunction.</ListItem><ListItem>Hemolytic anemia.</ListItem><ListItem>Aplastic anemia.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_301">However, a mixed red blood cell population
consisting of both microcytic and macrocytic cells (anisocytosis) may
indicate a combined etiology, for example, chronic blood loss (microcytic) with
resultant reticulocytosis (macrocytic).  In this situation, the MCV may be in
the normal range, but the red blood cell size distribution width would be
elevated.</Para><Para id="_81">The peripheral blood smear examination, though often overlooked, remains an
important step in the evaluation of anemia.  For example, nucleated blood cells
and teardrop-shaped red blood cells suggest myelophthisic anemia. 
Macro-ovalocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils often indicate megaloblastic
anemia.  Small target cells and basophilic stippling are associated with
thalassemia.</Para><Para id="_82">Additional studies that are sometimes required to characterize anemia in a
given patient include testing of vitamin B<Subscript>12</Subscript> or folate levels; serum iron,
transferrin, and ferritin levels; erythropoietin level, the direct and indirect
Coombs test, and/or examination of a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy.  In
cancer patients, the underlying etiology is often multifactorial.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Portenoy RK, Miaskowski C: Assessment and management of cancer-related fatigue.

a determination of the causative mechanisms of fatigue in oncology patients,
interventions must be directed to symptom management and emotional support. 
Although some recommendations for the management of fatigue in oncology
patients have been made, these are theoretical or anecdotal in nature and in
general have not been the focus of scientific evaluation.
</Para><Para id="_355">Published in 2013, a  study conducted in patients with advanced cancer (N = 152) demonstrated that managing symptoms (e.g., pain, nausea, and decreased appetite) can have a significant positive impact on fatigue.  In this 12-week study, patients were randomly assigned to receive either monitoring and protocolized treatment of physical symptoms coordinated by a nurse or care as usual (symptom management included in the standard oncologic care). Patients in the intervention group received tailored treatment for any of the identified troublesome symptoms. Fatigue levels, as measured by the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, showed significant improvement in the intervention group compared with the group receiving care as usual. The intervention group also showed improvements in the following:<Reference refidx="5"/> </Para><ItemizedList id="_364" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Specific fatigue dimensions.</ListItem><ListItem>Interference by fatigue with daily life.</ListItem><ListItem>Overall symptom burden.</ListItem><ListItem>Symptoms of depression and anxiety.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_365">Similar studies are needed to investigate whether treatment of specific physical and psychological symptoms can alleviate fatigue and to identify patient populations that might benefit from such management. One message of this study may be that fatigue can be a primary symptom or a secondary symptom (a result of other bothersome problems).  Therefore,  assessing patients for the appropriate target symptom for intervention is probably the most efficient way to help patients improve health-related quality of life.</Para><Para id="_85">Because the etiology and mechanisms regarding fatigue/asthenia in cancer patients
are indeterminate, there is considerable variation in practice patterns
regarding the management of this symptom.  The focus of medical management is
often directed at identifying specific and potentially reversible correlated
symptoms, as in the following examples:</Para><ItemizedList id="_302" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem> Patients with fatigue and pain may have titration of
pain medications.</ListItem><ListItem>Patients with fatigue and anemia may receive a transfusion of
packed red blood cells, nutritional interventions including iron-rich foods,

treated with antidepressants or psychostimulants.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_303">It is often helpful to
consider discontinuation of drugs that may be safely withheld.  There is no
agreed-upon approach for the evaluation and treatment of fatigue, but an increasing number of clinical trials are designed to address this issue
in cancer patients.</Para><SummarySection id="_380"><Title>Treatment of Anemia</Title><Para id="_381">Anemia in patients with cancer is best managed by treatment of the underlying cause. When the cause is obscure or there is no specific remedy, then treatment is supportive. Nutritional interventions, including the intake of nutrient-rich foods and supplements, are considered in addition to other treatment modalities. Transfusion of packed red blood cells is the most widely used and most rapid way to alleviate symptoms in cancer patients with symptomatic anemia. The likelihood of success in raising the level of hemoglobin is very high with transfusion, and the risks of complications are low. Nevertheless, repeated transfusions can be cumbersome, and the risks of blood-borne infection can be worrisome for patients. Other risks include an acute transfusion reaction, transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease, subtle immune modulation that occurs with transfusion, and iron overload in patients who receive repeated transfusions.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_382">Several large, community-based studies have examined the effectiveness of epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa <Reference refidx="7"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>];<Reference refidx="8"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] in the treatment of cancer-related anemia in patients receiving chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="2"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>];<Reference refidx="9"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663087">Level of evidence: III</LOERef>];<Reference refidx="10"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] A few of the  studies of epoetin alfa employed an open-label, nonrandomized design
and included objective endpoints (hemoglobin response, transfusion
requirements) and subjective evaluation of fatigue and quality of life.  In
this setting, epoetin alfa has been effective at increasing hemoglobin levels
and decreasing transfusion requirements.  In addition, epoetin alfa has been
associated with improved functional status and quality of life,
independent of tumor response.  Several studies of epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa employed a randomized, controlled design. These studies varied in terms of medication dosage and frequency of administration. A review and meta-analysis of randomized and open-label studies concluded that these agents are effective in the management of CRF <Reference refidx="11"/> but also raised serious concerns about safety data and adverse outcomes associated with these agents. The authors concluded that the risks associated with  these agents outweigh their benefits for the treatment of CRF and therefore are not to be used.</Para><Para id="_383">The FDA has conducted a comprehensive review of safety information from studies of these agents.<Reference refidx="12"/> The review showed that in patients with breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, lymphoid, and cervical cancers, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) shortened overall survival and/or increased the risk of tumor progression or recurrence. The review also showed that ESAs increase the risk of serious cardiovascular and thromboembolic events when they are administered to target higher hemoglobin levels (13.5–14 g/dL).</Para><Para id="_384">On the basis of these findings, the FDA mandated revised ESA labeling to include an updated warning, a new boxed warning, and modifications to the indications and dosing instructions. The boxed warning includes information on the higher mortality risks caused by cardiovascular/thromboembolic events and tumor progression or recurrence. The 2010 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines recommend the following:<Reference refidx="13"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_386" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>In accordance with the FDA-approved label,<Reference refidx="14"/> the use of these agents should be restricted to the treatment of anemia (hemoglobin level &lt;10 g/dL) caused by concomitant palliative myelosuppressive chemotherapy and should be discontinued upon completion of a course of chemotherapy.

Clinicians  initiate discussions with patients and family members about the  risks and benefits of ESAs.</Para><Para id="_388">In February 2010, the FDA approved and mandated a risk management program to inform health care providers and their patients about the risk of ESAs.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="17"/> This program includes a specific medication guide for patients that, along with the FDA public health advisory,<Reference refidx="18"/> states that ESAs are not approved or indicated for the treatment of fatigue in patients with cancer.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_86"><Title>Psychostimulants</Title><Para id="_261">One of the most popular categories of  pharmacologic interventions evaluated for cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is psychostimulants (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062734#_289" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/fatigue/fatigue-hp-pdq">Table 2</SummaryRef>). Psychostimulants are drugs that interact with neurotransmitters and receptors in the brain to increase cortical function.  Different types of psychostimulants work through various mechanisms to produce activity in the brain consistent with short-term improvement in energy level and psychomotor activity.  These medications may  also improve mood, attention, and concentration in some populations. Psychostimulants  on the market include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_313" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Methylphenidate.</ListItem><ListItem>Dextroamphetamine.</ListItem><ListItem>Pemoline.</ListItem><ListItem>Modafinil.</ListItem><ListItem>Armodafinil.</ListItem><ListItem>Nonprescription caffeine.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_262">Initial support for the hypothesis that psychostimulants may improve CRF arises largely from clinical anecdotal experiences. These medications are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of CRF. However, preliminary evidence from  randomized controlled studies <Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/>

suggests that these medications might be helpful in a subpopulation of patients experiencing more severe fatigue. There are at least seven published randomized clinical trials evaluating psychostimulants for CRF: six with methylphenidate and one with modafinil.  Only one of these randomized trials <Reference refidx="19"/> has shown significant differences between the placebo group and methylphenidate group with respect to the outcome of fatigue.</Para><Para id="_310">The one  study that  demonstrated significant improvements over placebo for CRF used a mean dose of 27.7 mg of the D-isomer of methylphenidate as a study intervention.<Reference refidx="19"/>  The population that benefited was women who had completed chemotherapy for breast or ovarian cancer.  The study design incorporated a titration to effect, so some patients who may have benefited may have received more than 27.7 mg of the drug.  Furthermore, 11% of participants on this trial withdrew because of adverse events, compared with 1% in the placebo arm.  Conversely, an equally large randomized controlled trial randomly assigned patients with early and advanced disease, both on and off treatment, to receive 54 mg of a long-acting methylphenidate preparation equaling 27 mg of the D-isomer or a placebo; this trial found no differences between the two groups in any of the fatigue outcomes.<Reference refidx="22"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] There were significant differences between groups for nervousness and appetite loss, with the methylphenidate arm scoring worse on both of those side effects.</Para><Para id="_264">The newer so-called wake-promoting agents, modafinil and armodafinil, are just beginning to be studied for CRF.  Modafinil is a centrally acting, nonamphetamine, central nervous system stimulant.<Reference refidx="23"/> Armodafinil is the R-enantiomer of modafinil and an alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist.<Reference refidx="24"/> Modafinil and armodafinil are approved by the FDA  for narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, and shift-work disorders. Neither of  these agents is approved by the FDA for the treatment of CRF. These agents are also not indicated for use in children and adolescents.  The mechanism of action  of modafinil and armodafinil is different from that of amphetamines, but the exact mechanisms by which these agents improve wakefulness are not known.   On the basis of a couple of promising open-label pilot trials,<Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/> a large randomized controlled trial evaluated modafinil for CRF using 200 mg versus placebo in more than 850 patients receiving chemotherapy.  Patients had to have fatigue ratings of at least 2 out of 10 to be eligible for this study.  During four cycles of chemotherapy, this study failed to show significant differences between arms.<Reference refidx="21"/> Because armodafinil is newer to the marketplace, research on its possible role in CRF has not yet been published.  More research is needed to identify whether modafinil and armodafinil can ameliorate fatigue and which populations of cancer survivors can benefit most from them.</Para><Para id="_265">With both methylphenidate and modafinil, there have been exploratory data suggesting that patients with more severe fatigue or more advanced disease may receive more benefit from these drugs.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/> A  small (n = 13), randomized, placebo-controlled study <Reference refidx="20"/> using  methylphenidate (titrated up to 30 mg/day) as an intervention failed to show statistical difference on the primary outcome measure, the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) total score, or activity interference subscale. However, the methylphenidate group  showed significant reductions in the BFI severity subscale scores compared with the reductions seen in the placebo group.  The mean severity score at baseline was 6.5 for the methylphenidate group and 5.7 for the placebo group, placing these patients in a more severe fatigue category.  A secondary analysis of the phase III trial that evaluated modafinil versus placebo for CRF also revealed that patients with more severe fatigue may have benefited from modafinil.<Reference refidx="21"/>  More research is needed to further evaluate whether psychostimulants are beneficial for patients experiencing more severe CRF.</Para><Para id="_267">The side effects most commonly described with psychostimulants include the following:<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_348" Style="bullet"><ListItem> Insomnia.</ListItem><ListItem>Euphoria.</ListItem><ListItem>Headache.</ListItem><ListItem>Nausea.</ListItem><ListItem>Anxiety.</ListItem><ListItem> Mood lability.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_349"> High doses and long-term use may produce:</Para><ItemizedList id="_350" Style="bullet">

It is important to note that none of these subjects were being treated with known cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic regimens such as anthracyclines.<Reference refidx="20"/> Careful and continuous monitoring of certain cardiovascular parameters (mainly blood pressure and heart rate) is critical when psychostimulants are used to treat CRF. In certain complex cases, consulting with cardiology services may be considered. Cardiovascular issues are thought to be less of a risk with modafinil and armodafinil.  Risk-benefit ratio may be considered and patients may be evaluated for response and side effects when these agents are used to treat CRF.</Para><Para id="_268">The package inserts for all Schedule IV stimulant medications carry boxed warnings indicating risk of abuse potential and/or risk of psychological dependence.

When the use of these medications is being considered, it is important to obtain informed consent, with careful discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives. Continuous monitoring of cardiovascular parameters is crucial when these medications are used, especially in patients with preexisting cardiovascular issues and in patients being treated with known cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic regimens (e.g., anthracyclines). In certain cases, consulting with cardiology services might be necessary.

Eighty-four patients were randomly assigned to receive either dexamethasone 4 mg twice per day or a placebo for 14 days.  The primary endpoint was improvement in fatigue from baseline to day 15, as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) scale.  Investigators also evaluated depression, anxiety, and symptom distress.  In the group who received dexamethasone, mean scores on the FACIT-F scale were significantly improved by day 8 (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .005) and at day 15 (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .008).  Physical well-being and physical distress were also significantly better in the group who received dexamethasone.  Emotional scores and overall symptom distress were not significantly different.  Adverse events, as measured by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, did not differ between groups.</Para><Para id="_370">One limitation of this study was that it was only 2 weeks long, and longer-term use of dexamethasone is well known to be associated with unwanted side effects.  Therefore, the risk versus benefit of treating  fatigue with dexamethasone for more than 2 weeks requires investigation.   Because fatigue has been associated with high levels of inflammation, this study is noteworthy in its evaluation of dexamethasone as an anti-inflammatory  agent to alleviate fatigue.<Reference refidx="31"/> The investigators did not assess inflammatory biomarkers; therefore, the proof of concept that modifying inflammation can reduce fatigue needs replication.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_371"><Title>Dietary supplements</Title><Para id="_372">Dietary supplements comprise other, often popular, pharmacologic interventions for CRF.</Para><SummarySection id="_373"><Title>L-carnitine</Title><Para id="_374">L-carnitine is a widely used dietary supplement believed to be helpful for the treatment of CRF because of its role in cellular energy metabolism and carnitine’s ability to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines.  Promising pilot data led to the development and completion of a large (N = 376) phase III study in a multisite cooperative group setting.  Participants with moderate to severe fatigue were randomly assigned to receive either 10 g levocarnitine or a placebo for 4 weeks.  The primary endpoint was change in average fatigue.

Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 2,000 mg of American ginseng (specifically, Wisconsin ginseng) in the form of ground root in a capsule or a matching placebo.  The primary endpoint was change in fatigue scores as measured by the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form.  At 4 weeks, the group receiving ginseng showed a trend toward significant improvement, while at 8 weeks, there was a significant and clinically meaningful difference favoring the ginseng group.

cancer. The benefits shown in these studies and observed in clinical settings
include improved physical energy, appetite stimulation, and/or enhanced

Increased physical activity after cancer was related to less fatigue and pain and better physical functioning.  Significant positive associations were found with moderate to vigorous recreational physical activity but not household activity.  This study suggests that breast cancer survivors may be able to decrease fatigue and bodily pain and be better able to pursue daily activities by increasing their recreational physical activities after cancer.<Reference refidx="53"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_96">Exercise for patients with advanced or terminal disease is difficult to study

These modalities are unique in that they incorporate cognitive and spiritual elements with movement, stretching, and balance.  One fairly large study evaluated medical qigong for CRF in a heterogeneous group of 162 patients either undergoing cancer treatment or having finished cancer treatment.<Reference refidx="56"/>  This study reported significant improvements in fatigue and several other aspects of quality of life for the intervention group versus usual care.</Para><Para id="_305">The qigong intervention was delivered in 90-minute group sessions twice a week for 10 weeks, for 1,800 minutes of treatment.  The usual-care group did not receive any group meetings or additional provider interaction.  It is therefore difficult to say what qigong uniquely provided over and above nonspecific or group-interaction effects.  It is also not known how much survivors would need to continue performing qigong to maintain benefits.  There were no adverse events in this study, so other than time and resource expenditure, it is difficult to pinpoint a downside to encouraging patients to adopt such an activity.  One important strength of the study evaluating qigong was the collection of serum to measure markers of inflammation.  At the end of 10 weeks, the C-reactive protein of patients in the medical qigong group decreased 3.6 mg/L, while patients in the usual-care group experienced an increase in this marker of 19.57 mg/L.  This was a statistically significant difference.<Reference refidx="56"/></Para><Para id="_362">A second, smaller study (N = 96) that compared a qigong group to a wait-list control group evaluated fatigue using the BFI as a secondary outcome and also assessed a biologic measure, salivary cortisol.

activity/rest program based on an assessment of the patient’s fatigue patterns
that allows the best use of the individual’s energy.  Any changes in daily
routine require additional energy expenditure.  Individuals with cancer are advised about setting priorities and maintaining a reasonable schedule. 
Health professionals may assist patients by providing information on support
services that are available to help with daily activities and responsibilities. 
An occupational therapy consultation can be of assistance in evaluating energy
conservation methods.  Sleep hygiene, including avoidance of lying in bed at
times other than sleep, shortening naps to no more than 1 hour, avoiding
distracting noise (e.g., television, radio) during sleep hours, and other measures may
improve sleep and activity cycles.

with cancer who  have been off all antineoplastic therapy for at least
6 months.  The rationale for creating a separate section is twofold.  First,
the etiology of problems is different for individuals undergoing treatment
versus those who are no longer undergoing therapy.  Second, intervention
strategies and information can be better tailored so that there will be a
greater likelihood of meeting the needs of these two distinct populations.</Para><Para id="_106">Fatigue is a separate and distinct problem for individuals after treatment is
completed.  Many theories have been proposed to explain the etiology of fatigue
in the patient undergoing treatment and to explain the impact of that treatment
on quality of life.  Many of these theories, however, do not apply to the posttreatment population.  Nonetheless, fatigue continues to be a major issue for
individuals who are no longer undergoing therapy and who are considered to be
disease free.</Para><Para id="_107">There is evidence that fatigue significantly affects the quality of life of
cancer survivors.  The experience of fatigue in cancer survivors is quite
similar to the experience of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome in the
general medical setting.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Few studies have been done that indicate the
impact of fatigue on quality of life, but some examples follow:</Para><ItemizedList id="_108" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>In cancer survivors who had bone marrow transplants, 50% of 29 survivors
reported moderate-to-severe fatigue more than 1 year after transplant.
Fatigue was one of the three most negative items studied and had an impact
on quality of life more than any other physical problem.<Reference refidx="2"/></ListItem>
<ListItem>In patients who had bone marrow transplants, 56% of 125 patients reported
ongoing fatigue 6 to 18 years after transplant.<Reference refidx="3"/>
</ListItem>
<ListItem>Of 687 posttreatment survivors of various forms of cancer evaluated for
quality-of-life issues, fatigue was one of the three most negative items
affecting quality of life.<Reference refidx="4"/></ListItem>
<ListItem>Of 90 patients with a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin
lymphoma, 30 reported a lack of energy at a median of 32 months after
diagnosis.<Reference refidx="5"/></ListItem>
<ListItem>Of 403 individuals with Hodgkin lymphoma, 37% reported their energy levels
had not returned to levels that satisfied them even after a median of 9
years posttreatment.<Reference refidx="6"/></ListItem>
<ListItem>In Hodgkin lymphoma survivors, 26% had persistent fatigue 6 months after
treatment with 50% associated with psychological distress.  Increasing age and
no prior psychological symptoms predicted fatigue “caseness.”<Reference refidx="7"/></ListItem>
<ListItem>Of 162 women treated with radiation for breast cancer and 173 women treated
with chemotherapy for breast cancer, 75% and 61%, respectively,
described decreased stamina 2 to 10 years after the completion of
treatment.<Reference refidx="8"/>  In a separate cross-sectional survey of women who completed therapy for breast cancer by a mean of 29 months prior to the survey, 38% had severe fatigue compared with only 11% of matched controls.<Reference refidx="9"/></ListItem>
<ListItem>Fatigue has been reported in women survivors of autologous bone marrow      
transplantation and high-dose chemotherapy treatment for lymphomas 4 
to 10 years posttreatment.<Reference refidx="10"/></ListItem>
<ListItem>Almost one-third of breast cancer survivors at 10 years posttreatment reported significant fatigue.<Reference refidx="11"/></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_109">Although many studies document the incidence of fatigue in those who are no
longer undergoing cancer treatment, the specific mechanism of fatigue remains
unknown.  Because fatigue is a multifaceted problem, determining its etiology
is difficult.</Para><Para id="_110">The information available regarding fatigue in survivors of childhood cancer is
from the literature describing the physiologic and cognitive effects following
treatment.  In one study, cognitive outcomes were evaluated in children 3 to 4
years after diagnosis of brain tumors.  Fatigue was a factor in poor school
performance.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_111">In another study, survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were evaluated
for cognitive deficits after treatment were noted to have a typical fatigue
effect.  This was thought to be a factor in the variability of their test
scores.<Reference refidx="13"/>  Anecdotally, individuals who have received chest and total-body
irradiation complain of fatigue, with an increased sleep requirement.</Para><Para id="_112">People who are successfully treated for cancer are at risk for a variety of
organ-specific complications that are secondary to their treatment.<Reference refidx="14"/>  Fatigue in
the posttreatment population underscores the importance of follow-up care. 
The persistence of fatigue following cancer treatment requires a thorough
evaluation to rule out contributing physiologic conditions.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="11147137" MedlineID="21023870">Servaes P, van der Werf S, Prins J, et al.: Fatigue in disease-free cancer patients compared with fatigue in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.
