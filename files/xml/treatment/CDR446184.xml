It is a liquid that was promoted as a treatment for <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef> and other diseases. Cancell was made using different mixtures of ingredients, mainly by two companies,  since the late 1930s.     
</Para><Para id="_44">None of the common <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000643008">chemicals</GlossaryTermRef> in these products is known to be effective in treating any type of cancer.</Para><Para id="_35">Since 1989, it has been illegal in the United States to make, sell, or give Cancell as a treatment for any disease. Mixtures similar to Cancell, such as Cantron and Protocel, are available as  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000373932">dietary supplements</GlossaryTermRef>.

Sheridan, a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462667">biochemist</GlossaryTermRef> who called the mixture Entelev and gave it free to cancer patients.  In 1984, another company began making Entelev under the name Cancell. That company gave it free to patients with cancer, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045950">AIDS</GlossaryTermRef> (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), and other <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000651193">conditions</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_25"><Question>What is the theory behind the claim that  Cancell is useful in treating cancer?</Question><Answer><Para id="_28">The exact ingredients used to make Cancell are not known.  One sample of the liquid mixture Cancell was found to contain 12 different ingredients, none of which is known to be helpful in treating any type of cancer. The <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454785">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</GlossaryTermRef> (FDA) has listed the  following ingredients in Cancell: </Para><ItemizedList id="_30" Style="bullet"><ListItem><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044134">Inositol</GlossaryTermRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044136">Nitric acid</GlossaryTermRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044101">Sodium sulfite</GlossaryTermRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044141">Potassium hydroxide</GlossaryTermRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044143">Sulfuric acid</GlossaryTermRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044098">Catechol</GlossaryTermRef>.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_34">The first maker of Cancell said the ingredients work together by changing cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046476">cells</GlossaryTermRef> so they are seen by the body as "<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000698772">foreign</GlossaryTermRef>" and are destroyed. The second maker stated that Cancell changes cancer cells so they “self-digest” and are replaced by normal cells. The waste matter made by this self-<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463707">digestion</GlossaryTermRef> was said to be passed from the body in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046642">urine</GlossaryTermRef>, sweat, and other body <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044669">fluids</GlossaryTermRef>.

</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_20"><Question>How is Cancell administered?</Question><Answer><Para id="_8">Cancell has been taken by mouth, inserted into the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046555">rectum</GlossaryTermRef>, or applied to the skin of the wrist or the ball of the foot.  Patients taking Cancell were advised by the makers to take <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044125">bromelain</GlossaryTermRef> to help digestion and to avoid high <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044664">doses</GlossaryTermRef> of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000439435">vitamin C</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045023">vitamin E</GlossaryTermRef>.  Makers of Cancell stated that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044744">vitamins</GlossaryTermRef> raise the energy of the cell while Cancell lowers it.  </Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_21"><Question>Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using Cancell?</Question><Answer><Para id="_33">Research in a laboratory or using animals is done to find out if a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000348921">drug</GlossaryTermRef>, procedure, or treatment    is likely to be useful in humans. These <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044517">preclinical studies</GlossaryTermRef> are done before any testing in humans is begun. Some research studies are published in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044724">scientific</GlossaryTermRef> journals. Most scientific journals have experts who review research reports before they are published, to make sure that the evidence and conclusions are sound. This is called peer review. Studies published in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000537399">peer-reviewed scientific journals</GlossaryTermRef> are considered to be better evidence.</Para><Para id="_9">The <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044266">National Cancer Institute</GlossaryTermRef> (NCI) did <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454774">animal studies</GlossaryTermRef> on Cancell in 1978 and 1980 and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044512">laboratory studies</GlossaryTermRef> in 1990 and 1991. Laboratory studies using human <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumor</GlossaryTermRef> cells concluded that Cancell could not be taken in  doses high enough to  kill cancer cells in the body.

The NCI decided that Cancell did not show enough anticancer activity to continue the studies. See the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044271">PDQ</GlossaryTermRef> health professional summary on  <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062973#_1006" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/hp/cancell-pdq">Cancell/Cantron/Protocel</SummaryRef> for details  on the results of these studies.</Para></Answer><Answer><Para id="_10">The makers of Cancell reported doing animal studies with the liquid mixtures, but  none of these studies have been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  No information has been given on these studies, beyond stating that some of the studies tested the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000445093">toxicity</GlossaryTermRef> (harmful and unwanted <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046580">side effects</GlossaryTermRef>) of Cancell. </Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_22"><Question>Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) been conducted using
Cancell?
</Question><Answer><Para id="_11">No <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045961">clinical trials</GlossaryTermRef> of Cancell have been reported.  The makers of Cancell have stated that more than 
15,000 patients have used the mixture and that it is safe and effective in treating 50% to
80% of all cancers.  Their findings have not been published in
peer-reviewed scientific journals.  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044096">Testimonials</GlossaryTermRef> (information given by people who state that they have been helped by a particular treatment or product) and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043995">anecdotal reports</GlossaryTermRef> (incomplete descriptions of the medical and treatment histories of one or more patients) have been made available by the manufacturers.
</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_23"><Question>Have any side effects or risks been reported from Cancell?</Question><Answer><Para id="_12">The company that made Cancell stated that the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046580">side effects</GlossaryTermRef> of the mixture include feeling tired during the first few weeks of treatment.  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000390302">Nausea</GlossaryTermRef> is also a reported side effect.  One patient who took more than the maker's advised dose reported <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000306496">diarrhea</GlossaryTermRef> that lasted for a few hours.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_24"><Question>Is Cancell approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States?</Question><Answer><Para id="_13">Cancell is not approved for use in the United States.
 In 1989, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration judged Cancell to be a new, unapproved drug.  The FDA requested and received a court order making it illegal for manufacturers to send Cancell across state lines. The  mixture may no longer be made, sold, or given to patients as a treatment for cancer or other diseases.   </Para></Answer></QandAEntry></QandASet></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_14"><SectMetaData><SectionType>Changes to summary</SectionType></SectMetaData><Title>Changes To This Summary (01/07/2015)</Title><Para id="_15">The <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044271">PDQ</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef> information summaries are reviewed regularly and updated as

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_2"><Title>General CAM Information</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_3">Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also referred to as integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_4">Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_5">Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. </Para></SummarySection> 
  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_6"><Title>Evaluation of CAM Approaches</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_7">It is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute  and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_8">Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH)  in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.</Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_9"><ExternalRef xref="http://cam.cancer.gov/cam/best_case_intro.html">The NCI Best Case Series Program</ExternalRef>   which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.</Para></SummarySection>
