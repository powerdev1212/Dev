are often associated with situational stress, illness, aging, and drug
treatment.<Reference refidx="2"/>   It is estimated that one-third to one-half of people with cancer experience sleep
disturbance.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/>  Physical illness, pain, hospitalization, drugs and other
treatments for cancer, and the psychological impact of a malignant disease may
disrupt the sleeping patterns of persons with cancer.<Reference refidx="5"/> Poor sleep adversely
affects daytime mood and performance.  In the general population, persistent
insomnia has been associated with a higher risk of developing clinical anxiety
or depression.<Reference refidx="6"/> Sleep disturbances and, ultimately, sleep-wake cycle reversals
can be early signs of a developing delirium.  (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062772" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/memory/delirium-hp-pdq">Delirium</SummaryRef> for more information.)  Adequate sleep may increase the cancer
patient's pain tolerance.
</Para><Para id="_3">Sleep consists of two phases: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM)
sleep.<Reference refidx="7"/>  REM sleep, also known as dream sleep, is the active or paradoxic
phase of sleep in which the brain is active.  NREM sleep is the quiet or restful
phase of sleep.  NREM, also referred to as slow wave sleep, is divided into four 
stages of progressively deepening sleep based on electroencephalogram
findings.
</Para><Para id="_4">The stages of sleep occur in a repeated pattern or cycle of NREM followed by
REM, with each cycle lasting approximately 90 minutes.  The sleep cycle is
repeated four to six times during a 7- to 8-hour sleep period.<Reference refidx="7"/>  The sleep-wake
cycle is dictated by an inherent biological clock or circadian rhythm. 
Disruptions in individual sleep patterns can disrupt the circadian rhythm and
impair the sleep cycle.<Reference refidx="8"/>

REM rebound has been defined as a marked increase in REM sleep with increased frequency and intensity of dreaming, including nightmares.<Reference refidx="10"/> The increased physiologic arousal that occurs during REM rebound may be dangerous for patients with peptic ulcers or a history of cardiovascular problems. Newer medications for insomnia have reduced adverse effects.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_21">The sleep of hospitalized patients is likely to be frequently interrupted by treatment schedules, hospital routines, and roommates, which singularly
or collectively alter the sleep-wake cycle.  Other factors influencing
sleep-wake cycles in the hospital setting include patient age, comfort, pain, and anxiety; and environmental noise and temperature.<Reference refidx="12"/>
</Para><Para id="_22">Consequences of sleep disturbances can influence outcomes of therapeutic and
supportive care measures.<Reference refidx="13"/>  The patient with mild to moderate sleep disturbances
may experience irritability and inability to concentrate, which may in turn
affect the patient's compliance with treatment protocols, ability to make
decisions, and relationships with significant others.  Depression and anxiety
can also be caused by sleep disturbances.  Supportive care measures are
directed toward promoting quality of life and adequate rest.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="11157043" MedlineID="21104141">Savard J, Morin CM: Insomnia in the context of cancer: a review of a neglected problem.

of cancer or treatment, measures that control or alleviate symptoms are often
the key to resolving sleep disturbances.  Management of sleep disturbances
combines nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches individualized for the

</Para><SummarySection id="_74"><Title>Nonpharmacologic Management of Sleep Disturbances</Title><Para id="_208">Many people who experience insomnia have been found to practice poor sleep hygiene (such as smoking and drinking excessive alcohol just before  bedtime), which can exacerbate or perpetuate insomnia.<Reference refidx="1"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663087">Level of evidence: III</LOERef>]  Therefore, a complete assessment of sleep hygiene (i.e., time in bed; napping during the day; intake of caffeine, alcohol, or foods that are heavy, spicy, or sugary; exercise; and sleep environment) and use of behavioral management strategies (i.e., fixed bedtime; restrictions on smoking,  diet, and excessive alcohol  4–6 hours before bedtime; and increased exercise) may prove effective in reducing sleep disturbance.</Para><Para id="_209">Sleep hygiene in an inpatient setting involves modifying the sleep environment to decrease sleep disruption.

The interventions were delivered by trained nurses in person, 2 days before the  initiation of chemotherapy and before each chemotherapy treatment and 30 days after the last chemotherapy treatment.  The nurses worked with women assigned to behavioral therapy to individualize and reinforce the behaviors.  The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to measure subjective  sleep quality but was complemented by use of  a sleep diary and 
wrist actigraph.  Sleep quality significantly improved in the group receiving behavioral therapy, compared with the control group.  These differences were also seen in data  from the sleep diary and actigraph, with both showing significantly fewer awakenings in the behavioral therapy group.<Reference refidx="18"/>  Sleep quality was significantly better at 90 days and at 1 year in the behavioral therapy group, as measured by  the PSQI but not the diary or actigraph.<Reference refidx="17"/></Para><Para id="_210">In some places, patients may not have access to in-person, professionally delivered CBT-I because of limited resources.   A randomized controlled trial conducted with breast cancer survivors demonstrated that CBT-I delivered via digital media can also produce meaningful clinical improvements, although improvements are not as robust as those produced with professionally delivered CBT-I. This three-armed trial compared video-based CBT-I (VCBT-I) and professionally delivered CBT-I (PCBT-I) with a no-treatment control group in 242 breast cancer survivors. Both the VCBT-I and PCBT-I groups were associated with significantly greater improvements in diary-measured sleep variables, compared with the control group.

These agents promote sleep by enhancing the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA type A (GABAA) receptor. Unlike traditional benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam), these agents preferentially target specific GABAA receptor subtypes. Zolpidem and zaleplon  bind predominantly to the alpha-1 subtype of GABAA, and eszopiclone preferentially targets the  alpha-3 receptor subtype. This selective receptor subtype targeting has both advantages and disadvantages. These agents have mainly hypnotic/sedative effects and lack the anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and myorelaxant effects seen with benzodiazepines. Conversely, because of the selective receptor subtype targeting, these agents have fewer effects on cognitive, psychomotor function and carry less risk of tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal (especially physical withdrawal) than do benzodiazepines.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/></Para><Para id="_179">These agents may be preferred for use in patients with cancer, when only hypnotic effects are desired,  and should be taken just before bedtime (or even in bed)  because they enter the brain very quickly; some of these agents (e.g., zaleplon) have a short elimination half-life. Because of their longer-lasting effects, zolpidem extended-release and eszopiclone are preferred in the  treatment of  difficulties in staying asleep.

These drugs  include tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline) and second-generation antidepressants (e.g., mirtazapine). The sedating effects of tricyclic antidepressants are caused mainly by  histamine receptor blockading and partially by blockading of 5-HT2 and muscarinic receptors. The sedating effects of mirtazapine are caused by  its blocking of 5-HT2 and histamine receptors, while those of trazodone are caused by  its blocking actions at the at histamine, 5-HT, and noradrenaline receptors.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/></Para><Para id="_167">Tricyclic antidepressants have a small therapeutic window and can be lethal in overdose, compared with second-generation antidepressants such as mirtazapine. Additionally, tricyclics carry other risks, such as risk of weight gain, anticholinergic side effects, and cardiovascular side effects and should be used under close supervision.  These agents sometimes are used in low doses (see Table 2) as adjuncts to other antidepressants in the treatment of insomnia comorbid with depression/anxiety. This helps to avoid the side effects associated with higher doses while delivering the needed sedating effects. Tricyclics can also boost appetite and may be the treatment of choice for insomnia in patients with comorbid cachexia. Certain tricyclics (amitriptyline and nortriptyline) can also be beneficial in the treatment of pain syndromes (e.g., neuropathic pain) and headaches when these issues are comorbid with insomnia. Low doses of antidepressants (subtherapeutic for depression) are frequently used to treat insomnia without any comorbidities.</Para><Para id="_168">Mirtazapine, a second-generation antidepressant, also has appetite-stimulating and antiemetic properties in addition to sedating effects.

nonpharmacologic pain management should be administered before introducing
sleep medications.  Tricyclic antidepressants can be particularly useful for
the treatment of insomnia in patients with neuropathic pain and depression. 
Patients on high-dose opioids for pain may be at increased risk for the
development of delirium and organic mental disorders.  Such patients may
benefit from the use of low-dose neuroleptics as sleep agents (e.g.,
haloperidol 0.5–1 mg).
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_80"><Title>The Older Patient</Title><Para id="_65">Older patients frequently have insomnia due to age-related changes in sleep. 
The sleep cycle in this population is characterized by lighter sleep, more
frequent awakenings, and less total sleep time.  Anxiety, depression, loss of
social support, and a diagnosis of cancer are contributory factors in sleep
disturbances in older patients.<Reference refidx="1"/>
</Para><Para id="_66">Sleep problems in older adults are so common that nearly half of all hypnotic
prescriptions written are for persons older than 65 years.  Although normal
aging affects sleep, the clinician should evaluate the many factors that cause
insomnia, such as medical illness, psychiatric illness, dementia, alcohol
and/or polypharmacy, restless legs syndrome, periodic leg movements, and sleep
apnea syndrome.  Nonpharmacologic treatment of sleep disorders is the preferred
initial management, with the use of medication when indicated and referral to
a sleep disorder center when specialized care is necessary.<Reference refidx="2"/>
</Para><Para id="_67">Providing a regular schedule of meals, discouraging daytime naps, and
encouraging physical activity may improve sleep.  Hypnotic prescriptions for
older patients must be adjusted for variations in metabolism, increased fat
stores, and increased sensitivity.  Dosages should be reduced by 30% to 50%. 
Problems associated with drug accumulation (especially flurazepam) must be
weighed against the risks of more severe withdrawal or rebound effects
associated with short-acting benzodiazepines.  An alternate drug for older
patients is chloral hydrate.<Reference refidx="1"/>
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_81"><Title>Somnolence Syndrome in Children</Title><Para id="_69">Cranial irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate are used to prevent the
development of central nervous system  leukemia in children with acute
lymphocytic leukemia.  Somnolence syndrome (SS) is a complication of
cranial irradiation occurring in 30% to 50% of patients who receive more than 18
Gy at daily dose fractions of 1.5 Gy to 2 Gy.  The syndrome may appear 4 to 6
weeks posttherapy.  SS is characterized by mild drowsiness
to moderate lethargy and, occasionally, low-grade fever.  The pathophysiology
is unknown, but electroencephalogram and cerebral spinal fluid abnormalities
are detectable in affected children.  Although supportive care measures cannot
prevent the occurrence of SS, acknowledgment of the existence of this problem
may prevent or minimize anxieties for children and parents when symptoms of SS
appear.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_82"><Title>Sleep Apnea After Mandibulectomy</Title><Para id="_71">Anterior mandibulectomy can result in the development of sleep apnea.  All
patients with head and neck tumors who have had extensive anterior oral cavity
resection should be evaluated before decannulation of the tracheostomy tube. 
Subsequent flap and/or reconstruction of the lower jaw seems to prevent the
development of sleep apnea.  In contrast, facial sling suspension of the lower
lip does not prevent the development of sleep apnea.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Assessment for
symptoms and preparation for the appearance of symptoms in this population
provide indications for interventions related to sleep apnea.
