Cancer is a life-threatening illness, even though advances in treatments have increased the chances of a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000318813">cure</GlossaryTermRef> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045867">remission</GlossaryTermRef>.  A patient who is diagnosed with cancer may feel fear and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000430405">anxiety</GlossaryTermRef> about  treatments that are often difficult, expensive, and complicated. Decisions about the patient's care can be very hard to make. Good  communication can help patients, families, and doctors make these decisions together and improve the patient's well-being and quality of life. </Para><Para id="_127">  Studies show that when patients and doctors communicate well during cancer care,  there are many positive results. Patients are usually:</Para><ItemizedList id="_8" Style="bullet"> 
    <ListItem>	More satisfied with care and feel more in control.</ListItem> 
    <ListItem>	More likely to follow through with treatment.</ListItem> 
    <ListItem>More informed.</ListItem>

Some patients and families want a lot of detailed information. Others want less detail.   Also, the need for information may change as the patient moves  through diagnosis and treatment. Some patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000478743">advanced disease</GlossaryTermRef> want less information about their <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000651193">condition</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para><Para id="_129">There may be differences in how involved patients and families want to be in making decisions about  cancer care. Some  patients and families may want to be very involved and make their own decisions about cancer care. Others may want to leave decisions to the doctor.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_149"><KeyPoint id="_150">Communication is important at different points during cancer care.</KeyPoint><Para id="_151">Communication is important throughout cancer care, but especially when important decisions are to be made. These important decision times include:</Para><ItemizedList id="_159" Style="bullet"><ListItem>When the patient is first diagnosed.</ListItem><ListItem>Any time new decisions about treatment need to be made.</ListItem><ListItem>After treatment, when discussing how well it worked.</ListItem><ListItem>Whenever the goal of care changes.</ListItem><ListItem>When the patient makes his or her wishes known about <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000430404">advance directives</GlossaryTermRef>, such as a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000441252">living will</GlossaryTermRef>.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_164"><KeyPoint id="_165">End-of life discussions with the health care team may lead to fewer procedures and better quality of life.</KeyPoint><Para id="_166">Studies have shown that cancer patients who have end-of-life discussions with their doctors choose to have fewer procedures, such as resuscitation or the use of a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454512">ventilator</GlossaryTermRef>. They are also less likely to be in intensive care, and the cost of their health care is lower during their final week of life. Reports from their caregivers show that these patients live as long as patients who choose to have more procedures and that they have a better quality of life in their last days.</Para><Para id="_167">This summary is about communication needs in adults and children with cancer.  Section titles show when the information is about children.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_26"><Title>The Role of Family Caregivers</Title><SummarySection id="_27"><KeyPoint id="_130">Family caregivers  are partners    in  communication.</KeyPoint><Para id="_29">
   Families can help patients make better decisions about their <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef> care. Patients and their family members can join together as partners to communicate with the doctor and health care team.  When possible, patients should decide how much help they want from family  members when making decisions. Communication between family <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000648947">caregivers</GlossaryTermRef> and the health care team should continue throughout cancer care. It should include information about the goals of treatment, plans for the patient's care, and what to expect over time. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_131"><KeyPoint id="_132">Communication with the doctor helps   caregivers as well as patients.</KeyPoint><Para id="_133">Communication that includes the patient and family is called family-centered communication. Family-centered communication with the doctor helps the family understand its role in caregiving. Family caregivers who get specific and practical direction from the health care team are more confident about giving care. When caregivers receive this help, they can give the patient better care.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_152"><KeyPoint id="_153">Language and culture can affect communication.</KeyPoint><Para id="_154">Communication can be more difficult if the doctor does not speak the same language as the patient and family, or if there are <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000476357">cultural</GlossaryTermRef> differences. Every patient with cancer has the right to get clear information about the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046450">diagnosis</GlossaryTermRef> and treatment so he or she can take full part in making decisions. Most medical centers have trained interpreters or have other ways to help with language differences. </Para><Para id="_163">If cultural beliefs will affect decisions about treatment and care, the health care team should be told about these beliefs. For example, a common Western belief is that an informed patient should make the final decision about cancer care.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_155"><KeyPoint id="_156">There may be problems with communication.</KeyPoint><Para id="_162">There are many things that can block communication between the patient and doctor. This can happen if:</Para><ItemizedList id="_160" Style="bullet"><ListItem>The patient does not fully understand all the facts about treatment.</ListItem><ListItem>The medical information is not given in a way the patient can understand.</ListItem><ListItem>The patient believes the doctor will tell them the important facts about treatment and doesn't ask questions.</ListItem><ListItem>The patient is afraid to ask too many questions.</ListItem><ListItem>The patient is afraid to take too much of the doctor's time and doesn't ask questions.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_157"> Family caregivers can sometimes help when communication problems come up.</Para><Para id="_168">For more information see the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044271">PDQ</GlossaryTermRef> summary <SummaryRef href="CDR0000682690" url="/about-cancer/coping/family-friends/family-caregivers-pdq">Family Caregivers in Cancer</SummaryRef>.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_50"><Title>The Role of Parents</Title><SummarySection id="_136"><KeyPoint id="_137">Children with cancer need information that is right for their age.</KeyPoint><Para id="_138">Studies show that children with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef> want to know about their illness and how it will be treated. The amount of information a child wants  depends in part on his or her age. Most children worry about how their illness and treatment will affect their daily lives and the people around them. Studies also show that children have less doubt and fear when they are given information about their illness, even if it is bad news.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_139"><KeyPoint id="_140">There are many ways for parents to communicate with their child.</KeyPoint><Para id="_141">When a child is seriously ill, parents may find that communication is better when they:</Para><ItemizedList id="_135" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Talk with the doctor at the beginning of cancer care about open communication with their child and other family members. Parents should discuss how the family feels about sharing medical information with their child, and talk about any concerns they  have. </ListItem><ListItem>Talk with their child and share information throughout the course of the illness.</ListItem><ListItem>	Find out what their child already knows and wants to know about the illness.

The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/espanol/recursos/pdq">Spanish</ExternalRef>.</Para><Para id="_AboutThis_4">PDQ is a service of the NCI.

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_AboutThis_10"><Title>Clinical Trial Information</Title><Para id="_AboutThis_11">A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
