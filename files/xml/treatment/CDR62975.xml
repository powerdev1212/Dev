More than 400 hydrazine <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044919">analogs</GlossaryTermRef> (related
compounds) have been screened for their ability to kill <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumors</GlossaryTermRef>.  In 1996, a
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044120">retrospective</GlossaryTermRef> review of scientific
studies in which the anticancer activity of hydrazine analogs was investigated
found that 65 of 82 evaluated compounds showed some anticancer activity in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044095">xenograft</GlossaryTermRef> models (tumor cells of one
species transplanted to another species).<Reference refidx="1"/>  Of the 82
tested compounds, seven showed activity against human tumor cells and were,
therefore, selected for further testing in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045838">pilot studies</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045830">phase I clinical trials</GlossaryTermRef>.

view of the initial success with procarbazine, hydrazine sulfate, which is
similar in chemical composition, was investigated for anticancer activity
beginning in the 1970s.  During this period, investigation of hydrazine
sulfate as a treatment for cancer-related <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044108">cachexia</GlossaryTermRef> was also initiated.

with purified <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044393">DNA</GlossaryTermRef> in the laboratory, they produce <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044113">hydrogen peroxide</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044030">free radicals</GlossaryTermRef> that can damage the

explain its potential antitumor and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044104">anticachexia</GlossaryTermRef> properties.  Both
mechanisms involve the utilization of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044033">glucose</GlossaryTermRef> (sugar), which tumors require as
a main source of energy for growth.  In one proposed mechanism, hydrazine
sulfate blocks <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044111">gluconeogenesis</GlossaryTermRef>
through inhibition of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046081">enzyme</GlossaryTermRef>
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.<Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/>  Gluconeogenesis is
a process by which extra glucose (in addition to that obtained from the diet)
can be formed in the liver and the kidneys from the breakdown products of 
sugars, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046068">lipids</GlossaryTermRef> (fats), and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046092">proteins</GlossaryTermRef>.  It has been suggested that
cachexia occurs because the body must use increasing amounts of energy and
other resources, including its own protein, to meet the demand for glucose by
tumors.<Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/>  Blocking gluconeogenesis and interfering with
the supply of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044697">nutrients</GlossaryTermRef> to tumors has been proposed as one way to inhibit
tumor growth and to prevent  cachexia.</Para><Para id="_14">In the second proposed mechanism, hydrazine sulfate inhibits <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045290">tumor necrosis factor</GlossaryTermRef> (TNF)-alpha activity.<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/>  TNF-alpha, which is also known as cachectin, is
one of a number of substances normally produced by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045993">white blood cells</GlossaryTermRef> in the
body in response to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045364">infection</GlossaryTermRef> by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044059">microorganisms</GlossaryTermRef> and in response to
other stimuli such as tissue damage.<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="34"/><Reference refidx="35"/><Reference refidx="36"/>  Higher-than-normal TNF-alpha production has been observed in white blood cells obtained
from cancer patients.  It has been suggested that higher-than-normal levels of TNF-alpha can cause the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044103">anorexia</GlossaryTermRef>,  increased energy
expenditure, and  increased muscle protein breakdown seen in cancer
patients.<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="35"/><Reference refidx="36"/><Reference refidx="37"/>  Some of the muscle protein breakdown products
would become available for gluconeogenesis.  Inhibition of TNF-alpha activity
might, therefore, inhibit tumor growth and prevent cachexia.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="8726813" MedlineID="96326931">Toth B: A review of the antineoplastic action of certain hydrazines and hydrazine-containing natural products.

that 14 had <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000335101">objective improvements</GlossaryTermRef> (i.e., there was measurable tumor <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046039">regression</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045884">stable disease</GlossaryTermRef>, or improvement in a
cancer-related disorder) in response to treatment with hydrazine sulfate. 
Among the patients with objective responses, two had long-term (17 and 18
months) stabilization of their disease and seven had measurable tumor
regression, although the extent and duration of these  regressions were not
specified.  Major weaknesses of this study included the absence of a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044149">control</GlossaryTermRef>
(i.e., comparison) group and the fact that 74 of the 158 initially recruited

their treatment histories.  In addition, insufficient information was given
about study design and methodology.  The absence of control groups; the
receipt of prior or concurrent surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy
by all patients; and the reliance on subjective measures of  quality of life
are major study weaknesses.  Therefore, it is difficult to ascribe any of the
positive findings to treatment with hydrazine sulfate. In contrast with the

no complete responses or partial responses among a total of 79 patients

chemotherapy <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045864">regimen</GlossaryTermRef>.  When all patients were evaluated, no improvement in
survival was found with hydrazine sulfate therapy.  In addition, no
differences were noted in objective tumor response between the hydrazine

of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044122">serum albumin</GlossaryTermRef> levels, the
nutritional status of the patients in the hydrazine sulfate group was judged
better than that of the patients in the placebo group.  However, the moderate

the patients who received hydrazine sulfate had, on average, shorter survival
than the patients who received placebo, a finding that was statistically
significant.  There were no statistically significant differences between the

hydrazine sulfate therapy.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/>  These trials had either nutritional
status or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044056">metabolic</GlossaryTermRef> status as the primary endpoint.  In a placebo-controlled,
randomized trial involving 38 patients with advanced disease, hydrazine
sulfate was found to improve the abnormal <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044033">glucose</GlossaryTermRef> metabolism seen in cancer patients.<Reference refidx="13"/> 
In another placebo-controlled, randomized trial that involved 101 patients
with advanced cancer and weight loss, the use of hydrazine sulfate was
associated with statistically significant improvements in appetite and either
weight increase or weight maintenance.<Reference refidx="12"/>  However, the higher average
caloric intake observed in this study for patients treated with hydrazine
sulfate compared with patients treated with placebo was not statistically
significant.<Reference refidx="12"/>  Two other clinical studies involving a total of 34 patients
with either <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000270740">lung</GlossaryTermRef> cancer or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046462">colon</GlossaryTermRef> cancer found that hydrazine sulfate was able
