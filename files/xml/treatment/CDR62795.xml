neuroblastomas.  About one quarter of cancers in the first year of life are
neuroblastomas, making this the most frequent histological type of infant
cancer.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>  The incidence rate of the disease in children younger than 1 year 
is about 35 per million but declines rapidly with age to about 1 per million
between ages 10 and 14 years.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Males appear to be affected slightly more commonly
than females, with about five cases occurring in boys to every four occurring in
girls.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_13"><Title>Screening Method and Sensitivity</Title><Para id="_14">The risk factors for and causes of neuroblastoma have not been
established, and therefore it is not possible to provide information or advice for the
primary prevention of this disease.  It is generally thought that many
neuroblastomas are present and detectable at birth, thereby allowing for
detection of tumors by a single, once-in-a-lifetime screening test, such as
those used for neonatal screening for noncancerous conditions (e.g.,
phenylketonuria).  Screening is performed through biochemical tests for
metabolites of norepinephrine and dopamine (i.e., vanillylmandelic acid [VMA],
and homovanillic acid [HVA]).  Seventy-five percent to 90% of cases of
neuroblastoma excrete these substances into the urine, which can be
measured in urine specimens.<Reference refidx="4"/>  There is no known optimal age for screening,
but the most commonly discussed and studied age for a one-time screen has been
6 months.   Screening at 12 months  has also been evaluated in a population-based study in Germany.<Reference refidx="5"/> Approximately 65% of cases are present before 6 months.<Reference refidx="6"/>  Furthermore, the clinical significance of  screen-detected
neuroblastomas is in question since stage I and II localized tumors less than 5 cm
have been observed to regress without treatment in an observational study.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_15">Testing of liquid urine samples or of samples collected on filter paper for VMA
and HVA is possible.<Reference refidx="8"/>  The first attempts to conduct mass screening through
urinary testing occurred in Japan in the early 1970s.<Reference refidx="9"/>  The VMA and HVA
levels are usually measured by gas chromatography, thin layer chromatography,
and/or high performance liquid chromatography.
</Para><Para id="_16">There are no standard cut-off levels between positive and negative VMA and HVA
tests.  One recommendation is to use a VMA cut-off level of 25 μg/mg creatinine and
an HVA cut-off level of 32 μg/mg creatinine.  Alternatively, individual laboratories
use a level of two standard deviations above that laboratory’s age-specific mean
to identify specimens for reanalysis.  On reanalysis, a level of three standard
deviations above the mean is used to determine the need for diagnostic
evaluation.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_17">The sensitivity of the screening procedure used in different studies ranges
from 40% to 80%.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/>  False-positives can be caused by dietary agents such
as bananas and vanilla <Reference refidx="14"/> but are rare with quantitative assays such as gas
chromatography (specificity approximates 99.9%).<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="15"/>  Because of the low
prevalence of the disease, even in the Quebec Neuroblastoma Screening Project
in which the specificity of the test was extremely high, the positive-predictive value was only 52%,<Reference refidx="11"/> i.e., for every two children identified by
screening as being likely to have neuroblastoma, only one was actually affected. 
In the German Neuroblastoma Screening Project, the positive-predictive value has been reported as only 8.4%.<Reference refidx="5"/> False-positive cases are generally followed for prolonged periods with serial
noninvasive testing before a definitive diagnosis excluding cancer can be
offered to the parents.<Reference refidx="16"/>

national programs in Japan, uncontrolled pilot experiences at a number of sites
in Europe and the United States, and  population-based studies in Canada and Germany.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>
<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_50">An increase in survival rates among screen-detected cases would be expected if
screening was detecting neuroblastoma at an earlier and more curable stage. 
While improved survival rates after initiation of screening have been
reported,<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/> these observations should be viewed cautiously because
improvements could be caused by  lead-time bias,  length bias, and identification of cases through screening that would have spontaneously
regressed.
</Para><Para id="_20">Screening results in an increased incidence of early-stage disease.  The cases
detected by screening almost exclusively have biologically favorable properties
(unamplified N-myc oncogene, near triploidy, and favorable histology), and this
type of favorable neuroblastoma has a high survival rate, whether detected by
screening or detected clinically.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/>      There is evidence that some
tumors regress spontaneously in the absence of treatment.<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/>
</Para><Para id="_51">Some authors have argued that the Japanese experience
shows that the number of children older than  1 year,    who are diagnosed with
neuroblastoma, may have decreased since the inception of screening <Reference refidx="22"/> and that
overall mortality has declined during this period.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="23"/>  A true reduction in
neuroblastoma mortality may reflect improvements in treatment efficacy as much
as a benefit of treating earlier-stage disease.  Mortality has decreased in
other countries where screening does not occur.<Reference refidx="24"/> In another study of regional comparisons, disease rates were compared between Osaka, Japan, where screenings were initiated in 1985, and Great Britain, where screening was not done.<Reference refidx="25"/>  There was little change during this time in the cumulative mortality rates in either region; 52 versus 57.5 per million between 1970 and 1979 versus 1991 and 1994 in Osaka, compared with 78.6 versus 70.1 in the corresponding periods in Great Britain. In any case,    the majority of cases detected by screening at 6 months  appear to have biologically
favorable prognoses independent of stage.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/>  Furthermore, despite the
shift in stage distribution of cases detected by screening compared with those
that are routinely detected, the evidence of reduction in the incidence of
advanced-stage cancers in the Japanese experience has been disputed;<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="30"/>
 in the Quebec Project, as noted below, no such reduction is observed.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_71">A study of mortality trends before and after the national mass screening program in Japan for neuroblastoma analyzed age-specific mortality rates  from 1980 through 2006.  Screening began in the mid-1980s and was halted in 2003.  Mortality rates were either stable through the entire period for age groups 5 years to 9 years and 10 years to 14 years, or were declining before the initiation of screening and continued to do so through 2006 for age groups less than 1    year and 1 year to 4 years.  Because the most recent year of death analyzed was 2006, any increase in age-specific mortality associated with the cessation of mass screening in 2003 would have been expected to occur among children aged less than 1 year or 1 year to 4 years.  No such increase was observed. This is the first postscreening analysis to provide evidence that screening had no impact on mortality rates and that stopping screening had no adverse effect.<Reference refidx="31"/></Para><Para id="_74">A study compared neuroblastoma incidence and mortality rates in Japan in three cohorts: children born before screening between 1980 and 1983, and those born during screening between 1986 and 1989, and between 1990 and 1998.<Reference refidx="32"/> Cumulative incidence was higher in the screened cohorts (21.56–29.80 cases per 100,000 births) compared with the prescreening cohort (11.56 cases). Cumulative mortality was lower in the screened cohorts compared with  the prescreening cohort (3.90–2.83 vs. 5.38 deaths per 100,000 births). The impact of changes in treatment on these rates is unclear.</Para><Para id="_21">The Quebec Neuroblastoma Screening Project  compared neuroblastoma incidence
and mortality in a 5-year birth cohort (n = 476,603) from Quebec (where urinary
screening was offered at 3 weeks  and 6 months [overall compliance, 92%]) to various North American birth cohorts in which no screening took
place.  In  this study, the incidence of early-stage disease in children younger than
1 year in the screened population more than doubled that expected, while in the
control population, it approximated that expected (standardized incidence ratio,
3.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.30–3.86) in Quebec versus 0.82 in
Minnesota (95% CI, 0.41–1.38) and Ontario (95% CI, 0.53–1.17).<Reference refidx="1"/>  The incidence
of advanced-stage disease (stage III and stage IV) in older children in Quebec
showed a statistically nonsignificant increase over that which would have been
expected (standard incidence ratio, 1.52;  95% CI, 0.95–2.23).<Reference refidx="1"/>   After approximately 8 years of follow-up (range 6–11 years) the neuroblastoma death rate in the screened population was not significantly different from rates in unscreened populations (standardized mortality ratio, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.64–1.92] for the Quebec cohort compared with Ontario children).<Reference refidx="7"/> Similar findings were observed in the German neuroblastoma study.<Reference refidx="33"/> Although final mortality rates are  expected in 2008, an interim analysis shows that the death rate from neuroblastoma is similar in screened and control populations (1.6 vs. 1.9 deaths per 100,000 children).


A study in Austria  yielded a similar conclusion, though screening was performed at age 7 to 12 months. In the screening cohort, neuroblastoma incidence was statistically significantly higher than in children who were not screened  (18.2 vs. 11.2 per 100,000 births), while mortality was not statistically significantly different (0.96 vs. 1.57 per 100,000 births).<Reference refidx="34"/></Para><Para id="_24">There is  no evidence from controlled studies or randomized trials of
decreases in mortality associated with screening.
