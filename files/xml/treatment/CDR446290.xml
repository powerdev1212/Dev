Its chemical structure was determined in 1958.  Interest in CoQ10 as a possible treatment for cancer began in 1961, when it was found that some cancer patients had a lower than normal amount of it  in their <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000270735">blood</GlossaryTermRef>.  Low blood levels of CoQ10 have been found in patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045795">myeloma</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045368">lymphoma</GlossaryTermRef>, and cancers of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000304766">breast</GlossaryTermRef>, lung, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046539">prostate</GlossaryTermRef>, pancreas, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046462">colon</GlossaryTermRef>, kidney, and head and neck.</Para><Para id="_63">Research about how CoQ10 plays a key role in the way cells make energy was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1978. </Para><Para id="_12">  Studies suggest that CoQ10 may help the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356">immune system</GlossaryTermRef> work better.   Partly because of this, CoQ10 is used as  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045587">adjuvant therapy</GlossaryTermRef> for cancer.  Adjuvant therapy is treatment given following the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000589417">primary treatment</GlossaryTermRef> to lower the risk that the cancer will come back.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_32"><Question>What is the theory behind the claim that CoQ10 is useful in treating cancer?</Question><Answer><Para id="_34">CoQ10 may be useful in treating cancer because it boosts the immune system.

Research in a laboratory or using animals is done to find out if a drug, procedure, or treatment is likely to be useful in humans. These preclinical studies are done before any testing in humans is begun. Most <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044512">laboratory studies</GlossaryTermRef> of  CoQ10 have looked at  its chemical structure and how it works in the body.

</Question><Answer><Para id="_39">There have been no well-designed <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045961">clinical trials</GlossaryTermRef> involving large numbers of patients to study the use of CoQ10 in cancer treatment. There have been some clinical trials with small numbers of people, but  the way the studies were done and the amount of information reported made it unclear if benefits were caused by the CoQ10 or by something else. Most of the trials were not <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045858">randomized</GlossaryTermRef> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044014">controlled</GlossaryTermRef>. Randomized controlled trials give the highest level of evidence:</Para><ItemizedList id="_47" Style="bullet"><ListItem> In randomized trials, volunteers are assigned randomly (by chance) to one of 2 or more groups that compare different factors related to the treatment. </ListItem><ListItem>In controlled trials, one group (called the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044149">control group</GlossaryTermRef>) does not receive the new treatment being studied.

During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.

A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_4">Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_5">Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. </Para></SummarySection> 
  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_6"><Title>Evaluation of CAM Approaches</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_7">It is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute  and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_8">Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH)  in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.</Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_9"><ExternalRef xref="http://cam.cancer.gov/cam/best_case_intro.html">The NCI Best Case Series Program</ExternalRef>   which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.</Para></SummarySection>
