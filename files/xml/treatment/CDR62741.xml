a shift in histologic type and primary tumor location.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>  Adenocarcinoma of
the esophagus is now more prevalent than squamous cell carcinoma in the United
States and western Europe, with most tumors located in the distal esophagus. 
The cause for the rising incidence and demographic alterations is unknown.  
</Para><SummarySection id="_243"><Title>Risk Factors and Survival</Title><Para id="_5">While risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus have been
identified (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, diet), the risk factors associated with
esophageal adenocarcinoma are less clear.<Reference refidx="3"/>  The presence of Barrett
esophagus is associated with an increased risk of developing adenocarcinoma of
the esophagus, and chronic reflux is considered the predominant cause of
Barrett metaplasia.  The results of a population-based, case-controlled study
from Sweden strongly suggest that symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux is a risk
factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma.  The frequency, severity, and duration of
reflux symptoms were positively correlated with increased risk of esophageal
adenocarcinoma.<Reference refidx="4"/>
</Para><Para id="_6">Esophageal cancer is a treatable disease, but it is rarely curable.  The overall
5-year survival rate in patients amenable to definitive treatment ranges from 5% to 30%. 
The occasional patient with very early disease has a better chance of survival. 
Patients with severe dysplasia in distal esophageal Barrett mucosa often have
<Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> or even invasive cancer within the dysplastic area.  Following
resection, these patients usually have excellent prognoses.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_244"><Title>Treatment Modalities</Title><Para id="_7">Primary treatment modalities include surgery alone or chemotherapy with
radiation therapy.  Combined modality therapy (i.e., chemotherapy plus surgery, or
chemotherapy and radiation therapy plus surgery) is under clinical evaluation. 
Effective palliation may be obtained in individual cases with various
combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, stents,<Reference refidx="5"/> and endoscopic therapy with Nd:YAG laser.<Reference refidx="6"/>
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_245"><Title>Diagnostics for Staging</Title><Para id="_8">One of the major difficulties in allocating and comparing treatment modalities
for patients with esophageal cancer is the lack of precise preoperative
staging.  Standard noninvasive staging modalities include computed tomography
(CT) of the chest and abdomen and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS).  The overall
tumor depth staging accuracy of EUS is 85% to 90%, as compared with 50% to 80%
for CT; the accuracy of regional nodal staging is 70% to 80% for EUS and 50% to
70% for CT.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/>  EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for lymph node
staging is under prospective evaluation; one  retrospective series reported a
93% sensitivity and 100% specificity of regional nodal staging with EUS-FNA.<Reference refidx="9"/>  Thoracoscopy and
laparoscopy have been used in esophageal cancer staging at some surgical
centers.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/>   An intergroup trial reported an increase in positive lymph node detection to 56% of 107 evaluable patients using thoracoscopy/laparoscopy, from 41% (using noninvasive staging tests, e.g., CT, magnetic resonance imaging, EUS) with no major complications or deaths.<Reference refidx="13"/> Noninvasive positron emission tomography using the
radiolabeled glucose analog 18-F-fluorodeoxy-D-glucose for preoperative
staging of esophageal cancer is under clinical evaluation and may be useful in
detecting stage IV disease.<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/>

suggests that Barrett esophagus is a premalignant condition.  Strong
consideration should be given to resection in patients with high-grade
dysplasia in the setting of Barrett metaplasia.  Endoscopic surveillance of
patients with Barrett metaplasia may detect adenocarcinoma at an earlier
stage more amenable to curative resection.<Reference refidx="1"/>  The survival rate of patients
with esophageal cancer is poor.  Asymptomatic small tumors confined to the
esophageal mucosa or submucosa are detected only by chance.  Surgery is the
treatment of choice for these small tumors.  Once symptoms are present
(e.g., dysphagia, in most cases), esophageal cancers have usually invaded
the muscularis propria or beyond and may have metastasized to lymph nodes or
other organs.
</Para><Para id="_46">In the presence of complete esophageal obstruction without clinical evidence
of systemic metastasis, surgical excision of the tumor with mobilization of the
stomach to replace the esophagus has been the traditional means of relieving
the dysphagia.  In the United States, the median age of patients who present
with esophageal cancer is 67 years.<Reference refidx="2"/>  The results of a retrospective
review of 505 consecutive patients who were operated on by a single surgical
team over 17 years found no difference in the perioperative mortality, median
survival, or palliative benefit of esophagectomy on dysphagia when the group of
patients older than 70 years were compared to their younger peers.<Reference refidx="3"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335144">Levels of
evidence: 3iiA</LOERef> and <LOERef href="CDR0000335145"> 3iiB</LOERef>]  All of the patients in this series were selected for
surgery on the basis of potential operative risk.  Age alone should not determine
therapy for patients with potentially resectable disease.
</Para><Para id="_47">The optimal surgical procedure is controversial.  One approach
advocates transhiatal esophagectomy with anastomosis of the stomach to the
cervical esophagus.  A second approach advocates abdominal mobilization of the
stomach and transthoracic excision of the esophagus with anastomosis of the
stomach to the upper thoracic esophagus or the cervical esophagus.

In an attempt to avoid this perioperative mortality and to relieve dysphagia,
definitive radiation therapy in combination with chemotherapy has been studied. 
A Radiation Therapy Oncology Group randomized trial (RTOG-8501) of chemotherapy and radiation therapy versus radiation therapy
alone resulted in an improvement in 5-year survival for the combined modality

 Although originally designed to accrue 298 patients, this trial  was closed in 1999 after a planned interim analysis showed that it was statistically unlikely that there would be any advantage to using high-dose radiation.
