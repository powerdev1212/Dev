squamous dysplasia.  The prevailing evidence favors human papillomavirus (HPV)
as a causative factor in many genital tract carcinomas.<Reference refidx="10"/>  The HPV-related basaloid and warty types are associated with VIN.  About 75% to 100% of basaloid and warty carcinomas harbor HPV infection. In addition to the much higher prevalence of HPV in these subtypes than in the keratinizing subtypes, the basaloid and warty subtypes also share many common risk factors with cervical cancers, including multiplicity of sex partners, early age at initiation of sexual intercourse, and history of abnormal Pap smears.<Reference refidx="11"/>  HPV-associated VIN (termed usual-type VIN when high-grade 2 and 3) is most common in women younger than 50  years, whereas non-HPV VIN (termed differentiated-type VIN when high-grade 3) is most common in older women.  The former lesion-type VIN grade 1 is no longer classified as a true VIN.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_404"><Title>Histopathology</Title><Para id="_406">The pattern of spread is influenced by the histology.  Well-differentiated
lesions tend to spread along the surface with minimal invasion, whereas
anaplastic lesions are more likely to be deeply invasive.  Spread beyond the
vulva is either to adjacent organs such as the vagina, urethra, and anus, or
via the lymphatics to the inguinal and femoral lymph nodes, followed by the deep
pelvic nodes.  Hematogenous spread appears to be uncommon.

However, the different surgical techniques have not been directly compared in randomized controlled trials.  In addition, even the nonrandomized studies suffer from lack of uniform staging definitions and clear descriptions of lymph node dissection or ancillary radiation.<Reference refidx="6"/>[Levels of evidence: <LOERef href="CDR0000335155">3iiiDii</LOERef>, <LOERef href="CDR0000587991">3iiiDiv</LOERef>] The evidence base is therefore limited.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_372"><Title>Nodal surgery</Title><Para id="_373">Another strategy to minimize the morbidity incurred by groin-node dissection in patients with early clinical-stage disease is sentinel node dissection, reserving groin dissection for those with metastases to the sentinel node(s).  </Para><Para id="_374">In a multicenter case series, 403 patients with primary vulvar squamous cell cancers smaller than 4 cm and clinically negative groin nodes underwent 623 sentinel node dissections using radioactive tracer and blue dye for sentinel node identification.<Reference refidx="7"/> All patients had radical resection of the primary tumor.

After two local recurrences in 17 patients with multifocal primary tumors, the protocol was amended to only allow patients with unifocal tumors into the study.

However, a major cause of morbidity after surgery is groin node dissection, which is associated with high rates of wound breakdown, lymphocele formation, and chronic lymphedema.

However, there is little evidence that all three grades are part of the same biologic continuum or that Grade 1 is even a cancer precursor.  In 2004, the International Society for the Study of Vulvar Disease changed its terminology, reserving the designation VIN for two categories of lesions based on morphologic appearance:<Reference refidx="1"/> </Para><OrderedList id="_217" Style="Arabic"><ListItem> Usual-type VIN:  Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated Grades 2 and 3 of warty, basaloid, or mixed histology, and usually occurring in young women.</ListItem><ListItem>Differentiated-type VIN: non-HPV-associated Grade 3, and usually occurring in older women.  </ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_218"> The term VIN 1 was eliminated.<Reference refidx="1"/> Disease that was previously called VIN 1 (grade I) is generally observed without definitive treatment.</Para><Para id="_219">High-grade VIN is usually managed with active therapy because of a higher risk for progression to invasive disease.<Reference refidx="2"/>  Estimates of progression rates are imprecise.  A systematic literature review that included 88 untreated patients with VIN 3 reported a 9% progression rate (8 of 88 patients) to invasive vulvar cancer during 12 to 96 months of observation.  In the same review, the spontaneous regression rate was 1.2%, all of which occurred in women younger than 35 years.<Reference refidx="3"/>  However, in a single-center study, 10 of 63 (16%) untreated women with VIN 2 or VIN 3 progressed to invasive cancer after a mean of 3.9 years.<Reference refidx="4"/>  </Para><Para id="_220">VIN lesions may be multifocal or confluent and extensive.  It is important to perform multiple biopsies in treatment planning to exclude occult invasive disease. VIN located in nonhairy areas can be considered an epithelial disease; however, VIN occupying hairy sites usually involves the pilosebaceous apparatus and requires a greater depth of destruction or excision because it can track along hair roots. </Para><SummarySection id="_221"><Title>Surgical Interventions</Title><Para id="_400">The principal treatment approach is surgical, but there is no consensus on the optimal surgical procedure.  The goal is to remove or destroy the entire VIN lesion while preserving vulvar anatomy and function. Simple vulvectomy yields a 5-year survival rate of essentially 100% but is
seldom indicated.  Other more-limited surgical procedures, including separate excision of multiple lesions, are less deforming.<Reference refidx="5"/>  The choice of treatment depends on the extent of the disease and the preference or experience of the treating physician.  There are no reliable data comparing the efficacy and safety of the various surgical approaches.</Para><Para id="_71">  A systematic literature review identified only a single randomized trial comparing any of the surgical approaches.<Reference refidx="2"/>  In that trial, 30 women with high-grade VIN were randomly assigned to receive carbon dioxide (CO<Subscript>2</Subscript>) laser ablation versus ultrasound surgical aspiration (USA).<Reference refidx="6"/>  There were no statistically significant differences in disease recurrence, painful  dysuria or burning, adhesions, or eschar formation between the two treatments after 1 year of follow-up.  Scarring was observed in 5 of 16 women treated with laser ablation and 0 of14 women treated with USA (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .01), but consequences of the scarring on sexual function or quality of life were not reported.<Reference refidx="6"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335129">Level of evidence 1iiDii</LOERef>]   The trial was too small to draw reliable conclusions about the relative efficacy of these surgical techniques.

Some of these approaches, including topical 5-fluorouracil, gamma-interferon, bleomycin, and trinitrochlorobenzene, have been largely abandoned because of   intolerable local side effects, such as pain, irritation, and ulceration, or high recurrence rates.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/>  Photodynamic therapy, using topically applied 5-aminolevulinic acid as the sensitizing agent for 635 nm laser light, has also been studied.
