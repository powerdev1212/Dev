In an effort to reduce and prevent late effects, contemporary therapy for most pediatric malignancies has evolved to a risk-adapted approach that is assigned based on a variety of clinical, biological, and sometimes genetic factors.  With the exception of survivors requiring intensive multimodality therapy for aggressive or refractory/relapsed malignancies, life-threatening treatment effects are relatively uncommon after contemporary therapy in early follow-up (up to 10 years after diagnosis).  However, survivors still frequently experience life-altering morbidity related to effects of cancer treatment on endocrine, reproductive, musculoskeletal, and neurologic function.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_121"><Title>Mortality</Title><Para id="_122">Late effects also contribute to an excess risk of premature death among long-term survivors of childhood cancer.  Several studies of very large cohorts of survivors have reported early mortality among individuals treated for childhood cancer compared with age- and gender-matched general population controls. Relapsed/refractory primary cancer remains the most frequent cause of death, followed by excess cause-specific mortality from subsequent primary cancers and cardiac and pulmonary toxicity.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/>; <Reference refidx="21"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335138">Level of evidence: 3iA</LOERef>] </Para><Para id="_1086">Despite high premature morbidity rates,  overall mortality has decreased over time.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="22"/> This reduction is related to a decrease in deaths from the primary cancer without an associated increase in mortality from subsequent cancers or treatment-related toxicities. The former reflects improvements in therapeutic efficacy, and the latter reflects changes in therapy made subsequent to studying the causes of late effects. The expectation that mortality rates in survivors will continue to exceed those in the general population is based on the long-term sequelae that are likely to increase with attained age. If patients treated on therapeutic protocols are followed up for long periods into adulthood, it will be possible to evaluate the excess lifetime mortality in relation to specific therapeutic interventions.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_280"><Title>Monitoring for Late Effects</Title><Para id="_281">Recognition of both acute and late modality–specific toxicity has motivated investigations evaluating the pathophysiology and prognostic factors for cancer treatment–related effects.

</Para><Para id="_1364">Overall, there has been a wealth of studies focused on the topic of cardiac events among childhood cancer survivors.

However, even with decades of follow-up, the average age of these populations may still be relatively young (middle or young adulthood). And while the risk of serious cardiovascular outcomes may be very high relative to the age-matched general population, the absolute risk often remains low, limiting the power of many studies. Among the very large studies featuring thousands of survivors, the main limitation has been inadequate ability to clinically ascertain late cardiovascular complications, with a greater reliance on either administrative records (e.g., death registries) and/or self-report or proxy-report.  </Para><Para id="_1365">While each study design has some inherent biases, the cumulative literature, based on a combination of self-reported outcomes, clinical ascertainment, and administrative data sources, is robust in concluding that certain cancer-related exposures predispose survivors towards a significantly greater risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although late effects research often lags behind changes in contemporary therapy, many therapies linked to cardiovascular late effects remain in common use today.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/> Ongoing research will be important to ensure that newer <Emphasis>targeted</Emphasis> agents being introduced today do not result in unexpected cardiovascular effects.<Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Para id="_1423">Results of selected cohort studies describing the prevalence of cardiovascular outcomes include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_1424" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem> Austrian-German investigators evaluated the development of cardiac disease (via patient self-report supplemented by physician report) in a cohort of 1,132 pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors monitored for a median of 20 years. The 25-year cumulative incidence of heart disease increased with higher mediastinal radiation doses: 3% (unirradiated), 5% (20 Gy), 6% (25 Gy), 10% (30 Gy), and 21% (36 Gy). Valve defects were most common, followed by coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, rhythm disorders, and pericardial abnormalities.<Reference refidx="16"/></ListItem><ListItem>In a Dutch hospital-based cohort of 1,362 5-year childhood cancer survivors (median attained age, 29.1 years; median follow-up time from diagnosis, 22.2 years), the 30-year cause-specific cumulative incidence of symptomatic cardiac events (congestive heart failure, cardiac ischemia, valve disease, arrhythmia, and/or pericarditis) was significantly increased after treatment with both anthracyclines and cardiac radiation (12.6%; 95% CI, 4.3–10.3), anthracyclines alone (7.3%; 95% CI, 3.8–10.7), and  cardiac radiation alone (4.0%; 95% CI, 0.5–7.4) compared with other treatments. There appeared to be an exponential relationship between cumulative anthracycline dose, cardiac radiation dose, and the risk of developing a symptomatic cardiac event.<Reference refidx="11"/></ListItem><ListItem>A report from the CCSS that featured over 14,000 5-year survivors examined detailed dose-response to both radiation therapy and chemotherapy (anthracycline) in relation to self-reported (or death due to) myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, pericardial disease, and valvular abnormalities. Cardiac radiation doses of 15 Gy or higher were associated with substantially greater risk compared with the risk seen in nonirradiated survivors, while anthracycline doses of 250 mg/m<Superscript>2</Superscript> or more were associated with a substantially increased risk of congestive heart failure, pericardial disease, and valvular abnormalities, independent of radiation exposure. Overall, the cumulative incidence of adverse cardiac outcomes continued to rise more than 30 years after original cancer diagnosis.<Reference refidx="10"/> </ListItem><ListItem>A follow-up study from the CCSS  demonstrated that the cumulative incidence of these serious cardiac events continued to increase beyond age 45 years. Furthermore, the risk of these events was potentiated (i.e., beyond what would be expected by an additive model) by the presence of concurrent, but potentially modifiable, conditions such as obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and, in particular, hypertension. Hypertension was independently associated with all serious cardiac outcomes (RRs, 6-fold to 19-fold), even after adjustment for anthracycline use and chest irradiation.<Reference refidx="6"/></ListItem><ListItem>Using data from four large, well-annotated childhood cancer survivor cohorts (CCSS and data from the National Wilms Tumor Study Group, the Netherlands, and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital), a heart failure risk calculator based on readily available demographic and treatment characteristics has been created and validated, which may provide more individualized clinical heart failure risk estimation for 5-year survivors of childhood cancer who have recently completed therapy and up through age 40 years.

Evidence for adverse psychosocial adjustment after childhood cancer has been derived from a spectrum of sources, ranging from patient-reported or proxy-reported outcomes to data from population-based registries.  The former may be limited by small sample size, cohort selection and participation bias, and variable methods and venues (clinical vs. distance-based survey) of assessments.  The latter is often not well correlated with clinical and treatment characteristics that permit the identification of survivors at high risk of psychosocial deficits.</Para><Para id="_1352">Survivors with neurocognitive deficits are particularly vulnerable to adverse psychosocial outcomes that affect achievement of expected social competence during adulthood.</Para><ItemizedList id="_1055" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>In a series of CNS malignancy survivors (n = 802) reported from the CCSS, adverse outcome in indicators of successful adult adaptation (educational attainment, income, employment, and marital status) were most likely in survivors who report neurocognitive dysfunction.<Reference refidx="4"/></ListItem><ListItem>Collectively, studies evaluating psychosocial outcomes among CNS tumor survivors indicate deficits in social competence that worsen over time.<Reference refidx="64"/></ListItem><ListItem>In a CCSS study that evaluated predictors of independent living status across diagnostic groups, adult survivors of childhood cancer with neurocognitive, psychological, or physical late effects were less likely to live independently as adults than were siblings in the control group.<Reference refidx="39"/></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_939">Childhood cancer survivors are also at risk of developing symptoms of psychological distress. In a longitudinal study of more than 4,500 survivors, subgroups of survivors were found to be at risk of developing persistent and increasing symptoms of anxiety and depression during a 16-year period. Survivors who reported pain and worsening health status were at the greatest risk of developing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and somatization over time.<Reference refidx="65"/> </Para><Para id="_1353">Adult survivors of childhood cancer are also at risk of suicide ideation compared with siblings, with survivors of CNS tumors being most likely to report thoughts of suicide. In a CCSS study that evaluated the prevalence of recurrent suicidal ideation among 9,128 adult long-term survivors of childhood cancer, survivors were more likely to report late suicidal ideation (odds ratio [OR], 51.9; 95% CI, 51.5–2.5) and recurrent suicidal ideation (OR, 52.6; 95% CI, 51.8–3.8) compared with siblings.<Reference refidx="66"/> History of seizure was associated with a twofold increased likelihood of suicide ideation in survivors.</Para><Para id="_940">The presence of chronic health conditions can also impact aspects of psychological health. In a study that evaluated psychological outcomes among long-term survivors treated with HSCT, 22% of survivors and 8% of sibling controls reported adverse outcomes. Somatic distress was the most prevalent condition and affected 15% of HSCT survivors, representing a threefold higher risk compared with siblings. HSCT survivors with severe or life-threatening health conditions and active chronic GVHD  had a twofold increased risk of somatic distress.<Reference refidx="67"/></Para><Para id="_599">Incorporation of psychological screening into clinical visits for childhood cancer survivors may be valuable; however, limiting such evaluations to those returning to long-term follow-up clinics may result in a biased subsample of survivors with more difficulties, and precise prevalence rates may be difficult to establish. A review of behavioral, emotional, and social adjustment among survivors of childhood brain tumors illustrates this point, with the prevalence of psychological maladjustment ranging from 25% to 93%.<Reference refidx="68"/> In a study of 101 adult cancer survivors of childhood cancer, psychological screening was performed during a routine annual evaluation at the survivorship clinic at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. On the Symptom Checklist 90 Revised, 32 subjects had a positive screen (indicating psychological distress), and 14 subjects reported at least one suicidal symptom. Risk factors for psychological distress included subjects’ dissatisfaction with physical appearance, poor physical health, and treatment with cranial irradiation. In this study, the instrument was shown to be feasible for use in the clinic visit setting because the psychological screening was completed in less than 30 minutes. In addition, completion of the instrument itself did not appear to cause distress in the survivors in 80% of cases.<Reference refidx="69"/> These data support  the feasibility and importance of consistent assessment of psychosocial distress in a medical clinic  setting. </Para><Para id="_1041">(Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062891" url="/about-cancer/coping/feelings/anxiety-distress-hp-pdq">Adjustment to Cancer: Anxiety and Distress</SummaryRef> for more information about psychological distress and cancer patients.)</Para><SummarySection id="_645"><Title>Post-traumatic stress after childhood cancer</Title><Para id="_646">Despite the many stresses associated with the diagnosis of cancer and its treatment, studies have generally shown low levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children with cancer, typically no higher than those in healthy comparison children.<Reference refidx="70"/> Patient and parent adaptive style are significant determinants of PTSD in the pediatric oncology setting.<Reference refidx="71"/><Reference refidx="72"/> </Para><Para id="_662">The prevalence of PTSD and post-traumatic stress symptoms has been reported in 15% to 20% of young adult survivors of childhood cancer, with estimates varying based on criteria used to define these conditions.<Reference refidx="73"/>  </Para><ItemizedList id="_1056" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Survivors with PTSD reported more psychological problems and negative beliefs about their illness and health status than did those without PTSD.<Reference refidx="74"/><Reference refidx="75"/></ListItem><ListItem>A subset of adult survivors (9%) from the CCSS reported functional impairment and/or clinical distress in addition to the set of symptoms consistent with a full diagnosis of PTSD.

Survivors who were treated with cranial irradiation before age 4 years were at particularly high risk for PTSD. Intensive treatment was also associated with increased risk of full PTSD.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_647">Because avoidance of places and persons associated with the cancer is part of PTSD, the syndrome may interfere with obtaining appropriate  health care.  Those with PTSD perceive greater current threats to their lives or the lives of their children.

Little is known about the specific impact of a cancer diagnosis with an onset in adolescence or the impact of childhood cancer on adolescent and young adult psychosocial outcomes.  The following studies describe psychosocial outcomes among these groups:</Para><ItemizedList id="_1057" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>In 820 adult survivors of cancer diagnosed during adolescence (between ages 15 and 18 years), when compared with an age-matched sample from the general population and a control group of adults without cancer, female survivors of adolescent cancers achieved fewer developmental milestones in their psychosexual development, such as having their first boyfriend, or reached these milestones later.  Male survivors were more likely to live with their parents than were same-sex controls. Adolescent cancer survivors were less likely to have ever married or have had children.  Survivors were significantly older at their first marriage and at the birth of their first child than were their age-matched samples.<Reference refidx="78"/> <Para id="_1058">Survivors in this cohort were also significantly less satisfied with their general and health-related life than were people in a community-based control group.  Impaired general and health-related life satisfaction were associated with somatic late effects, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and lower rates of posttraumatic growth.<Reference refidx="79"/></Para></ListItem><ListItem>In a survey of 4,054 adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors and 345,592 respondents who had no history of cancer, AYA cancer survivors were more likely to smoke (26% vs. 18%), be obese (31% vs. 27%), and have chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease (14% vs. 7%), hypertension (35% vs. 9%), asthma (15% vs. 8%), disability (36% vs. 18%), and poor mental health (20% vs. 10%). They were also less likely to receive medical care because of cost (24% vs. 15%).<Reference refidx="80"/></ListItem><ListItem>The CCSS evaluated outcomes of 2,979 adolescent survivors and 649 siblings of cancer survivors to determine the incidence of difficulty in six behavioral and social domains (depression/anxiety, being headstrong, attention deficit, peer conflict/social withdrawal, antisocial behaviors, and social competence).<Reference refidx="81"/> Survivors were 1.5 times (99% CI, 1.1–2.1) more likely than were siblings to have symptoms of depression/anxiety and 1.7 times (99% CI, 1.3–2.2) more likely than were siblings to have antisocial behaviors. Scores in the depression/anxiety, attention deficit, and antisocial domains were significantly elevated in adolescents treated for leukemia or CNS tumors, compared with the scores in siblings. In addition, survivors of neuroblastoma had difficulty in the depression/anxiety and antisocial domains. CNS-directed treatments (cranial radiation therapy and/or intrathecal methotrexate) were specific risk factors for adverse behavioral outcomes.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_1059">It should be noted that social withdrawal in adolescence was associated with adult obesity and physical inactivity.<Reference refidx="82"/> As a result, these psychological problems may increase future risk for chronic health conditions and support the need to routinely screen and treat psychological problems after cancer therapy. </Para><Para id="_651">Because of the challenges experienced by adolescents and young adults at cancer diagnosis and during long-term follow-up, this group needs to have access to programs to address the unique psychosocial, educational, and vocational issues that impact their transition to survivorship.<Reference refidx="83"/><Reference refidx="84"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><Para id="_435">Refer to the <Emphasis><ExternalRef xref="http://www.survivorshipguidelines.org/pdf/ltfuguidelines.pdf">Children's Oncology Group Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines for Survivors of Childhood, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancers</ExternalRef></Emphasis> for CNS and psychosocial late effects information, including risk factors, evaluation, and health counseling.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="17679663">Nathan PC, Patel SK, Dilley K, et al.: Guidelines for identification of, advocacy for, and intervention in neurocognitive problems in survivors of childhood cancer: a report from the Children's Oncology Group.

Again, these variable outcomes likely relate to the use of BMI as the metric for abnormal body composition, which does not adequately assess visceral adiposity that can contribute to metabolic risk in this population.<Reference refidx="110"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1301"><Title>Body composition alterations after treatment for CNS tumors</Title><Para id="_1302">Among brain tumor survivors treated with higher doses of cranial radiation therapy, only females treated at a younger age appear to be at increased risk for obesity.<Reference refidx="111"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1303"><Title>Body composition alterations after hematopoietic cell transplantation</Title><Para id="_1304">Survivors of childhood cancer treated with TBI in preparation for an allogeneic HSCT have increased measures of body fatness (percent fat) while often having a normal BMI.<Reference refidx="74"/><Reference refidx="112"/> Longitudinal decline in BMI related to substantial decrease in lean mass has been observed among survivors of hematological malignancies treated with allogeneic HSCT.
