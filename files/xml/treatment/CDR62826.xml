</KeyPoint><Para id="_14">Patients with cancer  are likely to have more than one <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045873">risk factor</GlossaryTermRef> for delirium. Identifying risk factors early may help prevent delirium or decrease the time it takes to treat it. Risk factors include the following:

</Para><ItemizedList id="_76" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Serious illness.</ListItem><ListItem>Having more than one disease.</ListItem><ListItem>Older age.</ListItem><ListItem><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462672">Dementia</GlossaryTermRef>.</ListItem><ListItem>Low level of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000616062">albumin</GlossaryTermRef> (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046092">protein</GlossaryTermRef>) in the blood, which is often caused by liver problems. </ListItem><ListItem>Infection.</ListItem><ListItem>High level  of nitrogen waste products in the blood, which is often caused by kidney problems.</ListItem><ListItem>Taking medicines that affect the mind or behavior.</ListItem><ListItem>Taking high <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044664">doses</GlossaryTermRef> of pain medicines, such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045054">opioids</GlossaryTermRef>.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_112">The risk increases when the patient has more than one risk factor.

Delirium can cause the patient to behave in unusual ways. Even a quiet or calm patient can have a sudden change in mood or become <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462659">agitated</GlossaryTermRef> and need more care. </Para><Para id="_120">Delirium can be upsetting to the family and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000648947">caregivers</GlossaryTermRef>. When the patient becomes agitated, family members often think the patient is in pain, but this may not be the case. Learning about differences between the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045022">symptoms</GlossaryTermRef> of delirium and pain may help the family and caregivers understand how much pain <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000482419">medicine</GlossaryTermRef> is needed. <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000650566">Health care providers</GlossaryTermRef> can help the family and caregivers learn about these differences.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_121"><KeyPoint id="_122">Delirium may affect physical health and communication.

</KeyPoint><Para id="_37">Early symptoms of delirium are like symptoms of depression and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462672">dementia</GlossaryTermRef>. Delirium that causes the patient to be inactive may appear to be depression. Delirium and dementia both cause problems with memory, thinking, and judgment. Dementia may be caused by a number of medical <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000651193">conditions</GlossaryTermRef>, including <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000476291">Alzheimer disease</GlossaryTermRef>. Differences in the symptoms of delirium and dementia include the following:

</Para><ItemizedList id="_79" Style="bullet"><ListItem>  Patients with delirium often show changes in how alert or aware they are.

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
