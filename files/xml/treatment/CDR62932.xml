The most common types of NSCLC are squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma, but there are several other types that occur less frequently, and all types can occur in unusual histologic variants.  Although NSCLCs are associated with cigarette smoke, adenocarcinomas may be found in patients who have never smoked. As a class, NSCLCs are relatively insensitive to chemotherapy and radiation therapy compared with SCLC. Patients with resectable disease may be cured by surgery or surgery followed by chemotherapy. Local control can be achieved with radiation therapy in a large number of patients with unresectable disease, but cure is seen only in a small number of patients. Patients with locally advanced unresectable disease may achieve long-term survival with radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy. Patients with advanced metastatic disease may achieve improved survival and palliation of symptoms with chemotherapy, targeted agents, and other supportive measures.</Para><SummarySection id="_12"><Title>Incidence and Mortality</Title><Para id="_27">Estimated new cases and deaths from lung cancer (NSCLC and SCLC combined) in the United States in 2014:<Reference refidx="1"/>                                                                                     </Para><ItemizedList id="_28" Style="bullet"><ListItem>New cases: 224,210.</ListItem><ListItem>Deaths: 159,260.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_29">Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States.<Reference refidx="1"/> The 5-year relative survival rate from 1995 to 2001 for patients with lung cancer was 15.7%.

The histological type of NSCLC  correlates with site of origin, reflecting the variation in respiratory tract epithelium of the bronchi to alveoli.  Squamous cell carcinoma usually starts near a central bronchus.

For smokers, the risk for lung cancer is on average tenfold higher than in lifetime nonsmokers (defined as a person who has smoked &lt;100 cigarettes in his or her lifetime). The risk increases with the quantity of cigarettes, duration of smoking, and starting age. </Para><Para id="_41">Smoking cessation results in a decrease in precancerous lesions and a reduction in the risk of developing lung cancer.

</Para><Para id="_516">Surgery is the  most potentially curative therapeutic option for this disease.  Postoperative chemotherapy may provide an additional benefit to patients with resected NSCLC.  Radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy can produce a cure in a small number of patients and can provide palliation in most patients.   Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) may reduce the incidence of brain metastases, but there is no evidence of a survival benefit and the effect of PCI on quality of life is not known.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> In patients with advanced-stage disease, chemotherapy or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors offer modest
improvements in median survival, though overall survival is poor.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> </Para><Para id="_517">Chemotherapy has produced short-term improvement in
disease-related symptoms in patients with advanced NSCLC.  Several clinical trials have attempted to assess the impact of chemotherapy on tumor-related symptoms and quality of life.  In total, these studies suggest that tumor-related symptoms may be controlled by chemotherapy without adversely affecting  overall quality of life;<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>  however,  the impact of chemotherapy on quality of life requires more
study.
 In general, medically fit elderly patients with good performance status obtain the same benefits from treatment as younger patients.    </Para><Para id="_484309">The identification of mutations in lung cancer has led to the development of molecularly targeted therapy to improve the survival of subsets of patients with metastatic disease.<Reference refidx="7"/> In particular, genetic abnormalities in <GeneName>EGFR</GeneName>, <GeneName>MAPK</GeneName>, <GeneName>PI3K</GeneName> signaling pathways in subsets of NSCLC may define mechanisms of drug sensitivity and primary or acquired resistance to kinase inhibitors. <GeneName>EGFR</GeneName> mutations strongly predict the improved response rate and progression-free survival of inhibitors of EGFR. Fusions of <GeneName>ALK</GeneName> with <GeneName>EML4</GeneName> genes form translocation products that occur in ranges from 3% to 7% in unselected NSCLC and are responsive to pharmacological inhibition of ALK by agents such as crizotinib. <GeneName>MET</GeneName> oncogene encodes hepatocyte growth factor receptor.
