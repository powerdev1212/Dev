defines <ExternalRef xref="http://www.iasp-pain.org/terms-p.html#Pain">pain</ExternalRef> as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage. Cancer pain can be managed effectively through relatively simple means in up to
90% of the eight million Americans who have cancer or a history of cancer. 
Unfortunately, pain associated with cancer is frequently undertreated.<Reference refidx="1"/>
</Para><Para id="_900">The highest prevalence of severe pain occurs in  adult patients with advanced cancer. Chronic pain is an issue in cancer patients, with up to 33% continuing to have pain after curative therapy.  During active cancer treatment and in advanced disease states, tumors cause most pain. However, survivors are affected more by pain related to modalities such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy than by cancer-related pain. One summary provides an excellent review of troublesome symptoms in cancer survivors, including pain.<Reference refidx="2"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663089">Level of evidence: IV</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_3">Although cancer pain or associated symptoms often cannot be entirely
eliminated, appropriate use of available therapies can effectively relieve pain
in most patients.  Pain management improves the patient’s
quality of life throughout all stages of the disease.
Patients with advanced cancer experience multiple concurrent symptoms with pain; therefore, optimal pain management necessitates a systematic symptom assessment and appropriate management for optimal quality of life.<Reference refidx="3"/> Despite the wide range of available pain management therapies, data are insufficient to guide their use in  children, adolescents, older adults, and special populations.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_4">State and local laws often restrict the medical use of opioids to relieve
cancer pain, and third-party payers may not reimburse for noninvasive pain-control treatments.  Thus, clinicians should work with regulators, state cancer
pain initiatives, or other groups to eliminate these health care system
barriers to effective pain management.  (These and other barriers to effective
pain management are listed below.)  Changes in health care delivery may create
additional disincentives for clinicians to practice effective pain management.

In a review of 1,612 patients referred to an outpatient palliative  care center where patients with advanced cancer were seen by both  a palliative care nurse and a physician, more than  half of patients with moderate to severe pain did not respond to an initial palliative care consultation, with response defined as a two-point or more reduction or a 30% or more reduction from baseline.  Also, one-third of patients with mild pain actually progressed to moderate to severe pain by the time of their first follow-up visit.  The authors concluded that more frequent follow-up visits, calls, and interdisciplinary clinics should be considered in an effort to optimize pain control.

Pain intensity and pain that interfered with walking ability, normal work, and relations with other people, as measured by the  Brief Pain Inventory (Greek version), were found to be significant predictors of anxiety, as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale on multivariate analysis.

</ItemizedList><Para id="_583">The experience of cancer pain is complex and includes physical, psychosocial, and spiritual dimensions.  There is no universally accepted pain classification measure that assists with predicting the complexity of pain management, particularly for cancer pain patients, who may be more difficult to treat.  Clinicians and researchers lack a common language to discuss and compare outcomes of cancer pain assessment and management.  Oncologists use the tumor, nodes, metastases (TNM) system as a universal language to describe a variety of cancers.  The need for a similar classification system for cancer pain resulted in the development of the Edmonton Staging System.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/>  This system has been further refined in two reports that have gathered construct validity evidence using an international panel of content experts <Reference refidx="13"/> and a multicenter study to determine interrater reliability and predictive value.<Reference refidx="14"/>  The development of an internationally recognized classification system for cancer pain could play a significant role in improving the assessment of cancer pain, allow a more meaningful assessment of clinical prognosis and treatment, and better enable researchers to compare results with regard to cancer pain management.<Reference refidx="15"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_47"><Title>Patient Self-report</Title><Para id="_48">The mainstay of pain assessment is the patient self-report;     however, family caregivers are often used as proxies for patient reports, especially in situations in which communication barriers exist, such as cognitive impairment or language difficulties. Family members who act as proxies typically, as a group, report higher levels of pain than patient self-reports, but there is individual variation.<Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] Differences in clinician assessment of pain intensity are also significant. A retrospective review of 41 patient charts using pain ratings of palliative care consultants as the gold standard found high agreement with assessments performed by bedside nurses (registered nurses [RNs] and clinical nurse assistants [CNAs]) when pain was not present or was mild but poor agreement for moderate or severe pain (sensitivity: RNs, 45%; CNAs, 30%).<Reference refidx="18"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663087">Level of evidence: III</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_617">Pain assessment tools may be unidimensional  or multidimensional.

Some patients may have EP without persistent pain.<Reference refidx="22"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663089">Level of evidence: IV</LOERef>] The prevalence of BP-EP varies widely, depending on which definition is used and based on the clinical scenario and cultural setting.  An appropriately designed,  cross-sectional, multicenter study that evaluated BP-EP in patients with chronic cancer-related pain was completed.<Reference refidx="23"/> The primary aim of the study was to assess the prevalence and characteristics of BP-EP on the basis of clinical assessment and through the use of a previously validated, culturally adapted tool, the  Questionnaire for Intense Episodic Pain (QUDEI-Italian), which utilizes a patient interview technique.  Physicians who participated in the study were trained to define and recognize BP-EP.   Patient evaluation and use of the questionnaire were carried out by different sets of providers. There was an estimated prevalence of 73% when a BP-EP diagnosis was made by physicians and 66% when the QUDEI was applied. When patients with baseline pain levels of 6 or lower (based on a numerical rating scale from 0 to 10) were analyzed, the physician prevalence decreased to 67%, versus 60% with tool utilization. The authors concluded that because of the frequent occurrence of BP-EP, a more widely accepted general definition of this phenomenon and specific validated tools to assist in education and screening are needed.<Reference refidx="23"/></ListItem></ItemizedList><ItemizedList id="_380" Style="bullet"><ListTitle>Location</ListTitle><ListItem>Ask the patient to indicate the exact location of the pain on his or her body,

pain therapy.  It is helpful to think of pain-related outcomes as primarily
measured in two ways: decreased pain intensity and improvement in psychosocial
functioning.  Using rating scales of pain intensity at its worst and on
average and using pain interference scales can help clinicians monitor
outcomes.  Measurement of the percentage of pain relief is also useful, though
measuring patient satisfaction is less useful because of the low expectations
patients sometimes hold for pain control.<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/></Para><Para id="_66">Drug-taking outcomes: Clinicians prescribing chronic opioids should also
monitor and document patients’ drug-taking behaviors.  Outcomes related to
addiction in cancer patients are rare but nonetheless should be periodically
assessed; these assessments can be reassuring to patients.  Tolerance and
dependence are not addiction related.  Documentation of patients’ compliance
with regard to changes in dosing and duration of prescriptions is essential in
all pain practice.
</Para><Para id="_67">The clinical assessment of drug-taking behaviors in medically ill patients with
pain is complex.  Aberrant drug-taking behavior from cancer pain management is
related to premorbid history of drug addiction and the likelihood of other pain
treatment.  A pilot questionnaire was used to characterize drug-related
behaviors and attitudes in cancer and AIDS patients.  Despite limitations, this
study highlights wide potential variation among different palliative care
populations in patterns of past and present aberrant drug-taking behaviors and
the need for a clinically useful screening approach.  The implications for
psychosocial and pharmacological management of symptoms such as pain, as well
as any aberrant behavior, remain unclear.<Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/></Para><Para id="_68">Previous drug abuse is likely to lead to specific needs for appropriate dosing

as a framework for pain management.<Reference refidx="1"/>  It involves a stepped approach based on
the severity of the pain.  If the pain is mild, one may begin by prescribing a
Step 1 analgesic such as acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drug (NSAID).  Potential adverse effects should be noted, particularly the
renal and gastrointestinal adverse effects of the NSAIDs.  If pain persists or
worsens despite appropriate dose increases, a change to a Step 2 or Step 3 analgesic
is indicated.  Most patients with cancer pain will require a Step 2
or Step 3 analgesic.  Step 1 can be skipped in favor of Step 2 or Step 3 in patients presenting at the
onset with moderate-to-severe pain.  At each step, an
adjuvant drug or modality such as radiation therapy may be considered in
selected patients.  WHO recommendations are based on worldwide availability of
drugs and not strictly on pharmacology.</Para><Para id="_72">Analgesics should be given “by mouth, by the clock, by the ladder, and for the
individual.”<Reference refidx="1"/>  This requires regular scheduling of the analgesic, not just as
needed.  In addition, rescue-doses for breakthrough pain need to be added.  The
oral route is preferred as long as a patient is able to swallow.  Each
analgesic regimen should be adjusted for the patient’s individual
circumstances and physical condition.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_73"><Title>Acetaminophen and Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs</Title><Para id="_74">NSAIDs are effective for relief of mild pain and may have an opioid
dose–sparing effect that helps reduce side effects when given with opioids for
moderate-to-severe pain.  Acetaminophen is included with aspirin and other
NSAIDs because it has similar analgesic potency, though it lacks peripheral
anti-inflammatory activity.<Reference refidx="2"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] Side effects can occur at any time, and patients
who take acetaminophen or NSAIDs, especially elderly patients, should be
followed up carefully.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>    There is growing debate  about whether  NSAIDs are useful  and have significant opioid-sparing effects.   One meta-analysis <Reference refidx="6"/> suggests that the usefulness of NSAIDs is limited and that they do not significantly spare opioid doses.   Another study suggests that NSAIDs are useful and reduce the need for opioid dose increases;  however, only patients with pain progression after 1 week of opioid stabilization were selected for the study.<Reference refidx="7"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] Patients taking NSAIDs are at risk for platelet

Direct comparisons between COX-2 inhibitors are few.  A systematic meta-analysis of COX-2 inhibitors compared with traditional NSAIDs or different COX-2 inhibitors for postoperative pain suggests that rofecoxib, 50 mg, and parecoxib, 40 mg, are equipotent to traditional NSAIDs for postoperative pain after minor and major surgical procedures and have a longer duration of action after dental surgery.  Rofecoxib was found to provide superior analgesic effect compared with celecoxib, 200 mg.  There were insufficient data to comment on toxicity.<Reference refidx="9"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_555">There are three coxibs that were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA): celecoxib, rofecoxib, and valdecoxib.

The question that remains unanswered is whether the increased risk applies to all COX-2 inhibitors, with the caution that  the burden of proof rests with those who might claim that this is a problem for rofecoxib alone and does not extend to other coxibs.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="10"/>  On April 7, 2005, valdecoxib was withdrawn from the market.  FDA is also asking manufacturers of all marketed prescription NSAIDs, including celecoxib (Celebrex), to revise the labeling (package insert) for their products to include a boxed warning, highlighting the potential for increased risk of cardiovascular events and/or the serious, potentially life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding associated with use of these drugs.</Para><ItemizedList id="_385" Style="bullet"><ListTitle>Dosage</ListTitle><ListItem>Use patient response to determine the effective dosing interval for aspirin,

pain, are effective, are easily titrated, and have a favorable benefit-to-risk
ratio.
</Para><Para id="_91">The predictable consequences of long-term opioid administration—tolerance and
physical dependence—are often confused with psychological dependence
(addiction) that manifests as drug abuse.  This misunderstanding can lead to
ineffective prescribing, administering, or dispensing of opioids for cancer
pain.  The result is undertreatment of pain.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_92">Clinicians may be reluctant to give high doses of opioids to patients with
advanced disease because of a fear of respiratory depression.  Many patients
with cancer pain become opioid tolerant during long-term opioid therapy.
Therefore, the clinician’s fear of shortening life by increasing opioid doses
is usually unfounded.</Para><SummarySection id="_93"><Title>Opioid types</Title><Para id="_94">Opioids are classified as full morphine-like agonists, partial agonists, or
mixed agonist-antagonists, depending on the specific receptors to which they
bind and their activity at these receptors.  The benefits of using opioids and
the risks associated with their use vary among individuals.  
</Para><Para id="_95">Morphine is the most commonly used opioid in cancer pain management, largely
for reasons of availability and familiarity;<Reference refidx="12"/>  however, it is useful to be
familiar with more than one type of opioid.  Wide interindividual variability
in response to both the analgesic and adverse effects of opioids is
recognized.<Reference refidx="13"/>  Some patients may not experience adequate pain control despite
appropriate dose adjustments, while others may develop intolerable adverse
effects to one particular opioid (see below).  Alternative opioids include
hydromorphone, oxycodone, oxymorphone, methadone, and fentanyl.  Knowledge of several medications and
formulations gives the caregiver much more flexibility in tailoring a regime to
a particular patient’s needs.
</Para><Para id="_96">Short-acting opioids are generally recommended when opioid therapy is being
initiated for the first time or when patients are medically unstable or the
pain intensity is highly variable.  Once stable, patients can be switched to a
controlled-release or slow-release formulation.  This is more convenient and
promotes compliance.

Methadone, however, can be considerably less expensive than existing rapid-release or sustained-release morphine or other opioid options.  A randomized trial of 103 patients compared the effectiveness and side effects of morphine and methadone as first-line treatments for cancer pain.  The outcome of successful pain management was similar for both groups; however, there were significantly more opioid-related dropouts in the methadone group.

An equianalgesic dose of methadone is first calculated, using an equianalgesic dose ratio of morphine to methadone of 10:1 (i.e., methadone is approximately ten times more potent than morphine). The caveat in using a ratio of 10:1 is that variations in ratios have been noted, depending on the dose of the previous opioid.

In this method, an opioid-naïve patient is started on 3  to 5 mg of methadone every 8 hours, and a nonnaïve patient is started on a dose of methadone that is equivalent to 50% of the estimated daily morphine dose. These doses are initially given for 3 days. Once the patient has acceptable pain relief for 6 to 8 hours, the dose is changed to a single fixed dose once a day and rescue doses are given as needed. This method is probably best suited for opioid-naïve patients (in relatively unlikely situations where more frequently used opioids such as morphine are not available) or patients who are, for one reason or another, being switched from relatively low doses of morphine or other opioids.

This method is suggested when patients are being switched from high  equivalent daily doses of morphine  (&gt;600 mg/d orally). The morphine or other opioid the patient is receiving is stopped.  Methadone at a dose of 5  to 10 mg orally is started every 4 hours and rescue doses of 5  to 10 mg every hour are allowed as needed. On the second to third days of the switch, the methadone dose is increased by up to 30% every 4 hours until sufficient pain relief is achieved and no significant adverse effects are noted. After exactly 72 hours following the switch to methadone, the dose is changed from every 4 hours to every 8 hours, and the interval of rescue doses is increased to every 3 hours as needed at the same single dose as established on days 2 to 3.

Adverse effects were uncommon.<Reference refidx="55"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] An as-needed rescue dose
(breakthrough dose) should be combined with the regular fixed-schedule opioid
to control the episodic exacerbation of pain, often referred to as breakthrough
pain.  When this pain is elicited by an action such as weight-bearing,
breathing, or defecation, it is termed incident pain.  Rescue or breakthrough
doses can be given hourly or more frequently as needed, depending on route of administration, pharmacokinetic properties of the drug, and presence or absence of side effects.  The breakthrough dose is generally

</Para><ItemizedList id="_397" Style="bullet"><ListTitle>Dosage
</ListTitle><ListItem>The appropriate dosing interval is determined by the opioid and formulation
used.  The analgesic effects of short-acting oral opioids such as morphine,
hydromorphone, codeine, and oxycodone begin within a half hour after
administration and  last for approximately 4 hours.  The dosing interval
of these drugs is usually 4 hours.  In patients given 
controlled-release formulations of morphine, hydromorphone, codeine, or
oxycodone, relief should begin in 1 hour, peak in 2 to 3 hours,  and last for 12
hours (controlled-release codeine is not available in the
United States); these formulations are usually prescribed in 12-hour intervals.  The analgesic effect of transdermal fentanyl begins approximately 12
hours after the application of the patch, peaks in 24 to 48 hours, and lasts
for approximately 72 hours.  Patches are therefore changed every  72 hours. 
In a  select group of patients who consistently experience end-of-dose failure despite increases in the patch doses, the dosing interval can be increased to every 48 hours (&lt;10% of patients on fentanyl patches). Transdermal fentanyl is not recommended for control of acute pain or poorly controlled pain because there is a delayed onset of action until reaching
steady-state either with new use or with a change in the dose. Patients receiving transdermal fentanyl may be switched to a continuous IV or subcutaneous infusion of fentanyl using a  conversion ratio of 1:1 to facilitate more rapid titration.<Reference refidx="59"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663087">Level of evidence: III</LOERef>]</ListItem></ItemizedList><ItemizedList id="_398" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListTitle>Dose titration</ListTitle><ListItem>To date, dose titration is largely patient-driven, as determined by the balance of analgesia with side effects.<Reference refidx="60"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]  For example, while morphine dose correlates with peak-and-trough plasma concentrations of a parent drug and its metabolites morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide, studies are conflicting with regard to the association between plasma levels of morphine and its metabolites versus analgesia as measured by pain scores.<Reference refidx="61"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] The strong opioid agonists have no maximum dose or ceiling dose.  The
appropriate dose is the amount of opioid that controls pain with the fewest
side effects.  Dose titration should continue until good pain relief is
achieved or intolerable side effects develop that cannot otherwise be
controlled.  The goal is to achieve a favorable balance between analgesia and
side effects through gradual adjustment of the dose.  If analgesic tolerance
appears to be occurring, the dose can be increased or consideration given to
switching the opioid, especially if higher doses are required.
<Para id="_127">The severity of the pain and the opioid formulation chosen determine the rate
of titration.  The dose of immediate-release formulations can be increased on a
daily basis if necessary until pain relief is adequate.  Among patients receiving relatively low doses of opioids, those with
uncontrolled moderate-intensity pain  require daily increases of between
25% and 50% to their previous dose, while patients with severe uncontrolled
pain may require a higher increase.    At higher
opioid doses, increases of 20% to 30% would be more prudent.  Rapid dose
escalation requires close monitoring for both efficacy and side
effects.
 Preliminary data suggest that titration with sustained-release daily morphine  is equivalent to titration with immediate-release morphine administered every  4 hours by an expert group of clinicians, but standard practice is to use a short-acting opioid for initial titration.<Reference refidx="62"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_128">Occasionally, doses may need to be reduced or, rarely, stopped.  This may
occur when patients become pain free as a result of cancer treatment, including
treatments such as nerve blocks and radiation therapy.  Another time to
consider reducing the dose is when a patient experiences significant 
opioid-related sedation that is accompanied by good pain control or when there is  metabolite retention in the context of developing and/or worsening renal failure.  In
situations where interventions achieve complete pain relief, rapid opioid
tapering rather than abrupt discontinuation is recommended to avoid opioid withdrawal symptoms.

The more common
adverse effects include nausea, somnolence, and constipation.  These should be
discussed with patients before starting opioids.  Somnolence and nausea are more often
encountered with initiation of opioid treatment but tend to resolve within a
few days.  Clinicians who follow patients during long-term opioid treatment
should watch for potential side effects and manage them as the need arises.</Para><SummarySection id="_410"><Title>Constipation</Title><Para id="_172">Anticipate the constipating effects of analgesics.  Opioids compromise
gastrointestinal tract peristaltic function (a nearly universal side effect). 
Consequently, stool within the gut lumen becomes excessively dehydrated.  The
cornerstones of effective prophylaxis, therefore, are measures aimed at
keeping the patient well hydrated to maintain well-hydrated stool. Unless there are existing alterations in bowel patterns, such as bowel obstruction or diarrhea, all patients using opioids should be started on a laxative bowel regimen and receive education for bowel management.  Patients who do not adequately respond to an aggressive regimen
with stool softeners may benefit from the addition of mild osmotic agents
(e.g., 70% sorbitol solution, lactulose, milk of magnesia), polyethylene glycol, bulk-forming laxatives (e.g., psyllium) with appropriate 
orally administered hydration, or mild cathartic laxatives (e.g.,  senna). Stimulant cathartics (e.g., senna, bisacodyl) may be useful in
severely constipated patients; however, they may be relatively ineffective in
situations in which stool has become desiccated.  Opioid-induced constipation is a
frequent cause of chronic nausea and is observed in 40% to 70% of patients
receiving opioids.<Reference refidx="64"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]  It appears to be dose-related, is characterized by large
variability in individuals, and is opioid-receptor mediated via both central and
peripheral mechanisms.  Opioids extend the gastrointestinal transit time and
desiccate the intraluminal content.<Reference refidx="126"/>  Unlike nausea, complete tolerance to
this effect does not generally develop, and most patients require
laxative/stool-softener therapy for as long as they take opioids.  A plain 
x-ray of the abdomen may be helpful in assessing the extent of fecal load.<Reference refidx="127"/> 
</Para><Para id="_173">Initiating a regular laxative
regimen emphasizes prevention of opioid-induced constipation.  Recommendations regarding laxative treatment have been
largely based on clinical experiences and observations.  Combinations of a
sennoside and a stool softener such as docusate are generally suggested.<Reference refidx="128"/> 
Reports that fentanyl causes less constipation than oral morphine are
interesting but need to be confirmed in further prospective studies.<Reference refidx="129"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663087">Level of evidence: III</LOERef>];<Reference refidx="63"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] 
One study demonstrated decreased laxative use in patients on transdermal
fentanyl as compared with patients receiving oral morphine treatment.<Reference refidx="63"/> One meta-analysis has revealed a significant difference in favor of transdermal fentanyl for constipation, although this included only three randomized controlled clinical trials.<Reference refidx="130"/> Whether this
decrease in laxative usage is clinically significant, however, and whether the decrease relates to the route of administration instead of the opioid
type need to be demonstrated.  In a single small series, opioid switching of
morphine to methadone resulted in a reduction in constipation.<Reference refidx="131"/>  Severe
opioid-induced constipation may occur.  At an extreme it may be present as a    
severe ileus and pseudo bowel obstruction.<Reference refidx="132"/>  As is the case with
opioid-induced nausea and constipation, management relies on the use of gastrointestinal
prokinetic agents.  The use of orally administered opioid-antagonists such as
naloxone is being studied.<Reference refidx="133"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>];<Reference refidx="134"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]  Although the oral bioavailability of these
medications is very limited, opioid withdrawal syndromes have been noted when
higher doses have been used. Methylnaltrexone, a quaternary derivative of naltrexone, is an opioid antagonist that does not cross the blood-brain barrier.    Preliminary studies suggest that it may be effective when given subcutaneously in the management of opioid-associated constipation without causing opioid withdrawal.<Reference refidx="135"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>];<Reference refidx="136"/><Reference refidx="137"/>   (Refer to the PDQ summaries on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062736" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/constipation/GI-complications-hp-pdq">Gastrointestinal Complications</SummaryRef>, <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062747" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/nausea/nausea-hp-pdq">Nausea and Vomiting</SummaryRef>, and <SummaryRef href="CDR0000276584" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/appetite-loss/nutrition-hp-pdq">Nutrition in Cancer Care</SummaryRef> for more

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_411"><Title>Nausea and vomiting</Title><Para id="_175">Nausea and vomiting (emesis) occur in approximately one-third to two-thirds of patients
taking opioids.<Reference refidx="138"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>];<Reference refidx="139"/><Reference refidx="140"/>  Nausea and vomiting are common complications of early exposure to
opioids and usually disappear within the first week of treatment.  Appropriate
antiemetic coverage during the opioid-initiation phase is usually effective in
limiting these adverse effects.  Nausea alone does not represent an allergic
reaction to the opioid.  Occasionally, nausea may be experienced when an
opioid dose is significantly increased.  An antiemetic should be available on
an as-needed basis to address this situation.
</Para><Para id="_176">Three main mechanisms underlie opioid-related nausea and vomiting.<Reference refidx="141"/>  The
predominant mechanism appears to be stimulation of the chemoreceptor trigger
zone, where dopamine is the main neurotransmitter.  Another mechanism is reduced
gastrointestinal motility, including delayed gastric emptying.  Nausea via
increased vestibular sensitivity is uncommon.
</Para><Para id="_177">Multiple antiemetic regimens have been proposed for the management of 
opioid-induced emesis, but prospective studies comparing one regimen over
another are lacking.<Reference refidx="141"/>  Metoclopramide or domperidone are generally
recommended as first-line agents because they improve gastrointestinal motility
and are antidopaminergic.<Reference refidx="141"/><Reference refidx="142"/>  Metoclopramide can be administered orally or
subcutaneously at doses of 10 mg 4 times a day or every 4 hours,
depending on the severity of the nausea.  Rescue doses should also be ordered
on an as-needed basis.  Extrapyramidal-related adverse effects are a potential
complication of these medications.  The incidence of extrapyramidal reactions
is low with domperidone, but this drug is not available in a parenteral
formulation.  The antihistamines act on the histamine receptors in the vomiting
center and on vestibular afferents.  They are generally reserved for cases
in which vestibular sensitivity, often manifesting as motion-induced nausea, is
suspected or for cases in which bowel obstruction precludes the use of gastrointestinal
prokinetic agents.  Haloperidol may also be used under the latter
circumstances.  The phenothiazines are an alternative group of antiemetics, but
extrapyramidal and anticholinergic adverse effects may be dose-limiting.
Chlorpromazine has modest antiemetic activity but a high incidence of sedation,
postural hypotension, and anticholinergic adverse effects, whereas piperazine   
derivatives such as prochlorperazine are stronger antiemetics but cause more
extrapyramidal side effects.  Anticholinergic side effects also limit the use
of anticholinergic agents such as hyoscine hydrobromide (scopolamine) in
opioid-induced nausea, particularly in patients with advanced cancer.  These
patients seem to be more vulnerable to these adverse effects.  The role of 
5-HT<Subscript>3</Subscript>-receptor antagonists such as ondansetron in ameliorating opioid-induced
nausea is not clear.<Reference refidx="143"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663087">Level of evidence: III</LOERef>]
</Para><Para id="_178">There appear to be differences between individual patients in the extent to
which different opioids cause nausea.<Reference refidx="144"/>  These differences form the basis for the
strategy of switching from one opioid to another when a particular opioid
produces persistent nausea.<Reference refidx="145"/><Reference refidx="146"/>  Switching the route, specifically from the
oral to the parenteral, has also been suggested, but the study supporting
this strategy is small.<Reference refidx="147"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]
</Para><Para id="_179">Nausea and vomiting can sometimes persist beyond the opioid-initiation phase or
occur de novo in patients on long-term opioid treatment.  Nausea and vomiting may become chronic
in nature.  The multicausal nature of the problem needs to be recognized because
management is directed at identifying and addressing the various causes.<Reference refidx="148"/> Constipation is a common contributing cause. 
Chronic nausea has been associated with the accumulation of active opioid
metabolites.<Reference refidx="93"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663087">Level of evidence: III</LOERef>]  A number of strategies are suggested to manage chronic nausea, including
switching the opioid or decreasing the dose when pain is well controlled.

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_412"><Title>Cognitive and other neurotoxic side effects of opioids</Title><Para id="_181">Opioid-related neurotoxicity may manifest as cognitive impairment,
hallucinations, delirium, generalized myoclonus, hyperalgesia and/or allodynia. 
Patients who have renal impairment or who are taking higher doses of opioids
are at greater risk of developing these side effects.  The mechanisms
underlying these side effects are unclear, but the opioid metabolites are implicated.  When patients present with generalized pain of an unknown source and the opioid dose has been recently increased, hyperalgesia should be considered as a possible diagnosis.<Reference refidx="149"/><Reference refidx="150"/> The
etiological contribution of opioids to cognitive impairment and delirium in the
cancer patient is often difficult to determine.  This is the case particularly
in patients with advanced disease in which the baseline vulnerability is
associated with multisystem impairment, and the concurrent administration of
other psychotropic agents can complicate the assessment of etiology. 
Nonetheless, opioid-induced cognitive problems have been reported.<Reference refidx="151"/><Reference refidx="152"/>  In addition to cognitive impairment within
the context of delirium, other effects include
myoclonus, hyperalgesia, perceptual disturbance, and seizures.<Reference refidx="153"/>  Although
the remarkable characteristics, potential severity, and impact of delirium
contribute to its dominance in the spectrum of opioid-related cognitive
dysfunction, more subtle psychomotor and cognitive opioid effects have been
described.  Neuropsychological testing has been used to study these more-subtle
effects in less-advanced cancer disease,<Reference refidx="154"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] chronic nonmalignant pain,<Reference refidx="138"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>];<Reference refidx="155"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]
and in healthy volunteers.<Reference refidx="156"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]  Collectively, studies of neuropsychological
testing have demonstrated somewhat mixed findings,<Reference refidx="157"/> with some detecting opioid-associated impairment in certain aspects of psychomotor or cognitive
function <Reference refidx="155"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] and others detecting minimal or no impairment.<Reference refidx="138"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>];<Reference refidx="154"/>
Clinical experience and some studies suggest that patients become tolerant of
the sedating effects that accompany either the initiation of opioid therapy or
dose increases,<Reference refidx="158"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] thereby allowing patients who are otherwise physically
able, and on stable opioid doses, to safely engage in activities such as
driving.<Reference refidx="154"/><Reference refidx="159"/>

underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of delirium.<Reference refidx="160"/><Reference refidx="161"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]  In the case of
meperidine, the anticholinergic activity associated with its active metabolite
normeperidine is suspected to be the basis of the cognitive impairment and
delirium occurring in association with this opioid.<Reference refidx="162"/><Reference refidx="163"/>  Other opioid
metabolites have been studied in relation to the generation of neuroexcitatory
states in animal laboratory models and delirium in human subjects.  A series of
animal studies have demonstrated neuroexcitatory states in association with
morphine metabolites, morphine-3-glucuronide (M-3-G) <Reference refidx="164"/> and 
normorphine-3-glucuronide,<Reference refidx="165"/> and the hydromorphone metabolite, 
hydromorphone-3-glucuronide.<Reference refidx="166"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]  In a hospice study of 36 patients with
advanced cancer receiving morphine, both M-3-G and morphine-6-glucuronide 
(M-6-G) levels were studied in relation to the development of side effects,
which included nausea and vomiting in 10 patients and cognitive impairment in 9
patients.<Reference refidx="167"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]  Creatinine levels, and plasma levels of M-3-G, M-6-G, and dose-corrected M-3-G and M-6-G, were higher in the 19 patients with side effects,
suggesting that the elevation of morphine metabolites in association with renal
impairment was associated with opioid toxicity, including cognitive impairment. 
Evidence is extensive demonstrating elevation of opioid-metabolite levels
in the setting of renal impairment,<Reference refidx="91"/><Reference refidx="98"/><Reference refidx="167"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>];<Reference refidx="168"/><Reference refidx="169"/> and some studies have noted
an association with features of neurotoxicity, including cognitive   
impairment.<Reference refidx="152"/><Reference refidx="167"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]  An accumulation of opioid metabolites possibly also occurs
during dehydration, which was suggested as a contributory factor in a
prospective study of predominantly opioid-related delirium.<Reference refidx="170"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]  Switching to
another opioid is one strategy for abating the side effects in cases in which
accumulation of active metabolites is considered responsible for side effects
such as generalized myoclonus, sedation, confusion, or chronic nausea.<Reference refidx="26"/>
</Para><SummarySection id="_413"><Title>Managing cognitive and other neurotoxic effects of opioids</Title><Para id="_184">The general management approach to opioid-induced delirium requires a

suggests that the presence of tactile hallucinations and myoclonus,<Reference refidx="84"/>
although not exclusively associated with opioid toxicity, raise the suspicion
of this cause.  A careful assessment can also identify prognostic factors
associated with greater difficulty in achieving pain control, the need for
higher opioid doses, and consequently greater risk of opioid-induced delirium. (Refer to the  PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062772" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/memory/delirium-hp-pdq">Delirium</SummaryRef> for more information.)

</Para><Para id="_185">In addition to searching for underlying reversible causes of delirium, the
symptomatic management of delirium requires the addition of a neuroleptic agent
to control agitation and perceptual or delusional disturbance.  Haloperidol is
regarded as the drug of choice in this context,<Reference refidx="173"/> and methotrimeprazine
and chlorpromazine are considered useful alternatives,<Reference refidx="174"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>];<Reference refidx="175"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663089">Level of evidence: IV</LOERef>] especially when
a greater level of sedation is required.  Midazolam, a sedating and short-acting benzodiazepine given by continuous infusion, is sometimes necessary,
especially in the case of nonreversible delirium.<Reference refidx="176"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663087">Level of evidence: III</LOERef>] Typical anxiolytics, including lorazepam, can be used to manage comorbid anxiety; however, they may contribute to the occurrence of delirium, so they should be used sparingly, if at all.  Early data suggest that some atypical antipsychotics may be beneficial in improving pain control and decreasing opioid requirements in the cancer patient with  mild cognitive impairment and/or anxiety.  It is unclear whether this benefit is due to a primary effect or to its secondary impact on cognitive impairment and/or anxiety.<Reference refidx="177"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_186">The specific management approach to opioid-induced cognitive and other

If the pain is well controlled, and the cognitive and neurotoxic side effects
are not severe, modest opioid dose reduction may be effective.  The rationale
for switching opioids, commonly referred to as opioid switching, is that a more
favorable balance between analgesia and side effects can be achieved, often
with a lower dose than that predicted by the conventional analgesic
table.<Reference refidx="85"/><Reference refidx="151"/><Reference refidx="179"/>  This can reflect incomplete cross-tolerance among opioids in
relation to analgesic and other effects.<Reference refidx="180"/>  It is also possible that

respiratory-depressant effects of these agents.  However, concerns about respiratory depression with opioid use remain prevalent among clinicians and patients.  Clinicians experienced in end-of-life care recognize that such concerns are generally exaggerated, though empirical research in the area is sparse.  One observational study of 30 patients that evaluated the effect of parenteral opioid titration for the control of acute exacerbation of cancer pain showed no association between parenteral opioid titration and hypoventilation at pain control, as measured by change in end-tidal CO<Subscript>2</Subscript> respiratory rate or oxygen saturation.<Reference refidx="188"/></Para><Para id="_645">When indicated for reversal of

manifest as slowly progressive (hours to days) somnolence and respiratory

considered, especially in the dying patient.  Generally, withholding one or two
doses of an opioid analgesic is adequate to assess whether mental and
respiratory depression are opioid related.  If symptoms resolve after temporary
opioid withdrawal, reduce the scheduled opioid dosage by 25%.  If symptoms do
not abate, but the patient complains of or exhibits signs of increased pain, or 
if symptoms referable to opioid withdrawal occur, consider alternative causes
for CNS depression and reinstate analgesic treatment.  Ongoing assessment is
essential to maintain adequate pain relief.

assessed for changes in libido and sexual dysfunction.  If these changes are
distressing to the patient, serum testosterone levels may be obtained.  Should
the patient seek improvement in libido and performance, treatment is often
empirical, keeping in mind that there are many potential causes of changes in
sexual function.  Treatment includes using nonopioids for pain, adding adjuvant
analgesics in the hope the opioid dose may be reduced, or replacing
testosterone through injections or a patch (if not contraindicated).  More
research is needed to understand the relationship between opioids and sexual
function, as well as the most effective treatment strategies. (Refer to the PDQ

Positive analgesic effects were observed and merit further study.<Reference refidx="274"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] Another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, graded-dose study was conducted in patients with advanced cancer who had opioid-refractory pain.<Reference refidx="275"/> Patients received either placebo or nabiximols (a cannabinoid formulation) intranasally; nabiximols consisted of 2.7 mg delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 2.5 mg cannabidiol (CBD) per 100-μL spray. Patients were randomly assigned to low-dose (2.7–10.8 mg THC and 2.5–10 mg CBD), medium-dose  (16.2–27 mg THC and 15–25 mg CBD), or high-dose (29.7–43.2 mg THC and 27.5–40 mg CBD) levels and were  assigned to placebo or active drug within each dose group. A total of 263 patients completed the study, which measured average pain, worst pain, sleep disturbance, and other quality-of-life issues.  There was no significant difference in the 30% responder rate, which was the primary analysis. However, in a continuous responder analysis evaluating average daily pain from baseline to end of study, there was a statistically significant greater analgesia for nabiximols (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .05) versus placebo overall, specifically in the low- and medium-dose groups. Only the  high-dose group compared unfavorably with placebo because of adverse events. The authors concluded that nabiximols may be a useful adjunct in treating opioid-refractory pain.<Reference refidx="275"/></ListItem></ItemizedList></ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_TrialSearch_69_sid_3"><Title>Current Clinical Trials</Title><Para id="_TrialSearch_69_13">Check NCI’s list of cancer clinical trials for U.S. supportive and palliative care trials about

Data from several prospective randomized trials have failed to show any increased rates of long-term toxicity with single-fraction palliative RT compared with multiple-fraction therapy.  In addition to pain control considerations, impact on the patient and caregiver related to the number of treatments delivered must be considered, with many patients finding increased convenience with single-fraction treatment. Another consideration is treatment cost, with single-dose fractionation regimens being less costly because of the smaller number of RT treatments delivered.</Para><Para id="_832">Stereotactic body RT (SBRT) is used to treat bone metastases by delivering large doses of RT in a highly conformal manner. Most commonly used to treat spinal metastatic disease, SBRT delivers large doses with a steep dose gradient, thereby potentially sparing adjacent neural structures. Most published data on SBRT have come from single-institution, retrospective studies. The complexities of target delineation, total dose, and fractionation have yet to be fully defined. SBRT may also be used when  re-treatment is required in previously irradiated areas.  Data  regarding RT dose or patient selection for the treatment of recurrent, painful spinal bony metastases with SBRT are not yet definitive.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_833">Pain flare, defined as an increase in pain after palliative RT,  can occur, although the incidence has not been well documented. A relatively small, prospective, randomized, controlled trial comparing 8 Gy in one fraction with 20 Gy in five fractions reported pain flare in 15 of 44 patients (34%) for a median duration of 3 days. The flare occurred in 10 of 23 patients (44%) in the 8-Gy group and in 5 of 21 patients (24%) in the 20-Gy group.<Reference refidx="11"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] A multicenter study included three outpatient clinics and 111 patients to determine the incidence of pain flare after palliative RT. Pain flare was defined in this study as an increase in pain severity before achieving pain relief as distinguished from progression of pain by requiring the worst pain score and analgesic intake return to baseline levels after the increase/flare. Most patients received 8 Gy in one fraction (64%) or 20 Gy in five fractions (25%). The overall pain flare incidence was 40% (39% with 8 Gy and 41% with multiple fractions).<Reference refidx="12"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_834">The use of RT with bisphosphonates has been evaluated in several prospective trials. The combination of zoledronic acid with either higher-dose palliative RT (30 Gy in ten fractions) or lower-dose RT (15 Gy in five fractions) for the treatment of single or multiple osteolytic or osteoblastic painful bony metastases in breast cancer patients was evaluated in a phase IV, randomized, controlled trial.<Reference refidx="13"/> Zoledronic acid, 4 mg, was given every 28 days starting with RT. There was no difference in analgesic or pain scores between the two regimens. However, it has not been shown that the combination of these agents with RT is superior to RT alone for pain relief. Additional prospective trials are needed.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_835"><Title>Radiopharmaceuticals</Title><Para id="_836">Radiopharmaceuticals are also utilized in the palliation of painful bony metastases. Single intravenous injections of beta-emitting agents such as iodine 131, phosphorus-32-orthophosphate, and strontium 89 and newer agents such as rhenium 186 and samarium 153 can relieve pain in widespread bony metastases.<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>];<Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/> Response rates range from 20% to 85%, depending on the agent used.</Para><Para id="_837">These agents have most commonly been used to treat osteoblastic metastases when there are several symptomatic sites and/or when the number of sites exceeds reasonable treatment with EBRT. Small-volume osteolytic metastases may respond to radiopharmaceuticals, but large-volume osteolytic disease usually does not respond.  In patients with inadequate pain relief, studies have demonstrated that approximately one-half of patients treated with radiopharmaceuticals respond to a second treatment. A prospective, multicenter, open-label trial of samarium suggested that multiple doses (i.e., more than two doses) may be administered to patients with advanced cancer and painful bone metastases with repeated benefit and adequate safety if there was an initial response to the initial samarium dose.<Reference refidx="18"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_838">Available data do not suggest that these radiopharmaceuticals eliminate the need for palliative EBRT.<Reference refidx="10"/> Limited studies compare the effectiveness of one radiopharmaceutical with another.

Through the use of electromagnetic energy, RFA induces thermal energy that damages tissue around the inserted electrode. The destruction of tissue depends on the temperature achieved and the duration of heating. With the use of image guidance, the goal of RFA is to maintain temperatures between 55°C and 100°C for 4 to 6 minutes to achieve cell kill. Because of slow thermal conduction through tissue, treatment time may increase up to 30 minutes. Preliminary results suggest that RFA may achieve palliation in patients with painful bony metastases.<Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/>;<Reference refidx="24"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663087">Level of evidence: III</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_841">In a nonconsecutive 27-month period, 43 patients underwent RFA. Of the 43 patients, 41 (95%) experienced a decrease in worst pain (at least 2 points on an 11-point scale) that continued for up to 24 hours. After peaking at week 1, the morphine-equivalent daily dose decreased significantly at weeks 8 and 12 before rising again at week 24. Three patients experienced adverse events that included a second-degree skin burn at the grounding pad site, transient bladder and bowel incontinence after treatment of a sacral lesion, and an acetabular fracture 6 weeks after RFA of a pelvic lesion.<Reference refidx="23"/> Other uncontrolled case reports confirm these findings.

Placement of an infusion catheter at a sympathetic ganglion extends the
sympathetic blockade from hours to days or weeks.  Destructive agents such as
ethanol or phenol can be used to effect neurolysis at sites identified by local

approach to pain management.  They help the patient obtain a sense of control
and develop coping skills to deal with the disease and its symptoms. 
Guidelines by a National Institutes of Health assessment panel  suggest
integration of pharmacologic and behavioral approaches for treatment of pain
and insomnia.<Reference refidx="24"/>
 Other studies suggest that behavioral interventions targeted to specific symptoms, such as pain and fatigue, can significantly reduce symptom burden and improve the quality of life for patients with cancer.<Reference refidx="25"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] Realistic expectations are needed for delivery of cognitive-behavioral interventions. One study <Reference refidx="26"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] of cognitive-behavioral interventions for  pain management randomly assigned 57 patients (most of whom were women with metastatic breast cancer who were maintained on daily opioid use for pain) to three 20-minute interventions delivered by audiotape (progressive muscle relaxation [PMR], positive mood induction, or a distraction condition) or to a no-intervention control. The patients were provided the audiotapes by a research nurse, given brief instructions, and asked to use the tapes at least five times a week for 2 weeks; more than half of the patients reported complying with these instructions. The relaxation condition and the “distraction” condition (self-selected informational tapes) produced significant immediate effects on pain, but the positive mood induction tapes showed no effects. The effects, however, neither carried over to general symptom management nor affected pain management at other times. One conclusion of this study is that ideally, interventions should be matched to patient preferences; for more extended effects, additional instruction and support may be needed, as suggested by other studies.</Para><Para id="_254">Interventions introduced early in the course of illness are more likely to
succeed because they can be learned and practiced by patients while they have
sufficient strength and energy.  Patients and their families should be given
information about and encouraged to try several strategies, and to select one or
more of these cognitive-behavioral techniques to use regularly:
</Para><ItemizedList id="_438" Style="bullet"><ListTitle>Relaxation and Imagery
</ListTitle><ListItem>Simple relaxation techniques (see examples listed below) should be used for
episodes of brief pain (e.g., during procedures).  Brief, simple techniques are
preferred when the patient’s ability to concentrate is compromised by severe
pain, a high level of anxiety, or fatigue.
</ListItem></ItemizedList><ItemizedList id="_439" Style="bullet"><ListTitle>Hypnosis
</ListTitle><ListItem>Hypnotic techniques may be used to induce relaxation and may be combined with
other cognitive-behavioral strategies.<Reference refidx="27"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]  Hypnosis is effective in relieving pain
in individuals who can concentrate well, can use imagery, and are motivated to
practice. A randomized but unblinded study of preoperative hypnosis in women undergoing excisional breast biopsy or lumpectomy revealed that women who underwent hypnosis required less propofol and lidocaine use during surgery and scored lower on measures of pain, nausea, fatigue, discomfort, and emotional upset at discharge.<Reference refidx="28"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]
</ListItem></ItemizedList><ItemizedList id="_440" Style="bullet"><ListTitle>Cognitive Distraction and Reframing
</ListTitle><ListItem>Focusing attention on stimuli other than pain or negative emotions accompanying
pain may involve distractions that are internal (e.g., counting, praying, or
making self-statements such as “I can cope”) or external (e.g., listening to music,
watching television, talking, listening to someone read, or using a visual focal
point).   In the related technique, cognitive reappraisal, patients learn to
monitor and evaluate negative thoughts and replace them with more positive
thoughts and images.
</ListItem></ItemizedList><ItemizedList id="_441" Style="bullet"><ListTitle>Patient/Family Education
</ListTitle><ListItem>Both oral and written information and instructions should be provided about
pain, pain assessment, and the use of drugs and other methods of pain
relief.<Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="31"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]  Patient education should emphasize that almost all pain can be
effectively managed.  Major barriers to effective pain management (refer to

Health care providers need to take into consideration family members’
interpretation of patient pain when providing pain management education
services, as some caregivers overestimate patient pain.<Reference refidx="32"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]  Educational intervention programs to help patients who have cancer and their families manage pain have been described and may improve clinical outcomes.<Reference refidx="33"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]  These programs are based on adult learning principles and  incorporate  key strategies, including provision of information using academic detailing, skill building with ongoing nurse-coaching, and interactive nursing support.<Reference refidx="34"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663089">Level of evidence: IV</LOERef>];<Reference refidx="35"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] Training partners to participate in management of cancer pain increases partner self-efficacy for controlling their loved one's pain and other symptoms.<Reference refidx="36"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</ListItem></ItemizedList><ItemizedList id="_442" Style="bullet"><ListTitle>Psychotherapy and Structured Support
</ListTitle><ListItem>Some patients benefit from short-term psychotherapy provided by trained
professionals.  Patients whose pain is particularly difficult to manage and who
develop symptoms of clinical depression or adjustment disorder should be
referred to a psychiatrist or psychologist for diagnosis.  The relationship between poorly controlled pain, depression, and thoughts of suicide should not be ignored.
</ListItem></ItemizedList><ItemizedList id="_443" Style="bullet"><ListTitle>Support Groups and Pastoral Counseling
</ListTitle><ListItem>Because many patients benefit from peer support groups, clinicians should be
aware of locally active groups and offer this information to patients and their
families.  Pastoral counseling members of the health care team should
participate in meetings to discuss patients’ needs and treatment.  They should
also be a source of information on community resources for spiritual care and social
support.

Clinical Manual for Nursing Practice. St. Louis, Mo: CV Mosby Co, 1989.]</ListTitle><ListItem>Exercise 1.  Slow Rhythmic Breathing for Relaxation<OrderedList id="_359" Style="Arabic" Compact="No"><ListItem>Breathe in slowly and deeply, keeping your stomach relaxed and your
shoulders relaxed.
</ListItem><ListItem>As you breathe out slowly, feel yourself beginning to relax; feel the   
tension leaving your body.
</ListItem><ListItem>Now breathe in and out slowly and regularly, at whatever rate is
comfortable for you.  Let the breath come all the way down to your stomach, as
it completely relaxes.
</ListItem><ListItem>To help you focus on your breathing and breathe slowly and rhythmically:   
(a) breathe in as you say silently to yourself, “in, two, three”; (b) breathe
out as you say silently to yourself, “out, two, three.” Or,
 each time you breathe out, say silently to yourself a word such as “peace” or
“relax.”</ListItem><ListItem>Do steps 1 through 4 only once or repeat steps 3 and 4 for up to 20
minutes.
</ListItem><ListItem>End with a slow deep breath.  As you breathe out say to yourself, “I feel   
alert and relaxed.”</ListItem></OrderedList></ListItem><ListItem>Exercise 2.  Simple Touch, Massage, or Warmth for Relaxation<OrderedList id="_360" Style="Arabic" Compact="No"><ListItem>Touch and massage are age-old methods of helping others relax.  Examples
include the following:
<ItemizedList id="_279" Style="dash"><ListItem>Brief touch or massage (e.g., handholding or briefly touching or rubbing a
person’s shoulder).
</ListItem><ListItem>Warm foot soak in a basin of warm water, or wrap the feet in a warm, wet
towel.
</ListItem><ListItem>Massage (3–10 minutes) may consist of whole body or be restricted to
back, feet, or hands.  If the patient is modest or cannot move or turn
easily in bed, consider massage of the hands and feet.
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList></ListItem><ListItem>Use a warm lubricant (e.g., a small bowl of hand lotion may be warmed
in the microwave oven, or a bottle of lotion may be warmed by placing
it in a sink of hot water for about 10 minutes).</ListItem><ListItem>Massage for relaxation is usually done with smooth, long, slow
strokes.  (Rapid strokes, circular movements, and squeezing of
tissues tend to stimulate circulation and increase arousal.) 
 However, try several degrees of pressure along with different types
of massage (e.g., kneading and stroking).  Determine which is preferred.
</ListItem><ListItem>Especially for the older person, a back rub that effectively produces
relaxation may consist of no more than 3 minutes of slow, rhythmic stroking
(about 60 strokes per minute) on both sides of the spinous process from the
crown of the head to the lower back.  Continuous hand contact is maintained by
starting one hand down the back as the other hand stops at the lower back and
is raised.  Set aside a regular time for the massage.  This gives the patient
something to look forward to and depend on.
</ListItem></OrderedList></ListItem><ListItem>Exercise 3.  Peaceful Past Experiences<Para id="_445">Something may have happened to you a while ago that brought you peace and
comfort.  You may be able to draw on that past experience to bring you peace or
comfort now.  Think about these questions:
</Para><OrderedList id="_362" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>Can you remember any situation, even when you were a child, when you felt   
calm, peaceful, secure, hopeful, or comfortable?
</ListItem><ListItem>Have you ever daydreamed about something peaceful?  What were you thinking
of?
</ListItem><ListItem>Do you get a dreamy feeling when you listen to music?  Do you have any
favorite music?
</ListItem><ListItem>Do you have any favorite poetry that you find uplifting or reassuring?</ListItem><ListItem>Have you ever been religiously active?  Do you have favorite readings,
hymns, or prayers?  Even if you haven’t heard or thought of them for many
years, childhood religious experiences may still be very soothing.
</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_446">Additional points: Some of the things you think of in answer to
these questions, such as your favorite music or a prayer, can probably be recorded for you.  Then you can listen to the tape whenever you wish.  If your
memory is strong, you may simply be able to close your eyes and recall the events or
words.</Para></ListItem><ListItem>Exercise 4.  Active Listening to Recorded Music<OrderedList id="_363" Style="Arabic" Compact="No"><ListItem>Obtain the following:<ItemizedList id="_297" Style="dash"><ListItem>A cassette player or tape recorder. (Small battery-operated machines
are more convenient.)
</ListItem>
<ListItem>Earphones or a headset. (This is a more compelling stimulus than a
speaker a few feet away, and it avoids disturbing others.)
</ListItem>
<ListItem>Cassette recording of music you like.  (Most people prefer fast, lively music,
but some people select relaxing music.  Other options are comedy routines,
sporting events, old radio shows, or stories.)
</ListItem>
</ItemizedList></ListItem><ListItem>Mark time to the music, e.g., tap out the rhythm with your finger or nod
your head.  This helps you concentrate on the music rather than your
discomfort.</ListItem><ListItem>Keep your eyes open and focus steadily on one stationary spot or object. 
 If you wish to close your eyes, picture something about the music.
</ListItem><ListItem>Listen to the music at a comfortable volume.  If the discomfort increases,
try increasing the volume; decrease the volume when the discomfort
decreases.
</ListItem><ListItem>If these steps are not effective enough, try adding or changing one or more of the
following: massage your body in rhythm to the music; try other music; mark
time to the music in more than one manner (e.g., tap your foot and finger at the same time).</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_306">Additional points: Many patients have found this technique to be helpful.  It
tends to be very popular, probably because the equipment is usually readily
available and is a part of daily life.  Other advantages are that it is easy to
learn and is not physically or mentally demanding.  If you are very tired, you
may simply listen to the music and omit marking time or focusing on a spot.

aggressive management of cancer pain.  Older patients are at risk for
undertreatment of pain, however, because of underestimation of their
sensitivity to pain, the expectation that they tolerate pain well, and
misconceptions about their ability to benefit from the use of opioids.  Issues
in assessing and treating cancer pain in older patients include:
</Para><ItemizedList id="_365" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Multiple chronic diseases and sources of pain.<Para id="_340">Age and complex medication regimens place them at increased risk for drug-drug
and drug-disease interactions.
</Para></ListItem><ListItem>Visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive impairments.<Para id="_342">The use of simple descriptive, numeric, and visual-analog pain-assessment
instruments may be impeded.  Cognitively impaired patients may require simpler
scales and more frequent pain assessment.
</Para></ListItem><ListItem>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) side effects.<Para id="_344">Although effective alone or as adjuncts to opioids, NSAIDs are more likely to
cause gastric and renal toxicity and other drug reactions such as cognitive
impairment, constipation, and headaches in older patients.  Alternative NSAIDs
(e.g., choline magnesium trisalicylate) or coadministration of misoprostol
with NSAIDs should be considered to reduce gastric toxicity.</Para></ListItem><ListItem>Opioid effectiveness.<Para id="_346">Older persons tend to be more sensitive to the analgesic and central nervous system depressant
effects of opioids.  Peak opioid effects are generally greater and the duration
of pain relief may be longer.
</Para></ListItem>    <ListItem>Patient-controlled analgesia.<Para id="_348">Slower drug clearance and increased sensitivity to undesirable drug effects
(e.g., cognitive impairment) indicate the need for cautious initial dosing and
subsequent titration and monitoring of continuous parenteral infusions.
