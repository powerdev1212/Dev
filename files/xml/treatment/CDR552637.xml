There are more than 100 types of tumors that are clinically apparent on the skin;  many of these are known to have <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460148">familial</GlossaryTermRef> components, either in isolation or as part of a syndrome with other features. This is, in part,  because the skin itself is a complex organ made up of multiple cell types.  Furthermore, many of these cell types can undergo malignant transformation at various points in their differentiation, leading to tumors with distinct histology and dramatically different biological behaviors, such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell cancer (BCC).  These have been called nonmelanoma skin cancers or keratinocytic cancers.</Para><Para id="_83">Figure 1 is a simple diagram of normal skin structure.  It also indicates the major cell types that are normally found in each compartment. Broadly speaking, there are two large compartments—the avascular cellular epidermis and the vascular dermis—with many cell types distributed in a largely acellular matrix.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><MediaLink ref="CDR0000624959" type="image/jpeg" alt="Schematic representation of normal skin; drawing shows normal skin anatomy, including the epidermis, dermis, hair follicles, sweat glands, hair shafts, veins, arteries, fatty tissue, nerves, lymph vessels, oil glands, and subcutaneous tissue. The pullout shows a close-up of the squamous cell and basal cell layers of the epidermis, the basement membrane in between the epidermis and dermis, and the dermis with blood vessels.

Schematic representation of normal skin.  The relatively avascular epidermis houses basal cell keratinocytes and squamous epithelial keratinocytes, the source cells for BCC and SCC, respectively.  Melanocytes are also present in normal skin and serve as the source cell for melanoma.   The separation between epidermis and dermis occurs at the basement membrane zone, located just inferior to the basal cell keratinocytes.</Caption></MediaLink><Para id="_84">The outer layer or epidermis is made primarily of keratinocytes but has several other minor cell populations. The bottom layer is formed of basal keratinocytes abutting the basement membrane. The basement membrane is formed from products of keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts, such as collagen and laminin, and is an important anatomical and functional structure. As the basal keratinocytes divide and differentiate, they lose contact with the basement membrane and form the spinous cell layer, the granular cell layer, and the keratinized outer layer or stratum corneum.   </Para><Para id="_232">The true cytologic origin of BCC remains in question.   BCC and basal cell keratinocytes share many histologic similarities, as is reflected in the name. Alternatively, the outer root sheath cells of the hair follicle have also been proposed as the cell of origin for BCC.<Reference refidx="2"/> This is suggested by the fact that BCCs occur predominantly on hair-bearing skin. BCCs rarely metastasize but can invade tissue locally or regionally, sometimes following along nerves. A tendency for superficial necrosis has resulted in the name "rodent ulcer."<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_233">Some debate remains about the origin of SCC; however, these cancers are likely derived from epidermal stem cells associated with the hair follicle.<Reference refidx="4"/> A variety of tissues, such as lung and uterine cervix,  can give rise to SCC, and this cancer has somewhat differing behavior depending on its source. Even in cancer derived from the skin, SCC from different anatomic locations can have moderately differing aggressiveness; for example, SCC from glabrous (smooth, hairless) skin has a lower metastatic rate than SCC arising from the vermillion border of the lip or from scars.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_85">Additionally, in the epidermal compartment, melanocytes distribute singly along the basement membrane and can transform into melanoma.  Melanocytes are derived from neural crest cells and migrate to the epidermal compartment near the eighth week of gestational age. Langerhans cells, or dendritic cells, are a  third cell type in the epidermis and have a primary function of antigen presentation. These cells reside in the skin for an extended time and respond to different stimuli, such as ultraviolet radiation or topical steroids, which cause them to migrate out of the skin.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_86">The dermis is largely composed of an extracellular matrix.  Prominent cell types in this compartment are fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and transient immune system cells.  When transformed, fibroblasts form fibrosarcomas and endothelial cells form angiosarcomas, Kaposi sarcoma, and other vascular tumors. There are a number of immune cell types that move in and out of the skin to blood vessels and lymphatics; these include mast cells, lymphocytes, mononuclear cells, histiocytes, and granulocytes. These cells can increase in number in inflammatory diseases and can form tumors within the skin.  For example, urticaria pigmentosa is a condition that arises from mast cells and is occasionally associated with mast cell leukemia; cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is often confined to the skin throughout its course. Overall, 10% of leukemias and lymphomas have prominent expression in the skin.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_87">Epidermal appendages are also found in the dermal compartment. These are derivatives of the epidermal keratinocytes, such as hair follicles, sweat glands, and the sebaceous glands associated with the hair follicles.  These structures are generally formed in the first and second trimesters of fetal development. These  can form a large variety of benign or malignant tumors with diverse biological behaviors.  Several of these tumors are associated with familial syndromes.  Overall, there are dozens of different histological subtypes of these tumors associated with individual components of the adnexal structures.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_88">Finally, the subcutis is a layer that extends below the dermis with varying depth, depending on the anatomic location. This deeper boundary can include muscle, fascia, bone, or cartilage. The subcutis can be affected by inflammatory conditions such as panniculitis and malignancies such as liposarcoma.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_89">These compartments give rise to their own malignancies but are also the region of immediate adjacent spread of localized skin cancers from other compartments. The boundaries of each skin compartment are used to define the staging of skin cancers. For example, an <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> melanoma is confined to the epidermis. Once the cancer  crosses the basement membrane into the dermis, it is invasive. Internal malignancies also commonly metastasize to the skin. The dermis and subcutis are the most common locations, but the epidermis can also be involved in conditions such as Pagetoid breast cancer.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_90"><Title>Function of the Skin</Title><Para id="_91">The skin has a wide variety of functions.  First, the skin is an important barrier preventing extensive water and temperature loss and providing protection against minor abrasions.  These functions can be aberrantly regulated in cancer. For example, in the erythroderma associated with advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, alterations in the regulations of body temperature can result in profound heat loss. Second, the skin has important adaptive and innate immunity functions. In adaptive immunity, antigen-presenting cells engender a TH1, TH2, and TH17 response.<Reference refidx="9"/> In innate immunity, the immune system produces numerous peptides with antibacterial and antifungal capacity.  Consequently, even small breaks in the skin can lead to infection. The skin-associated lymphoid tissue  is one of the largest arms of the immune system. It may also be important in immune surveillance against cancer. Immunosuppression, which occurs during organ transplant, is a significant risk factor for skin cancer. The skin is  significant for communication through facial expression and hand movements. Unfortunately, areas of specialized function, such as the area around the eyes and ears, are common places for cancer to occur.  Even small cancers in these areas can lead to reconstructive challenges and have significant cosmetic and social ramifications.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_680"><Title>Clinical Presentation of Skin Cancers</Title><Para id="_636">While the appearance of any one skin cancer can vary, there are general  physical presentations that  can be used in screening. BCCs most commonly have a pearly rim (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000552637#_854" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-genetics-pdq">Figure 3</SummaryRef>) or can appear somewhat eczematous. They often ulcerate (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000552637#_854" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-genetics-pdq">Figure 3</SummaryRef>). SCCs frequently have a thick keratin top layer (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000552637#_850" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-genetics-pdq">Figure 4</SummaryRef>). Both BCCs and SCCs are associated with a history of sun-damaged skin. Melanomas are characterized by asymmetry, border irregularity, color variation, a diameter of more than 6 mm, and evolution (ABCDE criteria). (Refer to <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/prevention/skin/melanomaphotos">What Does Melanoma Look Like?</ExternalRef> on  NCI's Web site for more information about the ABCDE criteria.)

 (such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000302456">family history</GlossaryTermRef>, skin type, and genetic syndromes) also potentially contribute to carcinogenesis.   In contrast to melanoma, metastatic spread of BCC is very rare and typically arises from large tumors that have evaded medical treatment for extended periods of time.  BCCs can invade tissue locally or regionally, sometimes following along nerves. A tendency for superficial necrosis has resulted in the name "rodent ulcer." With early detection, the prognosis for BCC is excellent.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_279"><Title>Risk Factors for Basal Cell Carcinoma</Title><SummarySection id="_324"><Title>Sun exposure</Title><Para id="_325">Sun exposure is the major known environmental factor associated with the development of skin cancer of all types.  There are different patterns of sun exposure associated with each major type of skin cancer  (BCC, squamous cell carcinoma [SCC], and melanoma).</Para><Para id="_326">While there is no standard measure, sun exposure can be generally classified as intermittent or chronic, and the effects may be considered acute or cumulative.  Intermittent sun exposure is obtained sporadically, usually during recreational activities, and particularly by indoor workers who have only weekends or vacations to be outdoors and whose skin has not adapted to the sun. Chronic sun exposure is incurred by consistent, repetitive sun exposure, during outdoor work or recreation. Acute sun exposure is obtained over a short time period on skin that has not adapted to the sun. Depending on the time of day and a person's  skin type, acute sun exposure may result in sunburn. In epidemiology studies, sunburn is usually defined as burn with pain and/or blistering that lasts for 2 or more days. Cumulative sun exposure is the additive amount of sun exposure that one receives over a lifetime.  Cumulative sun exposure may reflect the additive effects of intermittent sun exposure, chronic sun exposure, or both.</Para><Para id="_327">Specific patterns of sun exposure appear to lead to different types of skin cancer among susceptible individuals. Intense intermittent recreational sun exposure has been associated with melanoma and BCC,<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>  while chronic occupational sun exposure has been associated with SCC.  Given these data, dermatologists routinely counsel patients to protect their skin from the sun by avoiding mid-day sun exposure, seeking shade, and wearing sun-protective clothing, although evidence-based data for these practices are lacking.  The data regarding skin cancer risk reduction by regular sunscreen use are variable. One randomized trial of sunscreen efficacy demonstrated statistically significant protection for the development of SCC but no protection for BCC,<Reference refidx="4"/> while another randomized study demonstrated a  trend for reduction in multiple occurrences of BCC among sunscreen users <Reference refidx="5"/> but no significant reduction in BCC or SCC incidence.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_727"><LOERef href="CDR0000531818">Level of evidence (sun-protective clothing, avoidance of sun exposure): 4aii</LOERef>

Petroleum byproducts (e.g., asphalt, tar, soot, paraffin, and pitch), organophosphate compounds, and arsenic are all occupational exposures associated with cutaneous nonmelanoma cancers.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_349">Arsenic exposure may occur through contact with contaminated food, water, or air. While arsenic is ubiquitous in the environment, its ambient concentration in both food and water may be increased near smelting, mining, or coal-burning establishments.    Arsenic levels in the U.S. municipal water supply are tightly regulated; however, control is lacking for potable water obtained through private wells.  As it percolates through rock formations with naturally occurring arsenic, well water may acquire hazardous concentrations of this material.   In many parts of the world, wells providing drinking water are contaminated by high levels of arsenic in the ground water. The populations in Bangladesh, Taiwan, and many other locations have  high levels of skin cancer associated with elevated levels of arsenic in the drinking water.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/> Medicinal arsenical solutions (e.g., Fowler’s solution and Bell’s asthma medication) were once used to treat common chronic conditions such as psoriasis, syphilis, and asthma, resulting in associated late-onset cutaneous malignancies.<Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/>  Current potential iatrogenic sources of arsenic exposure include poorly regulated Chinese traditional/herbal medications and intravenous arsenic trioxide utilized to induce remission in acute promyelocytic leukemia.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/></Para><Para id="_350">Aerosolized particulate matter produced by combustion of arsenic-containing materials is another source of environmental exposure.  Arsenic-rich coal, animal dung from arsenic-rich regions, and chromated copper arsenate–treated wood produce airborne arsenical particles when burned.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/>  Burning of these products in enclosed unventilated settings (such as for heat generation) is particularly hazardous.<Reference refidx="24"/></Para><Para id="_647">Clinically, arsenic-induced skin cancers are characterized by multiple recurring SCCs and BCCs occurring in areas of the skin that are usually protected from the sun. A range of cutaneous findings are associated with chronic or severe arsenic exposure, including pigmentary variation (poikiloderma of the skin) and Bowen disease (SCC <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis>).<Reference refidx="25"/></Para><Para id="_864">However, the effect of arsenic on skin cancer risk may be more complex than previously thought.  Evidence from <Emphasis>in vivo</Emphasis> models indicate that arsenic, alone or in combination with itraconazole, can inhibit the hedgehog pathway in cells with wild-type or mutated <GeneName>Smoothened</GeneName>  by binding to GLI2 proteins; in this way, these drugs demonstrated inhibition of BCC growth in these animal models.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/>    Additionally, the effect of arsenic on skin cancer risk may be modified by certain variants in nucleotide excision repair genes (xeroderma pigmentosum [XP] types A and D).<Reference refidx="28"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_367"><Title>Pigmentary characteristics</Title><Para id="_368">The high-risk <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460203">phenotype</GlossaryTermRef> consists of individuals with the following physical characteristics:</Para><ItemizedList id="_373" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Fair skin that sunburns easily.</ListItem><ListItem>Lightly pigmented irides (blue and green).</ListItem><ListItem>Presence of freckles in sun-exposed sites.</ListItem><ListItem>Poor ability to tan.</ListItem><ListItem>Blond or red hair color.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_374">Specifically, people with more highly pigmented skin demonstrate lower incidence of BCC than do people with lighter pigmented skin.

As the duration and dosage of immunosuppressive agents increases, so does the risk of cutaneous malignancy; this effect is reversed with decreasing the dosage of, or taking a break from, immunosuppressive agents.  Heart transplant recipients, requiring the highest rates of immunosuppression, are at much higher risk of cutaneous malignancy than liver transplant recipients, in whom much lower levels of immunosuppression are needed to avoid rejection.<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="36"/>  The risk appears to be highest in geographic areas of high UV radiation exposure: when comparing Australian and Dutch organ transplant populations, the Australian patients carried a fourfold increased risk of developing SCC and a fivefold increased risk of developing BCC.<Reference refidx="37"/>  This speaks to the importance of rigorous sun avoidance among high-risk immunosuppressed individuals.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_333"><Title>Family history</Title><Para id="_334">Individuals with BCCs and/or SCCs report a higher frequency of these cancers in their family members than do controls.

Scheduling activities outside of the peak hours of UV radiation, utilizing sun-protective clothing and hats, using sunscreen liberally, and strictly avoiding tanning beds are all reasonable steps towards minimizing future risk of skin cancer.  For patients with particular <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000256553">genetic susceptibility</GlossaryTermRef> (such as BCNS), avoidance or minimization of ionizing radiation is essential to reducing future tumor burden.</Para><Para id="_817"><LOERef href="CDR0000531812">Level of evidence: 2aii</LOERef></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_271"><Title>Chemoprevention</Title><Para id="_272">The role of various systemic retinoids, including isotretinoin and acitretin, has been explored in the chemoprevention and treatment of multiple BCCs, particularly in BCNS patients.  In one study of isotretinoin use in 12 patients with multiple BCCs, including 5 patients with BCNS, tumor regression was noted, with decreasing efficacy as the tumor diameter increased.<Reference refidx="156"/>   However, the results were insufficient to recommend use of systemic retinoids for treatment of BCC.  Three additional patients, including one with BCNS, were followed long-term for evaluation of chemoprevention with isotretinoin, demonstrating significant decrease in the number of tumors per year during treatment.<Reference refidx="156"/>   Although the rate of tumor development tends to increase sharply upon discontinuation of systemic retinoid therapy, in some patients the rate remains lower than their pretreatment rate, allowing better management and control of their cutaneous malignancies.<Reference refidx="156"/><Reference refidx="157"/><Reference refidx="158"/>  In summary, the use of systemic retinoids for chemoprevention of BCC is reasonable in high-risk patients, including patients with XP, as discussed in the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000552637#_253" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-genetics-pdq">Squamous Cell Carcinoma</SummaryRef> section of this summary.</Para><Para id="_274">A patient’s cumulative and evolving tumor load should be evaluated carefully in light of the potential long-term use of a medication class with cumulative and idiosyncratic side effects.  Given the possible side-effect profile, systemic retinoid use is best managed by a practitioner with particular expertise and comfort with the medication class.  However, for all potentially childbearing women, strict avoidance of pregnancy during the systemic retinoid course—and for 1 month after completion of isotretinoin and 3 years after completion of acitretin—is essential to avoid potentially fatal and devastating fetal malformations.</Para><Para id="_818"><LOERef href="CDR0000531812">Level of evidence (retinoids): 2aii</LOERef></Para><Para id="_701">In a phase II study of 41 patients with BCNS, vismodegib (an inhibitor of the hedgehog pathway) has been shown to reduce the per-patient annual rate of new BCCs requiring surgery.<Reference refidx="159"/>  Existing BCCs also regressed for these patients during daily treatment with 150 mg of oral vismodegib.  While patients treated had visible regression of their tumors, biopsy demonstrated residual microscopic malignancies at the site, and tumors progressed after the discontinuation of the therapy. Adverse effects included  taste disturbance, muscle cramps, hair loss, and weight loss and led to discontinuation of the medication in 54% of subjects.  Based on the side-effect profile and rate of disease recurrence after discontinuation of the medication, additional study regarding optimal dosing of vismodegib is ongoing.</Para><Para id="_702"><LOERef href="CDR0000526277">Level of evidence (vismodegib): 1aii</LOERef></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_466"><Title>Treatment</Title><Para id="_467">Treatment of individual basal cell cancers in BCNS is generally the same as for sporadic basal cell cancers.

Although most cancer registries do not include information on the incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer, annual incidence estimates range from 1 million to 3.5 million cases in the United States.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_416"> Mortality is rare from this cancer; however, the morbidity and costs associated with its treatment are considerable.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_284"><Title>Risk Factors for Squamous Cell Carcinoma</Title><SummarySection id="_337"><Title>Sun exposure</Title><Para id="_338">Sun exposure is the major known environmental factor associated with the development of skin cancer of all types; however, different patterns of sun exposure are associated with each major type of skin cancer.  (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000552637#_324" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-genetics-pdq">Sun exposure</SummaryRef> section in the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000552637#_9" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-genetics-pdq">Basal Cell Carcinoma</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information.) This section focuses on sun exposure and increased risk of cutaneous SCC.   </Para><Para id="_375">Unlike basal cell carcinoma (BCC), SCC is associated with chronic exposure, rather than intermittent intense exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation.  Occupational exposure is the characteristic pattern of sun exposure linked with SCC.<Reference refidx="3"/> A case-control study in southern Europe showed increased risk of SCC when lifetime sun exposure exceeded 70,000 hours.  People whose lifetime sun exposure equaled or exceeded 200,000 hours had an odds ratio (OR) 8 to 9 times that of the reference group.<Reference refidx="4"/>  A Canadian case-control study did not find an association between cumulative lifetime sun exposure and SCC; however, sun exposure in the 10 years before diagnosis and occupational exposure were found to be risk factors.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_376"><Title>Other radiation exposure</Title><Para id="_377">In addition to environmental radiation, exposure to therapeutic radiation is another risk factor for SCC.  Individuals with skin disorders treated with psoralen and ultraviolet-A radiation (PUVA) had a threefold to sixfold increase in SCC.<Reference refidx="6"/> This effect appears to be dose-dependent, as only 7% of individuals who underwent fewer than 200 treatments had SCC, compared  with more than 50% of those who underwent more than 400 treatments.<Reference refidx="7"/>  Therapeutic use of ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation has also been shown to cause a mild increase in SCC (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.37).<Reference refidx="8"/>  
Devices such as tanning beds also emit UV radiation and have been associated with increased SCC risk, with a reported OR of 2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7–3.8).<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_417">Investigation into the effect of ionizing radiation on SCC carcinogenesis has yielded conflicting results.  One population-based case-control study found that patients who had undergone therapeutic radiation had an increased risk of SCC at the site of previous radiation (OR, 2.94) as compared with individuals who had not undergone radiation treatments.<Reference refidx="10"/>  Cohort studies of radiology technicians, atomic-bomb survivors, and survivors of childhood cancers have not shown an increased risk of SCC, although the incidence of BCC was increased in all of these populations.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/> For those who develop SCC at previously radiated sites that are not sun-exposed, the latent period appears to be quite long; these cancers may be diagnosed years or even decades after the radiation exposure.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para><Para id="_379">The effect of other types of radiation, such as cosmic radiation, is also controversial.  Pilots and flight attendants have a reported incidence of SCC that ranges between 2.1      and      9.9 times what would be expected; however, the overall cancer incidence is not consistently elevated.

Like BCCs, SCCs appear to be associated with exposure to arsenic in drinking water and combustion products.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/>  However, this association may hold true only for the highest levels of arsenic exposure.  Individuals who had toenail concentrations of arsenic above the 97th percentile were found to have an approximately twofold increase in SCC risk.<Reference refidx="23"/> For arsenic, the latency period can be lengthy; invasive SCC has been found to develop at an average of 20 years after exposure.<Reference refidx="24"/></Para><Para id="_382">Current or previous cigarette smoking has been associated with a 1.5-fold to 2-fold increase in SCC risk,<Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/> although one large study showed no change in risk.<Reference refidx="28"/>  Available evidence suggests that the effect of smoking on cancer risk seems to be greater for SCC than for BCC.</Para><Para id="_383">Additional reports have suggested weak associations between SCC and exposure to insecticides, herbicides, or fungicides.<Reference refidx="29"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_384"><Title>Characteristics of the skin</Title><Para id="_385">Like melanoma and BCC, SCC occurs more frequently in individuals with lighter skin  than in those with darker skin.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="30"/>  However, SCC can also occur in individuals with darker skin. An Asian registry based in Singapore reported an increase in skin cancer in that geographic area, with an incidence rate of 8.9 per 100,000 person-years.  Incidence of SCC, however, was shown to be on the decline.<Reference refidx="30"/>  SCC is the most common form of skin cancer in black individuals in the United States and in certain parts of Africa; the mortality rate for this disease is relatively high in these populations.<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/> Epidemiologic characteristics of, and prevention strategies for, SCC in those individuals with darker skin remain areas of investigation.</Para><Para id="_386">Freckling of the skin and reaction of the skin to sun exposure have been identified as other risk factors for SCC.<Reference refidx="33"/> Individuals with heavy freckling on the forearm were found to have a 14-fold increase in SCC risk if freckling was present in adulthood, and an almost threefold risk if freckling was present in childhood.<Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/> The degree of SCC risk corresponded to the amount of freckling.  In this study, the inability of the skin to tan and its propensity to burn were also significantly associated with risk of SCC (OR of 2.9 for severe burn and 3.5 for no tan).</Para><Para id="_387">The presence of scars on the skin can also increase the risk of SCC, although the process of carcinogenesis in this setting may take years or even decades.  SCCs arising in chronic wounds are referred to as Marjolin’s ulcers.

Among solid-organ transplant recipients, the risk of SCC is 65 to 250 times higher, and the risk of BCC is 10 times higher than that observed in the general population, although the risks vary with transplant type.<Reference refidx="37"/><Reference refidx="38"/><Reference refidx="39"/><Reference refidx="40"/>  Nonmelanoma skin cancers in high-risk patients (solid-organ transplant recipients and chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients) occur at a younger age, are more common and more aggressive, and have a higher risk of recurrence and metastatic spread than these cancers do in the general population.<Reference refidx="41"/><Reference refidx="42"/>  Additionally, there is a high risk of second SCCs.<Reference refidx="43"/><Reference refidx="44"/>  In one study, over 65% of kidney transplant recipients developed subsequent SCCs after their first diagnosis.<Reference refidx="43"/> Among patients with an intact immune system, BCCs outnumber SCCs by a 4:1 ratio; in transplant patients, SCCs outnumber BCCs by a 2:1 ratio.</Para><Para id="_312">This increased risk has been linked to an interaction between the level of immunosuppression and UV radiation exposure.  As the duration and dosage of immunosuppressive agents increase, so does the risk of cutaneous malignancy; this effect is reversed with decreasing the dosage of, or taking a break from, immunosuppressive agents.  Heart transplant recipients, requiring the highest rates of immunosuppression, are at much higher risk of cutaneous malignancy than liver transplant recipients, in whom much lower levels of immunosuppression are needed to avoid rejection.<Reference refidx="37"/><Reference refidx="45"/><Reference refidx="46"/>  The risk appears to be highest in geographic areas with high UV exposure.<Reference refidx="46"/> When comparing Australian and Dutch organ transplant populations, the Australian patients carried a fourfold increased risk of developing SCC and a fivefold increased risk of developing BCC.<Reference refidx="47"/>  This finding underlines the importance of rigorous sun avoidance, particularly among high-risk immunosuppressed individuals.</Para><Para id="_388">Certain immunosuppressive agents have been associated with increased risk of SCC. Kidney transplant patients who received cyclosporine in addition to azathioprine and prednisolone had a 2.8-fold increase in risk of SCC over those kidney transplant patients on azathioprine and prednisolone alone.<Reference refidx="37"/>  In cardiac transplant patients, increased incidence of SCC was seen in individuals who had received OKT3 (muromonab-CD3), a murine monoclonal antibody against the CD3 receptor.<Reference refidx="48"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_345"><Title>Personal history of nonmelanoma skin cancer</Title><Para id="_346">A personal history of BCC or SCC is strongly associated with subsequent SCC.  A study from Ireland showed that individuals with a history of BCC had a 14% higher incidence of subsequent SCC; for men with a history of BCC, the subsequent SCC risk was 27% higher.<Reference refidx="49"/>  In the same report, individuals with melanoma were also 2.5 times more likely to report a subsequent SCC.  There is an approximate 20% increased risk  of a subsequent lesion within the first year after a skin cancer has been diagnosed.

Review of the Swedish Family Center Database showed that individuals with at least one sibling or parent affected with SCC, <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> SCC (Bowen disease), or actinic keratosis had a twofold to threefold increased risk of invasive and <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> SCC relative to the general population.<Reference refidx="55"/><Reference refidx="56"/>  Increased number of tumors in parents was associated with increased risk to the offspring.  Of note, diagnosis of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460211">proband</GlossaryTermRef> at an earlier age was not consistently associated with a trend of increased incidence of SCC in the FDR, as would be expected in most hereditary syndromes because of germline mutations.

The disorders resulting from single-gene mutations within families lead to a very high risk of disease and are relatively rare.  The influence of the environment on the development of disease in individuals with these single-gene disorders is often very difficult to determine because of the rarity of the genetic mutation.</Para><Para id="_118">Identification of a strong environmental risk factor—chronic exposure to UV radiation—makes it difficult to apply genetic causation for SCC of the skin.  Although the risk of UV exposure is well known, quantifying its <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000485393">attributable risk</GlossaryTermRef> to cancer development has proven challenging.  In addition, ascertainment of cases of SCC of the skin is not always straightforward.  Many registries and other epidemiologic studies do not fully assess the incidence of SCC of the skin owing to: (1) the common practice of treating lesions suspicious for SCC without a diagnostic biopsy, and (2) the relatively low potential for metastasis.  Moreover, nonmelanoma skin cancer is routinely excluded from the major cancer registries such as the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry.</Para><Para id="_119">With these considerations in mind, the discussion below will address genes associated with disorders that have an increased incidence of skin cancer.  </Para><Para id="_458">Characteristics of the major hereditary syndromes associated with a predisposition to SCC are described in Table 4 below.</Para><Table id="_468"><Title>Table 4.

One report found that nonmelanoma skin cancer was increased 150-fold in individuals with XP; for those younger than 20 years, the prevalence was almost 5,000 times what would be expected in the general population.<Reference refidx="58"/></Para><Para id="_191">The natural history of this disease begins in the first year of life, when sun sensitivity becomes apparent, and xerosis and pigmentary changes may occur in the skin.   About half of  XP patients have a history of severe burning on minimal sun exposure. Other XP patients do not have this reaction but develop freckle-like pigmentation before age 2 years on sun-exposed sites. These manifestations progress to skin atrophy and formation of telangiectasias.  Approximately one-half of people with this disorder will develop nonmelanoma skin cancers, and approximately one-quarter of these individuals will develop melanoma.<Reference refidx="58"/> In the absence of sun avoidance, the median age of diagnosis for any skin cancer is 8 to 9 years.<Reference refidx="58"/><Reference refidx="59"/><Reference refidx="60"/> On average, nonmelanoma skin cancer occurs at a younger age than melanoma in the XP population.<Reference refidx="60"/></Para><Para id="_192">Noncutaneous manifestations of XP include ophthalmologic and neurologic abnormalities.  Disorders of the cornea and eyelids associated with this disorder are also linked to exposure to UV radiation and include keratitis, corneal opacification, ectropion or entropion, hyperpigmentation of the eyelids, and loss of eyelashes.  About 25% of the XP patients examined at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) between 1971 and 2009 had progressive neurological degeneration.<Reference refidx="60"/> Features included microcephaly, progressive sensorineural hearing loss, diminished deep tendon reflexes, seizures, and cognitive impairment.  Neurological degeneration, which is most commonly observed in individuals with complementation groups XPA and XPC, was associated with a shorter lifespan (median age of death was 29 years in individuals with neurological degeneration and 37 years in individuals without neurological degeneration).<Reference refidx="60"/> De Sanctis-Cacchione syndrome is found in a subgroup of XP patients, who exhibit  severe neurologic manifestations, dwarfism, and delayed sexual development.  A variety of noncutaneous neoplasms, most notably SCC of the tip of the tongue, central nervous system cancers, and lung cancer in smokers, have been reported in people who have XP.<Reference refidx="58"/><Reference refidx="61"/> The relative risk for these cancers is estimated to be about 50-fold higher than in the general population.<Reference refidx="58"/></Para><Para id="_193">The inheritance for XP is <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000339339">autosomal recessive</GlossaryTermRef>.  Seven complementation groups have been associated with this disorder.  About 40% of the XP cases seen at the NIH were XPC. <GeneName>ERCC2</GeneName> (<GeneName>XPD</GeneName>) mutations were present in about 20%. Complementation group A, due to mutation in <GeneName>XPA</GeneName>, accounts for approximately 10% of cases.<Reference refidx="60"/> Other mutated genes in this disorder include <GeneName>ERCC3</GeneName> (<GeneName>XPB</GeneName>), <GeneName>ERCC2</GeneName> (<GeneName>XPD</GeneName>), <GeneName>DDB2</GeneName> (<GeneName>XPE</GeneName>), <GeneName>ERCC4</GeneName> (<GeneName>XPF</GeneName>), and <GeneName>ERCC5</GeneName> (<GeneName>XPG</GeneName>).  An XPH group had been described but is now considered to be a subgroup of the XPD group.<Reference refidx="62"/> Heterozygotes for mutations in XP genes are generally asymptomatic.<Reference refidx="63"/> Founder mutations in <GeneName>XPA</GeneName> (R228A) and <GeneName>XPC</GeneName> (V548A fs X572) have been identified in North African populations, and a founder mutation in <GeneName>XPC</GeneName> resulting in a splice alteration (IVS 12-1G&gt;C) has been found in an East African (Mahori) population. It has been proposed that direct screening for these mutations would be appropriate in these populations.<Reference refidx="64"/><Reference refidx="65"/><Reference refidx="66"/><Reference refidx="67"/></Para><Para id="_194">The function of the XP genes is to recognize and repair photoproducts from UV radiation.  The main photoproducts are formed at adjacent pyrimidines and consist of cyclobutane dimers and pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts. The product of <GeneName>XPC</GeneName> is involved in the initial identification of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045671">DNA</GlossaryTermRef> damage; it binds to the lesion to act as a marker for further repair.  The DDB2 (XPE) protein is also part of this process and works with XPC.  The <GeneName>XPA</GeneName> gene product maintains single-strand regions during repair and works with the TFIIH <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000390290">transcription</GlossaryTermRef> factor complex.  The TFIIH complex includes the gene products of both <GeneName>ERCC3</GeneName> (<GeneName>XPB</GeneName>) and <GeneName>ERCC2</GeneName> (<GeneName>XPD</GeneName>), which function as DNA helicases in the unwinding of the DNA.  The ERCC4 (XPF) and ERCC5 (XPG) proteins act as DNA endonucleases to create single-strand nicks in the 5’ and 3’ sides of the damaged DNA with resulting 
excision of about 28 to 30 nucleotides, including the 
photoproduct.  DNA polymerases replace the lesion with the correct sequence, and a DNA ligase completes the repair.<Reference refidx="68"/><Reference refidx="69"/></Para><Para id="_505">An XP variant that is associated with mutations in <GeneName>POLH</GeneName> (XPV) is responsible for approximately 10% of reported cases.<Reference refidx="70"/> This gene encodes for the error-prone bypass polymerase (polymerase eta) which, unlike other genes associated with XP, is not involved in nucleotide excision repair. People with polymerase eta mutations have the same cutaneous and ocular findings as other XP patients but do not have progressive neurologic degeneration.<Reference refidx="71"/></Para><Para id="_195">Work on genotype-<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460203">phenotype</GlossaryTermRef> correlations among the XP complementation groups continues.  The main distinguishing features appear to be the presence or absence of burning on minimal sun exposure,  skin cancer, and progressive neurologic abnormalities.  All complementation groups are characterized by the presence of cutaneous neoplasia.  There is clinical variation within each complementation group. Mild to severe neurologic impairment has been described in  individuals with <GeneName>XPA</GeneName> mutations.  Individuals with <GeneName>XPA</GeneName> mutations in the DNA binding region (amino acids 98–219) may have a more severe presentation that includes neurological findings.<Reference refidx="72"/> A very small number of people in the XPB, XPD, and XPG complementation groups have been identified as having xeroderma pigmentosum-Cockayne syndrome (XP-CS) complex.  These individuals have characteristics of both disorders, including an increased predisposition to cutaneous neoplasms and developmental delay, visual and hearing impairment, and central and peripheral nervous system dysfunction.  It should be noted that people with Cockayne syndrome without XP do not appear to have an increased cancer risk.<Reference refidx="73"/> Similarly, trichothiodystrophy (TTD) is another genetic disorder that can occur in combination with XP. Individuals affected solely with TTD do not appear to have an increased cancer incidence, but some affected with XP/TTD have an increased risk of cutaneous neoplasia.  The complementation groups connected with XP/TTD (XPD and XPB) and XP-CS (XPB, XPD, and XPG) are associated with defects in both transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair and global genomic nucleotide excision repair. In contrast,  XP complementation groups C and E have defects only in global genomic nucleotide excision repair.<Reference refidx="74"/>  In addition, individuals in the XPA, XPD and XPG groups may exhibit severe neurologic abnormalities without symptoms of Cockayne syndrome or TTD.  Cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal syndrome, which has been described with some <GeneName>ERCC2</GeneName> (<GeneName>XPD</GeneName>) or XP-CS mutations, does not appear to confer an increased risk of skin cancer.<Reference refidx="75"/><Reference refidx="76"/><Reference refidx="77"/><Reference refidx="78"/></Para><Para id="_198">The diagnosis of XP is made on the basis of clinical findings and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000302456">family history</GlossaryTermRef>.

However, valuable information has been developed from the clinical management experience related to skin cancer risk and treatment in the XP population.  Strict sun avoidance beginning in infancy, use of protective clothing, and close clinical monitoring of the skin are key components to management of XP. Full-body photography of the skin, conjunctivae, and eyelids is recommended to aid in follow-up. Although few studies on treatment of SCC in the XP population have been done,  in most cases treatment is similar to what would be recommended for the general population.  Actinic keratoses are treated with topical therapies such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen, or dermabrasion, whereas cutaneous cancers are generally managed surgically.<Reference refidx="215"/></Para><Para id="_256"><LOERef href="CDR0000531846">Level of evidence: 5</LOERef></Para><Para id="_257">Oral isotretinoin has been used as chemoprevention in XP patients with promising results.  A small study of daily use of isotretinoin (13-cis retinoic acid; given as 2 mg/kg/day) reduced nonmelanoma skin cancer incidence by 63% in a small number of people with XP.  Toxicities associated with this treatment included mucocutaneous symptoms, abnormalities in liver function tests and triglyceride levels, and musculoskeletal symptoms such as arthralgias, calcifications of tendons and ligaments, and osteoporosis.<Reference refidx="216"/><Reference refidx="217"/>  Dose reduction to 0.5 mg/kg/day  reduced toxicity and decreased skin cancer frequency in three of seven subjects (43%); increasing the dose to 1 mg/kg/day resulted in decreased skin cancer frequency in three of the four subjects who did not respond at the lower dose.<Reference refidx="218"/> Oral isotretinoin use may be useful as a chemopreventive agent in other hereditary skin cancer syndromes, including basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS), Rombo syndrome, and epidermodysplasia verruciformis.<Reference refidx="219"/></Para><Para id="_258"><LOERef href="CDR0000531815">Level of evidence (oral isotretinoin for XP): 3aii</LOERef></Para><Para id="_790"><LOERef href="CDR0000531821">Level of evidence (oral isotretinoin for BCNS, Rombo syndrome, epidermodysplasia verruciformis): 5</LOERef></Para><Para id="_389">Topical T4N5 liposome lotion, containing the bacterial enzyme T4 endonuclease V, was also investigated as a chemopreventive agent in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 30 XP patients.<Reference refidx="220"/>  Although no effect was seen on incidence of SCC, 17.7 fewer actinic keratoses per year were seen in the treatment group.

Topical 5-FU demonstrated some efficacy, but in some cases viable tumor remained in the deeper dermis. The systemic chemotherapy resulted in one complete response and three partial responses in a total of five patients, suggesting that this therapy may be an option for treatment of extensive lesions.<Reference refidx="221"/> A dose reduction of 30% to 50% has been recommended for systemic chemotherapeutic agents in this population because of the  increased sensitivity of XP cells.<Reference refidx="222"/></Para><Para id="_260"><LOERef href="CDR0000531844">Level of evidence: 3diii</LOERef></Para><Para id="_261">For people who have genetic disorders other than XP, data are lacking, but general sun-safety measures remain important.  Careful protection of the skin and eyes is the mainstay of prevention in all patients with increased susceptibility to skin cancer. Key points include avoidance of sun exposure at peak hours, protective clothing and lenses, and vigilant use of sunscreen. Avoidance of x-ray therapy has also been advocated for some groups with hereditary skin cancer syndromes, such as those with epidermodysplasia verruciformis.<Reference refidx="128"/> However, XP patients with unresectable skin cancers or internal cancers, such as spinal cord astrocytoma or glioblastomas of the brain, have been treated successfully with standard therapeutic doses of x-ray radiation.<Reference refidx="61"/> Some experts recommend dermatologic evaluation every 6 months and ophthalmologic evaluation at least annually in these high-risk populations.</Para><Para id="_278"><LOERef href="CDR0000531821">Level of evidence: 5</LOERef></Para><Para id="_464">For individuals with DEB, wound care is paramount.

Multivitamin supplementation, often at higher doses  than those routinely recommended for the general population, may be warranted.<Reference refidx="223"/>

There are different patterns of sun exposure associated with each major type of skin cancer:  basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and melanoma.</Para><Para id="_292">While there is no standard measure, sun exposure has generally been classified as intermittent or chronic, and its effects may be considered short-term or cumulative. Intermittent sun exposure is, by definition, sporadic, and is commonly associated with recreational activities, particularly among indoor workers who use weekend or vacation time to be outdoors and whose skin has not adapted to the sun. Chronic sun exposure is incurred by consistent, repetitive sun exposure, usually during outdoor work or more extensive recreational activities. Acute sun exposure is obtained over a short time on skin that has not adapted to the sun. Depending on the time of day and the skin type of the individual, acute sun exposure may result in sunburn. In epidemiology studies, sunburn is usually defined as an injury associated with pain and/or blistering that lasts for 2 or more days. Cumulative sun exposure is the additive amount of sun exposure that one receives over a lifetime. The impact of cumulative sun exposure likely reflects the additive effects of intermittent sun exposure or chronic sun exposure, or both.</Para><Para id="_293">Different patterns of sun exposure appear to lead to different types of skin cancer among susceptible individuals. Intermittent sun exposure seems to be the most important risk factor for melanoma.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>  Analytic epidemiologic studies have shown only modest risks related to sun exposure in melanoma development; three systematic reviews have demonstrated similar estimates for the role of intermittent sun exposure (i.e., odds ratios [ORs] of 1.6 to 1.7).<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>  Chronic sun exposure, as observed in those occupationally exposed to sunlight, is either protective or without increased risk for the development of melanoma (see Table 6). The biological mechanisms underlying these differences in melanoma risk by sun exposure type have not been fully elucidated.</Para><Table id="_262"><Title>Table 6.

Data from Australia and Italy show that individuals who migrate from areas of low exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, such as the United Kingdom, to areas of high exposure, such as Australia or Israel, before they reach age 10 years have a lifetime risk of developing melanoma that is similar to that of people in the new country.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/> Alternatively, adolescents or older individuals who migrate from areas of low solar exposure to areas of high solar exposure have a risk that is more similar to that of people from their area of origin  than to that of people in the new area.  These data have often been cited as indicating that childhood sun exposure is more important than adult sun exposure in melanoma development. However, the data could also be interpreted as suggesting that the length of high-level exposure is more critical than the age at exposure. Thus, people who migrate early in life to a high-insolation region have a longer potential period for intense exposure than do those individuals who migrate later in life.</Para><Para id="_298">Data from Connecticut have shown that cumulative lifetime exposure to ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation does not differ between melanoma cases and controls; rather, intermittent sun exposure is the more important risk factor.<Reference refidx="11"/> The risks related to intermittent sun exposure are even greater if this pattern is experienced both early in life and later in life. These data can also be interpreted as suggesting that sun exposure patterns are rather consistent and stable throughout one's lifetime (i.e.,  that individuals who receive a great deal of intermittent sun exposure during early life are also likely to receive a great deal of intermittent sun exposure during later life). Nonetheless, an intermittent pattern of sun exposure over many years appears to significantly increase melanoma risk.</Para><Para id="_351">The relationship between sun exposure, sunscreen use, and the development of skin cancer is also complex. It is complicated by “negative confounding” (i.e., subjects who are extremely sun sensitive deliberately engage in fewer activities in direct sunlight, and they are more likely to wear sunscreen when they do). These subjects are genetically susceptible to the development of skin cancer by virtue of their cutaneous <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460203">phenotype</GlossaryTermRef> and thus may develop skin cancer regardless of the amount of sunlight exposure or the sun protection factor of the sunscreen.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_299"><Title>Other environmental factors</Title><Para id="_300">There are a number of additional environmental factors that are important to melanoma development (see Table 7).</Para><Table id="_263"><Title>Table 7.

Linkage analysis looks for evidence of coinheritance of known genetic markers within families that have multiple cases of a particular cancer (linkage) and generally is used to identify high-penetrance genes. The other method, GWAS, looks for polymorphisms, or genetic markers, that are more common in cases than in controls (i.e., they are associated).

Both methods usually result in a location on a chromosome associated with cancer risk without definitive identification of the specific gene or sequence alteration that causes the risk. Using the knowledge of the full sequence of the human genome, candidate genes are proposed based on location and gene function. Further experiments in patients, families, tumor tissue, animal models, cell culture, and/or other methods are needed to firmly identify the cancer risk gene. Sometimes gene identification is essentially simultaneous with the locus discovery. At other times, there is a lag, sometimes of years. In these cases, there is often a discussion of "risk loci" and "candidate genes." In melanoma risk inheritance, the gene <GeneName>CDKN2A</GeneName> was identified relatively rapidly after the linkage studies.

Implementation of pancreatic screening in the <GeneName>CDKN2A</GeneName> mutation carrier population is further complicated by the apparent lack of increased incidence of pancreatic cancer in many of these families.</Para><Para id="_406">Most experts suggest that pancreatic cancer screening should be considered for <GeneName>CDKN2A</GeneName> mutations carriers only if there is a family history of pancreatic cancer and, even then, only in the context of a clinical trial.  </Para><Para id="_407"><LOERef href="CDR0000531846">Level of evidence: 5</LOERef></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_408"><Title>General population</Title><SummarySection id="_46"><Title>Screening</Title><Para id="_244">Screening for melanoma is not recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), although the American Cancer Society, the Skin Cancer Foundation, and the American Academy of Dermatology recommend monthly skin self-examination and regular examination by a physician for people older than 50 years or those with multiple melanomas or dysplastic nevus syndrome.  USPSTF does not recommend screening because they judge that the evidence for efficacy is not strong.  On the other hand, the groups who recommend screening base their support on the logic that screening will find melanomas early in their development and that those melanomas will not progress further.  This position is supported by the unusually detailed prognostic information that can be obtained through histopathology examination of primary melanoma tumors, in which a variety of features (lack of invasion through the basement membrane, thin cancers [≤ 0.76 mm], absence of vertical growth phase disease, ulceration, and histologic regression) have been solidly linked to favorable prognosis.<Reference refidx="199"/></Para><Para id="_361">The question of whether the lesions found through screening are programmed to progress or whether they will grow very slowly and never progress to metastatic disease has not been answered.<Reference refidx="200"/> One study showed that skin self-examination might prevent the formation of melanomas and that skin self-examination was associated with reduced 5-year mortality.  The primary preventive effect could be biased by the fact that healthy individuals who participate in studies are somewhat more likely to participate in screening activities.<Reference refidx="201"/>  The 63% reduction in mortality observed in that study was not statistically significant.  Therefore, until a randomized trial of screening and mortality is undertaken, the utility of general population screening remains uncertain.</Para><Para id="_380">Nonetheless, it is well documented that, when a patient is under the care of a dermatologist, his or her second melanoma is diagnosed at a thinner Breslow depth than the index melanoma.<Reference refidx="202"/><Reference refidx="203"/><Reference refidx="204"/> As survival is inversely correlated with Breslow depth for melanoma, early diagnosis leads to better prognosis.</Para><Para id="_245"><LOERef href="CDR0000526280">Level of evidence: 5</LOERef></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_207"><Title>Primary prevention</Title><Para id="_246">Primary prevention for melanoma consists of avoiding intense intermittent exposure to UV radiation, both solar and nonsolar.  It should be stressed that the dose-response levels for such exposure are not defined, but that large, sporadic doses of UV radiation on skin are those epidemiologically most associated with later development of melanoma.  Sunburn is a marker of that exposure, so that the amount of time spent in the sun should be calculated to avoid sunburn if at all possible.<Reference refidx="205"/> Tanning beds should be avoided, as studies suggest that they increase the risk of melanoma.<Reference refidx="206"/><Reference refidx="207"/></Para><Para id="_247">Primary prevention should stress the need for caution in the sun and protection in the form of clothing, shade, and sunscreens when long  periods of time are spent outdoors or at times of day when sunburn is likely. High-risk patients should understand that the application of sunscreens should not be used to prolong the time they spend in the sun because UV radiation makes its way through the sunscreen over time.<Reference refidx="208"/><Reference refidx="209"/> However, regular sunscreen use has been shown to reduce melanoma incidence in a prospective, randomized controlled trial.<Reference refidx="210"/></Para><Para id="_248"><LOERef href="CDR0000526277">Level of evidence: 1aii</LOERef></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_208"><Title>Treatment</Title><Para id="_249">As described in the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062917" url="/types/skin/hp/melanoma-treatment-pdq">Melanoma Treatment</SummaryRef>, therapeutic options range widely from local excision in early melanoma to chemotherapy, radiation, and aggressive management in metastatic melanoma.

The intervention group showed improvements in knowledge about melanoma, confidence in seeing a dermatologist and having a screening examination, and greater improvements in skin self-examination practices compared with control participants after 12 months; both groups showed twofold increases in physician examinations after 12 months; there was no change in sunscreen behaviors in either group.<Reference refidx="19"/></Para><Para id="_905">In another study, 443 family members of melanoma patients were randomly assigned to either a generic or tailored intervention that consisted of three (untailored or tailored) print mailings and one (untailored or tailored) telephone counseling 
session. Overall, the tailored intervention group showed an almost twofold increase in frequency of total cutaneous skin examinations by a health care provider compared with the generic intervention. However, no differences were observed for skin self-examinations between intervention arms. In contrast to the previous study, which did not show improvements in sun protection habits,<Reference refidx="19"/> participants in this study who received the tailored intervention were significantly more likely to report improvements in sun protection habits than were those who received the generic intervention.<Reference refidx="20"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_891"><Title>Psychosocial Outcomes of Genetic Counseling and Genetic Testing</Title><Para id="_431">A few small studies have examined distress and behavioral factors associated with <GeneName>CDKN2A</GeneName> testing for melanoma.  In a Swedish clinic for individuals at high risk of melanoma resulting from dysplastic nevus syndrome, 11  unaffected, untested individuals drawn from families in which a <GeneName>CDKN2A</GeneName> mutation has been identified were examined. Most (9 of 11) reported no worry about increased melanoma risk.  In assessments after disclosure of results, there were no increasing trends towards depression, anxiety, or increased melanoma-risk perception by test results, and no systematic change in sun-related habits by test results.<Reference refidx="25"/>    </Para><Para id="_903">A prospective study examined interest in and 3-month behavioral and psychosocial outcomes associated with disclosure of melanoma high-risk mutation research results in 19 individuals (three <GeneName>CDKN2A</GeneName> carriers).<Reference refidx="18"/> All of the mutation carriers, but only four of the noncarriers, had a family history of melanoma.   Carrier status did not affect risk perception, distress, or sun-protection behaviors. </Para><Para id="_755">In a randomized controlled trial, 73 adults with a family history of melanoma were randomly assigned to receive either genetic counseling with genotyping results (<GeneName>CDKN2A</GeneName> and <GeneName>MC1R</GeneName>) or usual care. Overall, participants in the intervention group reported a significant increase in frequency of skin self-examinations, compared with a slight decrease among those in the control group. In addition, intervention participants reported a smaller decrease in frequency of wearing a shirt for sun protection compared with control participants. No other differences in sun protection habits were noted. These results should be interpreted with caution, as only five individuals (three in the intervention arm) had a deleterious mutation for one or both of the genes. Nonetheless, study results support the notion that genetic testing for melanoma does not lead to false reassurance and reduced sun protection behaviors among those who test negative.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para><Para id="_459">Another study examined behavioral factors associated with <GeneName>CDKN2A</GeneName> carrier status among 64 individuals from two large Utah families in which a <GeneName>CDKN2A</GeneName> mutation had been identified. The individuals received extensive recommendations for sun protection and screening. Questionnaires conducted one month after receipt of genetic test results and recommendations  showed increased intention for skin examinations (self-examinations and health care professional examinations), regardless of whether individuals were found to be <GeneName>CDKN2A</GeneName> carriers or noncarriers. Rates of over screening  (&gt;1 skin self-examination per month) also increased in <GeneName>CDKN2A</GeneName> carriers.<Reference refidx="27"/>  In a follow-up study one month later with the same sample, <GeneName>CDKN2A</GeneName> carriers showed marginally increased intentions for sun-protective  behaviors; <GeneName>CDKN2A</GeneName> noncarriers showed no increase in overall photoprotection but a shift to using sun-protective clothing rather than sun avoidance.<Reference refidx="28"/> Thirty-seven individuals from the same cohort were assessed for psychosocial and behavioral outcomes 2 years posttesting. Levels of anxiety, depression, melanoma worry, and pancreatic cancer worry were all low and decreased over time, with more perceived benefits of testing noted than drawbacks of testing.<Reference refidx="29"/> Adherence to annual total-body skin examinations significantly increased among unaffected carriers (from 40% at baseline to 70% at 2 years) but decreased among unaffected noncarriers (from 56% at baseline to 13% at 2 years). Affected carriers were adherent at both assessments (91% and 82%, respectively).<Reference refidx="30"/>  </Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="14574160">de Snoo FA, Bergman W, Gruis NA: Familial melanoma: a complex disorder leading to controversy on DNA testing.
