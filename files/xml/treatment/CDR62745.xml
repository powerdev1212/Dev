men.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/>  The mean age at diagnosis is between 60 and 70 years, though men of all
ages can be affected with the disease.
</Para><SummarySection id="_74"><Title>Risk Factors</Title><Para id="_3">Predisposing risk factors <Reference refidx="5"/> appear to include radiation exposure, estrogen
administration, and diseases associated with hyperestrogenism, such as
cirrhosis or Klinefelter syndrome.<Reference refidx="6"/>  Definite familial
tendencies are evident with an increased incidence seen in men who have a number of female
relatives with breast cancer.  An increased risk of male breast cancer has been
reported in families in which the <GeneName>BRCA2</GeneName> mutation on chromosome 13q has been
identified.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/>
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_75"><Title>Histopathology</Title><Para id="_4">The pathology is similar to that of female breast cancer, and infiltrating
ductal cancer is the most common tumor type.<Reference refidx="9"/>  Intraductal cancer has been
described as well.  Inflammatory carcinoma and Paget disease of the nipple
have also been seen in men, but lobular carcinoma <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> has not.<Reference refidx="9"/>  Lymph
node involvement and the hematogenous pattern of spread are similar to those
found in female breast cancer.  The TNM staging system for male breast cancer
is identical to the staging system for female breast cancer.

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_76"><Title>Prognostic Factors</Title><Para id="_5">Prognostic factors that have been evaluated include the size of the lesion and the
presence or absence of lymph node involvement, both of which correlate well
with prognosis.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="10"/>  Whether ploidy and S phase correlate with survival is
uncertain.<Reference refidx="11"/> Estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor status and <GeneName>HER2/neu</GeneName> gene amplification should  be reported.<Reference refidx="12"/>
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_77"><Title>Survival</Title><Para id="_6">Overall survival is similar to that of women with breast cancer.  The
impression that male breast cancer has a worse prognosis may stem from the
tendency toward diagnosis at a later stage.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="13"/>

therapy have been used and can increase survival to the same extent as in women
with breast cancer.  Currently,  no controlled studies have compared adjuvant
treatment options.  Approximately 85% of all male breast cancers are estrogen
receptor–positive, and 70% of them are progesterone receptor–positive.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="6"/>  Response
to hormone therapy correlates with presence of receptors.  Hormonal therapy has
been recommended in all receptor-positive patients.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>    Tamoxifen
