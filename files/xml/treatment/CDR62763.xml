Risk increases dramatically after age 50 years; 90% of all CRCs are diagnosed after this age.   The history of CRC in a first-degree relative,   especially if before the age of 55 years, roughly doubles the risk.  A personal history of CRC, high risk adenomas, or ovarian cancer also increases the risk.<Reference refidx="1"/> Other risk factors are weaker than age and family history.  
People with inflammatory bowel disease have a much higher risk of CRC.   A small percentage (&lt;5%) of CRCs occur in people with a genetic predisposition, including familial adenomatous polyposis  and hereditary nonpolyposis coli.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="24890416">Imperiale TF, Juluri R, Sherer EA, et al.: A risk index for advanced neoplasia on the second surveillance colonoscopy in patients with previous adenomatous polyps.

NSAIDs include not only aspirin (ASA, which is considered separately here) and other, first-generation nonselective inhibitors of the two functional isoforms of COX, termed COX-1 and COX-2, but also newer second-generation drugs that inhibit primarily COX-2.

Among women in the combined estrogen plus progestin group of the WHI, an extended follow-up (mean, 11.6 years) confirmed that fewer CRC were diagnosed in the combined hormone therapy group than in the placebo group (HR = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56–0.94); the CRCs in women in the combined group were more likely to have lymph node involvement than  the CRCs in women in the placebo group (50.5% vs. 28.6%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001) and were classified at higher stages (regional and distant) (68.8% vs. 51.4%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .003).   The number of CRC deaths in the combined group was higher than in the placebo group (37 vs. 27 deaths), but the difference was not statistically significant (HR = 1 .29; 95% CI, 0.78–2.11).<Reference refidx="75"/></Para><Para id="_1113">The  estrogen-only intervention component of the WHI was conducted among women who had a hysterectomy, with CRC incidence included as a secondary trial endpoint.

Tumor stage and grade were similar in the two groups; deaths after CRC were 34% in the hormone group compared with 30% in the placebo group (HR = 1.34; 95% CI, 0.58–3.19).<Reference refidx="76"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1047"><Title>Polyp removal</Title><Para id="_1048">An analysis of data from the National Polyp Study (NPS), with external, historical controls, has commonly been cited to show a reduction of 76% to 90% in the subsequent incidence of CRC after colonoscopic polypectomy compared with three nonconcurrent, historical control groups.<Reference refidx="77"/> This study may be biased in several ways that inflate the apparent efficacy of polyp removal; the main problem is that potential enrollees in the NPS were excluded if they had CRC at their baseline examination.  Because no such exclusions (or baseline colonoscopy examinations) were done in the three comparison groups, persons who had CRC at baseline would be counted as having incident CRC in subsequent follow-up.  Although adjustments were attempted, it is not possible to know the magnitude of the impact of this problem on the result because it is not known how long CRC may be present without causing symptoms.</Para><Para id="_1103">A long-term follow-up study (median follow-up, 15.8 years; maximum, 23 years) of the NPS cohort suggested an approximately 53% reduction in CRC mortality due to polypectomy (not just exclusion of persons with CRC at initial exam). However, the degree of reduction must be viewed with caution because this study did not have a direct comparison group, relying mainly on comparison to expected data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program.  Further, details are not clear about exactly what   the program of colonoscopy  was that may have led to decreased mortality. Patients in the NPS were assigned to colonoscopy at years 1 and 3; colonoscopy was also offered to one of the two comparison groups at year 1; all participants were offered colonoscopy at year 6.

Based on sigmoidoscopy findings, persons were considered to have low risk if they had normal exams or only one or two small (&lt;1 cm) tubular adenomas; such persons were not referred either for colonoscopy workup, or for colonoscopic surveillance.  In a follow-up of 10 years, the left-sided CRC incidence in the low-risk group (about 95% of attendees were low risk) was 0.02% to 0.04% per year—a very low risk of CRC compared with average risk.  The cause of reduced risk—whether due to detection and removal of large polyps or small ones, or selection of individuals at lower risk—is yet unclear.<Reference refidx="79"/>  The natural history of large polyps is not well known, but some evidence suggests that such lesions become clinical CRC at a rate of approximately 1% per year.<Reference refidx="80"/> As a result of the strong data about the impact of endoscopy on the left colon, evidence from multiple studies has raised questions about the ability of endoscopy to reduce CRC mortality in the right colon.<Reference refidx="81"/><Reference refidx="82"/><Reference refidx="83"/>  Thus, it is unclear what the overall impact of endoscopy (e.g., colonoscopy screening) is, and whether there may be a large difference in impact on the left side of the colon compared with the right side.<Reference refidx="81"/></Para><Para id="_1050">Other studies suggest that the polyps with the greatest potential to progress to CRC are larger polyps (i.e., &gt;1.0 cm), which include most of those with villous or high-grade histologic features.

the increased risk of CRCs associated with meat consumption

low levels of fruit and vegetable consumption were compared with those having the
highest levels.  For women and men combined, the covariate-adjusted RR of colon cancer associated with one additional serving of fruits and

Limitations of this study are that dietary intake during the study period was
