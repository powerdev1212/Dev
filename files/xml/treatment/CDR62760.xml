Women were randomly assigned to receive multimodality screening with CA-125 as a primary test and TVS as a secondary screen (multimodal group); an ultrasound only (ultrasound group); or no routine screening (control group).   Of the 50,639 women randomly assigned to receive ultrasound screening, 48,230 attended the first-year screening, with 48,053 women with data to evaluate ovarian morphology.   Of these, 9.1% (4,367) had an abnormal adnexal scan.  Among women with an abnormal scan, the absolute risk of epithelial ovarian cancer in the next 3 years was 1.08%.  Thus, most of these abnormal scans represented a false-positive test result.   In the ultrasound group, 11,982 women had both ovaries visualized and normal scans at all UKCTOCS annual visits during the 3-year study period.  Among this group, eight women were diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer within 3 years of the first scan.</Para><Para id="_120">The UKCTOCS published sensitivity and specificity results from their prevalent screen.  The ultrasound-screening arm had several levels of screening and possible referral strategies: an abnormal scan resulted in a repeat scan in 6 to 8 weeks, and if still abnormal, a referral was made for clinical assessment. Of 53 total cancers (screen-detected and interval cancers in the following year), 45 were screen positive by ultrasound (two abnormal scans) for a sensitivity of 84.9%. For invasive cancer, the sensitivity was 75%. Specificity of the ultrasound-screening arm was calculated to be 98.2%.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_121"><Title>CA-125 concentrations</Title><Para id="_122">CA-125 is a tumor-associated antigen that is used clinically to monitor patients with epithelial ovarian carcinomas.<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/>  Measurement of CA-125 concentrations has been proposed as a potential marker for the early detection of ovarian cancer, either as a single test with a threshold cutpoint or in algorithms examining the change in levels over time.  The two randomized trials have included CA-125 either in parallel or sequentially with TVU for multimodality screening.  The most commonly reported CA-125 reference value that designates a positive screening test is 35 U/mL, and this was the reference value used in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Screening Trial (<ProtocolRef href="CDR0000078532" nct_id="NCT00002540">NCT00002540</ProtocolRef>) to define an abnormal test result.

The estimated sensitivity for early-stage disease (stage I and II ovarian cancer) was 56% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49%–72%) for a cutpoint set to obtain a fixed specificity of 95%.  The threshold for the cutpoint for CA-125 at 95% specificity was 24 U/mL.  For all cases (56% of cases had stage III or IV disease at diagnosis), the sensitivity was 73% (95% CI, 64%–84%).  When the clinical cutpoint of 35 U/mL was used, the sensitivity decreased.<Reference refidx="24"/></Para><Para id="_124">A CA-125 screening program of 22,000
postmenopausal women with subsequent transabdominal ultrasound for those with
elevated CA-125 levels (reference value of 30 U/mL) detected 11 of 19 cases of
ovarian cancer occurring in the cohort, for an apparent sensitivity of 58%.<Reference refidx="25"/> 
The specificity for this screening study was 99.9%.  Three of the 11 cases
detected through screening were stage I disease.  In one prospective screening
study, the specificity of CA-125 levels of 35 U/mL was 97.6%.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para><Para id="_125">Evaluation of longitudinal measurements, incorporating the information into an algorithm termed “risk of ovarian cancer algorithm” or ROCA, is being evaluated in the UKCTOCS.  The UKCTOCS is evaluating two-stage screening with ROCA as the primary screen and TVS as a secondary screen (based on results of the ROCA) for its impact on ovarian cancer mortality compared with TVS alone or no screening.  Estimated sensitivity data for multimodality two-stage screening with ROCA followed by TVS has been published from the prevalent screen.  Of the 50,078 women who underwent the prevalent screen in the multimodality screening arm, 409 were determined to have an intermediate or elevated risk of ovarian cancer based on the ROCA and were referred for TVS.  Of the 409 women,167 women were referred for clinical evaluation, 97 underwent surgery, and 42 were diagnosed with either malignant ovarian or fallopian tube cancers.  Among the women who had negative screens, five were diagnosed with ovarian or fallopian tube cancer within 1 year of screening.  The estimated sensitivity was 89.4% (95% CI, 76.9–96.5%).<Reference refidx="13"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_126"><Title>Combined CA-125 and TVU</Title><Para id="_127">The objective of the ovarian component of the PLCO trial was to evaluate the effect of screening on ovarian cancer mortality.  The trial included 78,216 women aged 55 to 74 years who were randomly assigned to undergo either annual screening  (n = 39,105) or usual care (n = 39,111) at ten screening centers across the United States between November
1993 and July 2001.  The intervention group was offered annual screening with CA-125 for
6 years and TVU for 4 years. Participants and their health care practitioners
received the screening test results and managed evaluation of abnormal results.
The usual-care group was not offered screening with CA-125 or TVU but received their usual medical care. Participants were followed for a maximum of 13 years (median, 12.4 years; range, 10.9–13.0 years)
for cancer diagnoses and death until February 28, 2010. Mortality from ovarian cancer, including primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers, was the main outcome measure. Secondary outcomes included ovarian cancer incidence
and complications associated with screening examinations and diagnostic procedures.<Reference refidx="27"/></Para><Para id="_128">Compliance with screening ranged from 85% at the initial round to 73% at the sixth round, while contamination in the usual-care group ranged from about 3.0% for CA-125  to 4.6% for TVU.  Across the first four screening rounds, 11.1% of women had at least one positive test, 8.1% had at least one positive TVU, and 3.4% had at least one positive CA-125 test.  The yields of both tests were similar. Ovarian cancer was diagnosed in 212 women (5.7 per 10,000 person-years) in the intervention group and 176 women (4.7 per 10,000 person-years) in the usual-care group (rate ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.99–1.48). The stage distributions were similar by study group, with stage III and IV cancers comprising the majority of cases in both the intervention group (163 cases, 77%) and the usual-care group (137 cases, 78%).  The cancer case treatment distributions were very similar between groups within each stage.  There were 118 deaths caused by ovarian cancer (3.1 per 10,000 person-years) in the intervention group and
100 deaths (2.6 per 10,000 person-years) in the usual-care group (mortality rate ratio, 1.18;
95% CI, 0.82–1.71). Of the 3,285 women with false-positive results, 1,080 underwent surgical
follow-up. Of the 1,080 women who underwent surgical follow-up, 163 women experienced at least one serious complication (15%).  A total of 1,771 women in the intervention group (7.7%) and 1,304 in the usual-care group (5.8%) reported oophorectomy.
There were 2,924 deaths resulting from other causes (excluding ovarian, colorectal, and lung cancer)
(76.6 per 10,000 person-years) in the intervention group and 2,914 such deaths (76.2 per
10,000 person-years) in the usual-care group (rate ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.96–1.06).<Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/></Para><Para id="_129">Among women in the general U.S. population, simultaneous screening with CA-125 and TVU did not reduce ovarian cancer mortality when compared with usual care.<Reference refidx="27"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_131"><Title>CA-125 levels</Title><Para id="_132">The Shizuoka Cohort Study of Ovarian Cancer Screening randomly assigned women to either a screening group (n = 41,668) or a control group (n = 40,799) between 1985 and 1999 at 212 hospitals in the Shizuoka prefecture of Japan. The screening protocol comprised ultrasound and CA-125 tests annually.  Women with abnormal findings were referred to a gynecological oncologist.  Ovarian cancer diagnoses were determined by record linkage to the Shizuoka Cancer Registry in 2002.  The annual death certificate file in Shizuoka was checked to ascertain vital status.  The mean follow-up time was 9.2 years, and the mean number of screens per woman was 5.4.  There were 35 ovarian cancers detected in the screening group and 32 in the control group with a nonstatistically significant difference in the stage distribution. Nine percent of regular screening attendees had at least one false-positive result.<Reference refidx="29"/> Mortality results from this trial are not available.</Para><Para id="_133">A randomized pilot trial in
the United Kingdom    randomly    assigned 10,977 women to a control group and 10,958 women
to a screened group in 1989.<Reference refidx="30"/>  The primary screen was the CA-125 test, followed by
ultrasonography when CA-125 levels were elevated.  Women were offered three annual
screening rounds, and both groups were followed for 7 years.  Compliance was
70.7% for all three screenings and 85.5% for at least one screening.  There were 20
ovarian cancers in the control group and 16 in the screened group, six of
which were detected by screening.  There was a higher proportion of stage I/II
cancers in the screened group than in the control group (31.3% vs. 10.0%).  There were 18 ovarian cancer
deaths in the control group and nine in the screened group (relative risk [RR],  2.0;

As noted previously, the ROCA method is being evaluated in the UKCTOCS in conjunction with TVS as a two-stage screening process,<Reference refidx="13"/> and results from that trial are pending.  Other methods to include multiple longitudinal CA-125 concentrations in order to examine change of CA-125 levels over time have been proposed but none have been independently evaluated for the impact on ovarian cancer mortality.  A nested study was conducted within the PLCO trial to determine if the use of ROCA could potentially improve the identification of early-stage (stage I/II) ovarian cancer.<Reference refidx="31"/>  The study evaluated the potential impact under two scenarios:  best case and stage shift.  Best case scenario assumed that all cancers that would have been detected earlier with ROCA compared with single-threshold CA-125 concentrations, would have avoided mortality.  The stage shift scenario applied the observed PLCO early-stage survival rates to cases detected at an earlier stage with ROCA.  The risk of death from ovarian cancer with ROCA was lower but estimates were not statistically significant  (RR of 0.90 for best case scenario [95% CI, 0.69–1.17] and RR of 0.95 for stage shift scenario [95% CI, 0.74–1.23]).</Para><Para id="_144">Another retrospective study using annual CA-125 concentrations from the PLCO trials examined the potential impact of parametric empirical Bayes  (PEB) longitudinal algorithm for the earlier detection of 44 incident ovarian cancers identified in PLCO.  Setting the specificity at 99%,  PEB signaled “abnormal” CA-125 concentrations on average 10 months earlier than with the single-threshold cutpoint.<Reference refidx="32"/>  Whether or not this translated into a mortality benefit could not be determined.</Para><Para id="_145">CA-125 velocity has also been examined using a multiple logistic regression model within the PLCO trial as a predictor for the development of ovarian cancer.<Reference refidx="33"/>  Both CA-125 velocity and time intervals between screening tests were associated with the development of ovarian cancer.  The risk of ovarian cancer increased as velocity (measured as U/mL per month) increased, and the risk of ovarian cancer decreased when the time intervals between screening tests increased.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_155"><Title>Other Potential Markers</Title><Para id="_156">Research continues to find other biomarkers that either alone or in combination with CA-125 concentrations may lead to the early detection of ovarian cancer.   A panel of biomarkers that included CA-125, HE4, transthyretin, CA15.3, and CA72.4 was evaluated using specimens assembled from multiple cohort and randomized trials, including the PLCO trial.<Reference refidx="24"/> The phase II and III biomarker studies concluded that CA-125 remained the “single-best biomarker”  for ovarian cancer.  Another retrospective study, nested within the PLCO trial and included 118 ovarian cancer cases and 8 controls per case,  evaluated 7 proteomic biomarkers (apolipoprotein A1, truncated transthyretin, transferrin, hepcidin, beta-2 microglobulin, connective tissue activating protein III, and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy-chain) in addition to CA-125.<Reference refidx="34"/> The addition of the seven protein biomarkers to CA-125 did not improve the sensitivity beyond the use of CA-125 levels alone.
