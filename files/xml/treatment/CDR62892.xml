cell cancer (SCC) accounts for approximately 85% of vaginal cancer cases.<Reference refidx="5"/> SCC initially spreads
superficially within the vaginal wall and later invades the paravaginal tissues
and the parametria.  Distant hematogenous metastases occur most commonly in the lungs, and less frequently in liver, bone, or other sites.<Reference refidx="5"/>  SCC of the vagina is associated with a high rate of infection with oncogenic strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) and has many risk factors in common with SCC of the cervix.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/>  HPV infection has also been described in a case of vaginal adenocarcinoma.<Reference refidx="8"/>   </Para><SummarySection id="_341"><Title>Risk Factors</Title><Para id="_199">Approximately 5% to 10% of cases of vaginal cancers are adenocarcinomas.  A rare form of adenocarcinoma (clear cell carcinoma, described below) occurs in association with <Emphasis>in utero</Emphasis> exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES), with a peak incidence at young ages (less than 30 years).  However, adenocarcinomas that are not associated with DES exposure occur primarily during postmenopausal years. </Para><Para id="_200">The association between the clear cell carcinomas and <Emphasis>in utero</Emphasis> exposure to DES was first reported in 1971.<Reference refidx="9"/> The incidence of this disease, which is highest for those exposed during the first trimester, peaked in the mid-1970s, reflecting the use of DES in the 1950s. It is extremely rare now.<Reference refidx="5"/> However, women with a known history of <Emphasis>in utero</Emphasis> DES exposure should be carefully followed for this tumor. </Para><Para id="_201">Vaginal adenosis is most commonly found in young women who had <Emphasis>in utero</Emphasis> exposure to DES and may coexist with a clear cell adenocarcinoma, though it rarely progresses to adenocarcinoma. Adenosis is replaced by squamous metaplasia, which occurs naturally, and requires follow-up but not removal. </Para><Para id="_202">Rarely, melanomas (often nonpigmented), sarcomas, or small-cell carcinomas have been described as primary vaginal cancers. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_328"><Title>Prognostic Factors</Title><Para id="_329">Patient prognosis depends primarily on the stage of disease, but survival is reduced among those who are older than 60 years, are symptomatic at the time of
diagnosis, have lesions of the middle and lower third of the vagina, or have
poorly differentiated tumors.  </Para><Para id="_330">In addition, the length of vaginal wall
involvement has been found to be associated with survival and stage
of disease in vaginal SCC  patients. </Para><Para id="_331">Non–DES-associated adenocarcinomas generally have a worse prognosis than SCC tumors, but DES-associated clear cell tumors have a relatively good prognosis.<Reference refidx="5"/>  The natural history, prognosis, and treatment of other primary vaginal cancers (i.e., sarcoma, melanoma, lymphoma, and carcinoid tumors) are different and are not covered in this summary.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_342"><Title>Treatment Options</Title><Para id="_343">
Therapeutic options depend on tumor stage; surgery and radiation therapy are highly effective in early stages, whereas radiation therapy is the primary
treatment of more advanced stages.  Chemotherapy has not been shown to be
curative for advanced vaginal cancer, and there are no standard drug regimens.

This has led to a broad range of reported disease control and survival rates for any given stage and treatment modality.<Reference refidx="1"/>  In addition, given the long time span covered by these case series, there are often changes within a given case series in the available staging tests and radiation techniques, including the shift to high-energy accelerators and conformal- and intensity-modulated radiation.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_34">Factors to be considered in planning therapy for vaginal cancer include:</Para><ItemizedList id="_109" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Stage and size of the lesion.</ListItem><ListItem>Proximity to radiosensitive organs or organs that preclude radical resection without unacceptable functional deficits (e.g., bladder, rectum, urethra).</ListItem><ListItem>Ability to retain a functional vagina.</ListItem><ListItem>Presence or absence of the uterus.</ListItem><ListItem>Whether there has been prior pelvic radiation therapy.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_203">In a series of 100 women studied retrospectively over 30 years, 50% had undergone hysterectomy prior to the diagnosis of vaginal cancer.<Reference refidx="4"/> In this posthysterectomy group, 31 of 50 (62%) women developed cancers limited to the upper third of the vagina.

Data from randomized trials are lacking and the choice of therapy is generally determined by institutional experience and the factors listed above.
  For patients with stages III and IVA disease, radiation therapy
is standard and includes  external-beam radiation, alone or with brachytherapy.  Regional lymph nodes are included in the radiation portal.  When used alone, external-beam radiation involves a 60 Gy to 70 Gy tumor dose, using shrinking fields, delivered within 6 to 7 weeks.  Intracavitary brachytherapy provides insufficient dose penetration for locally advanced tumors, so interstitial brachytherapy (75 Gy–85 Gy) is used if brachytherapy is employed.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_184">Local control is a problem with bulky tumors.  In recent years, some investigators have also used concurrent chemotherapy with agents such as cisplatin, bleomycin, mitomycin-C, floxuridine, and vincristine; but this practice has not been proven to improve outcomes.<Reference refidx="2"/>  It is an extrapolation from treatment approaches used in cervical cancer, based on shared etiologic and risk factors.</Para><Para id="_111">    For patients with stage IVB or recurrent disease that cannot be managed with local treatments, current therapy is inadequate. No established anticancer drugs can be considered of proven clinical benefit, although patients are often treated with regimens used to treat cervical cancer.

for clinical trials of anticancer drugs and/or radiosensitizers to attempt

The natural history of VAIN is not known with precision because of its rarity, but patients with VAIN 3 are felt to be at substantial risk of progression to invasive cancer and are treated immediately.
