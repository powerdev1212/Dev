The mean age-adjusted incidence of uveal melanoma in the United States is approximately 4.3 new cases per million people, with no clear variation by latitude.  Males have a higher incidence than females (4.9 vs. 3.7 per million).<Reference refidx="1"/>  The age-adjusted incidence of this cancer has remained stable since at least the early 1970s.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>  U.S. incidence rates are low compared with the rates of other reporting countries, which vary from about 5.3 to 10.9 cases per million.  Some of the variation may be the result of  differences in inclusion criteria and methods of calculation.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_342">Uveal melanoma is diagnosed mostly at older ages, with a progressively rising, age-specific, incidence rate that peaks near the age of 70 years.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_343"> Host susceptibility factors associated with the development of this cancer include:<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_344" Style="bullet">

To date, these studies have found only weak associations or yielded contradictory results.<Reference refidx="3"/> Similarly, there is no consistent evidence that occupational exposure to  UV light or other agents is a risk factor for uveal melanoma.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="5"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_300"><Title>Anatomic Location</Title><Para id="_290">Uveal melanomas can arise in the anterior (iris) or the posterior (ciliary body or choroid) uveal tract. Iris melanomas have the best prognosis, whereas melanomas of the ciliary body have the least favorable prognosis.<Reference refidx="6"/> Most uveal tract melanomas originate in the choroid. The ciliary body is less commonly a site of origin, and the iris is the least common. The comparatively low incidence of iris melanomas has been attributed to the characteristic features of these tumors, i.e., they tend to be small, slow growing, and relatively dormant in comparison with their posterior counterparts. Iris melanomas rarely metastasize.<Reference refidx="7"/> Melanomas of the posterior uveal tract generally have a more malignant, histologic appearance; are detected later; and metastasize more frequently than iris melanomas. The typical choroidal melanoma is a brown, elevated, dome-shaped subretinal mass. The degree of pigmentation ranges from dark brown to totally amelanotic. </Para><Para id="_291">Most uveal melanomas are initially completely asymptomatic. As the tumor enlarges, it may cause distortion of the pupil (iris melanoma), blurred vision (ciliary body melanoma), or markedly decreased visual acuity caused by  secondary retinal detachment (choroidal melanoma). Serous detachment of the retina may occur. If extensive detachment occurs, secondary angle-closure glaucoma occasionally develops. Clinically, several lesions simulate uveal melanoma, including metastatic carcinoma, posterior scleritis, and benign tumors, such as nevi and hemangiomas.<Reference refidx="8"/><MediaLink ref="CDR0000543553" type="image/jpeg" alt="Eye anatomy; two-panel drawing shows the outside and inside of the eye.

Melanomas of the iris are usually small discrete lesions, although they may occasionally be diffuse, infiltrative, or multiple and  may result in heterochromia, chronic uveitis, or spontaneous hemorrhage into the anterior chamber of the eye (hyphema). Iris melanomas that involve more than 66% of the angle circumference are associated with secondary glaucoma.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_114">Routine evaluation of iris melanomas includes gonioscopy, transillumination of the globe, and indirect ophthalmoscopy with 360° of scleral depression. Photographic documentation is essential to document progression in size or growth of the tumor.<Reference refidx="4"/> Anterior segment fluorescein angiography may be helpful to demonstrate the vascularity of the lesion but is not diagnostic. High-resolution ultrasound biomicroscopy can be used to measure small lesions (basal dimensions and thickness) and to assess tumor involvement of the anterior ciliary body, angle, and overlying sclera.<Reference refidx="5"/> The main disadvantage with this technology is its limited penetration of large lesions.  In these cases, conventional ultrasonography is more accurate.</Para><Para id="_115">In general, iris melanomas have relatively good outcomes. Only about 3% of these melanomas develop metastases within 5 years.<Reference refidx="1"/> Iris melanomas are predominantly of the spindle-cell type and are usually smaller in size than posterior melanomas.  Clinical features, including prominent tumor vascularity, rapid growth, and heterogeneous pigmentation, are associated with an epithelioid cell component.<Reference refidx="6"/> Involvement of the iridocorneal angles is frequently associated with ciliary body invasion.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_116">Given their rarity and good prognosis, trials with sufficient power are practical.
