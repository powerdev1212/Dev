of leukopenia (occasionally leukocytosis) and/or pancytopenia, and bone marrow
infiltration by an atypical cell with prominent cytoplasmic projections (i.e., hairy
cells).  The bone marrow is usually fibrotic and is not easily aspirated. 
Bone marrow biopsies are, therefore, required for diagnosis and evaluation of the
degree of hairy cell infiltration.

therapy) is characterized by progressive bone marrow replacement by hairy
cells with pancytopenia refractory to treatment.  For patients with advanced
hairy cell leukemia treated with cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, 2-CdA),
pentostatin, or interferon-alpha, the survival rate appears to be more than 85% at 5 years following  the initiation of any one of these therapies.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>

2-CdA) or pentostatin.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>  These drugs have comparable response rates but have
not been compared in phase III trials.  Cladribine is administered as a one-time continuous infusion or series of subcutaneous injections and is
associated with a high rate of febrile neutropenia.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>  Rarely, more than one
course of treatment is required to induce a desirable response.  Treatment
should be discontinued once complete remission or stable partial remission with

</Para><Para id="_89">The role of consolidation or maintenance therapy in preventing relapse or
progression of the disease following treatment with purine analogs has not been
evaluated and remains unproven.  Pentostatin is administered intermittently for
a longer treatment duration but may result in a lower incidence of febrile
complications.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/>  While most patients remain disease free 10 years after
treatment with these purine analogs, no patient has been followed long enough
to assess cure.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/>  Both nucleoside analogs cause profound suppression of CD4
counts, which may last for a year, and a potential increased risk of second malignancies has been reported.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_35"> 
 A study of 3,104 survivors of hairy cell leukemia from the SEER database showed an increased risk of second cancers (standardized incidence ratio,  1.24; 95% CI, 1.11–1.37), especially for Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas.<Reference refidx="13"/> The increased risk for second cancers was seen even in the 2 decades before the introduction of purine nucleosides.<Reference refidx="13"/>  With the use of cladribine, an
increased risk of second malignancies is possible among patients with hairy cell leukemia
(observed to expected ratio of about 1.8 in several series after 6 years).<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="12"/> 
Several series using pentostatin did not report an increased risk of second
malignancies.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="14"/>  For a few patients, such as those with severe
thrombocytopenia, splenectomy might be considered.<Reference refidx="15"/>  After splenectomy,
50% of patients will require no additional therapy, and long-term survivors
are common.  Therapy with interferon-alpha is another treatment option,
especially for patients with intercurrent infection.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="16"/></Para><Para id="_83">The hairy cell leukemia variant has a distinctive phenotype and typically presents with leukocytosis instead of leukopenia.<Reference refidx="17"/> Patients with this variant have poorer responses to initial cladribine, shorter durations of response, and typically do not respond again to purine analogues after relapse.  Combinations  of rituximab and purine analogues are under evaluation and further studies are required to define optimal therapies.<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/></Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="17107901">Gidron A, Tallman MS: 2-CdA in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia: a review of long-term follow-up.

Since it is easily
controlled, many patients have prolonged survival with sequential therapies. 
The decision to treat is based on cytopenias (especially if symptomatic),
increasing splenomegaly, indications that the disease is progressing, or the
presence of other, usually infectious complications.  It is reasonable to offer
no therapy if the patient is asymptomatic and blood counts are maintained in an
acceptable range.<Reference refidx="1"/>
