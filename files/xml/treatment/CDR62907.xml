one million population.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Although it mainly occurs in adults, children can be affected, too. The median age at
diagnosis is 46 years.  Historically, only about 30%
of these malignancies are confined to the adrenal gland at the time of
diagnosis.<Reference refidx="2"/> However, recently, more ACCs have been diagnosed at early states, most likely due to the widespread use of high-quality imaging techniques.  
 </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_178"><Title>Prognostic Factors</Title><Para id="_179">Retrospective studies have identified the following three important
prognostic factors:<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_180" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Completeness of resection. </ListItem><ListItem>Stage of disease. </ListItem><ListItem>Pathological grade. </ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_181">Patients who have low-grade tumors without evidence of invasion into local tissues or spread to lymph nodes have an improved prognosis. The role of other prognostic indicators is controversial. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_182"><Title>Clinical Features</Title><Para id="_183">In approximately 60% of patients, symptoms related to excessive hormone secretion are the main reasons for seeking medical attention. Biochemical hormone testing reveals that up to 80% of tumors are functioning. The second most common symptoms at time of initial presentation are unspecific abdominal symptoms, such as abdominal pain or fullness. A small percentage of ACCs is incidentally discovered by imaging studies conducted for reasons other than potential adrenal disease.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_184"><Title>Diagnosis</Title><Para id="_185">Initial evaluation should include careful endocrine studies to reveal any excessive hormone production by the tumor, which can serve as a tumor marker during therapy. Staging should include imaging of the primary site by computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen. In addition, a CT of the chest is necessary to assess potential lung metastasis. Although the use of positron emission tomography may be effective in identifying unsuspected sites of metastases, its role as a staging tool is unclear. The detection of metastatic lesions may allow effective palliation of both functioning and nonfunctioning lesions. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_186"><Title>Prognosis and Survival</Title><Para id="_187">The most common sites of metastases are the lung, liver, peritoneum, and less commonly, the bones and major veins. Palliation of metastatic functioning tumors may be achieved by resection of both the primary tumor and metastatic lesions. Unresectable or widely disseminated tumors may be palliated by adrenolytic therapy with mitotane antihormonal drugs (i.e.,  ketoconazole and metyrapone), systemic chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. However, 5-year survival for patients with stage IV tumors is usually less than 20%.<Reference refidx="2"/> </Para><Para id="_188">Although several studies have shown partial or even complete remission, there is no convincing evidence to date that systemic therapy will improve the survival duration of patients with adrenal cancer. Radical
open surgical excision is the treatment of choice for patients with localized malignancies and
remains the only method by which long-term disease-free survival may be
achieved.<Reference refidx="4"/> Overall 5-year survival is
approximately 38% to 46%.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="18973179">Bilimoria KY, Shen WT, Elaraj D, et al.: Adrenocortical carcinoma in the United States: treatment utilization and prognostic factors.

The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system <Reference refidx="1"/> is based on the following assessment:</Para><Para id="_13">The stage of adrenocortical carcinoma is determined by the size of the primary
tumor, the degree of local invasion, and whether it has spread to regional
lymph nodes or distant sites.  Proper staging should include computed
tomography (CT) of the abdomen and chest.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may add
specificity to CT evaluation of an adrenal mass.<Reference refidx="2"/>  In-phase and out-of-phase
T1-weighted imaging may be the most effective noninvasive method to
differentiate benign from malignant adrenal masses.  MRI may suggest evidence of  extracapsular tumor invasion, extension into the
vena cava, or metastases.  Patency of surrounding vessels can often be
demonstrated with gadolinium-enhanced sequences or flip-angle techniques.<Reference refidx="3"/> 

</Para><Para id="_159">In addition to the above-mentioned AJCC staging, the European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors (ENSAT) staging system is widely used internationally.<Reference refidx="4"/> The ENSAT staging system is essentially the same as the AJCC system, but reserves stage IV only for tumors with distant metastasis.
