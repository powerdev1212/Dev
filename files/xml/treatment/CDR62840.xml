Age-standardized incidence rates vary from 2.1 per 100,000 in North America <Reference refidx="2"/>
to 80 per 100,000 in China.<Reference refidx="1"/>  In the United States, it is estimated that
there will be 35,660 new cases diagnosed in 2015 and 24,550 deaths due to this disease.<Reference refidx="3"/> There is a
distinct male preponderance among all ethnic groups in the United States,
although this trend is most marked among Chinese Americans, in whom the
annualized rate of HCC among men is 21.6 per 100,000 and among women is 8.1 per
100,000 population.<Reference refidx="4"/> Chronic hepatitis B and C are recognized as the major
factors worldwide increasing the risk of HCC, with   risk being greater in the
presence of coinfection with hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/>  The
incidence of HCC in individuals with chronic hepatitis is as high as 0.46% per
year.  In the United States, chronic hepatitis B and C account for about 30% to
40% of HCC.  Chronic hepatitis G infection is not associated with HCC in either
hepatitis B surface antigen–positive carriers or noncarriers.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_9">Cirrhosis is also a risk factor for HCC, irrespective of the etiology of the
cirrhosis.  The annual risk of developing HCC among persons with cirrhosis is
between 1% and 6%.<Reference refidx="6"/>  Other risk factors include alcoholic cirrhosis,
hemochromatosis, alpha-l-antitrypsin deficiency, glycogen storage disease,
porphyria cutanea tarda, tyrosinemia, and Wilson disease,<Reference refidx="2"/> but rarely
biliary cirrhosis.<Reference refidx="9"/>  A retrospective case-control study found that features suggestive of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance, were more frequently observed in patients with HCC associated with cryptogenic cirrhosis than in those with HCC of viral or alcohol etiology.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/> Aflatoxins,  which are  mycotoxins formed by certain   <ScientificName>Aspergillus </ScientificName> species, are
a frequent contaminant of improperly stored grains and nuts.  In parts of
Africa, the high incidence of HCC in humans may by related to ingestion of
foods contaminated with aflatoxins.   This association, however, is blurred by the
frequent coexistence of hepatitis B infection in those population groups.   The likely etiology of HCC is summarized in the following table.<Reference refidx="12"/>

concept that populations at high risk for HCC, such as those with cirrhosis,
can be identified.  However, 20% to 50% of patients presenting with HCC have
previously undiagnosed cirrhosis.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>  These patients would not be recruited
into a surveillance program if the presence of cirrhosis is used to define a
target population.<Reference refidx="3"/>  The modalities potentially available for screening
include serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ultrasonography. 
 Abnormal screening results may lead to liver biopsy for diagnosis. Complications of liver biopsy are reported in 0.06% to 0.32% of patients, and typically occur within the first few hours after the biopsy. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_56"><Title>Tumor Markers for the Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</Title><Para id="_57">There are four categories of tumor markers that are currently being used or studied for the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma.  These include oncofetal antigens and glycoprotein antigens; enzymes and isoenzymes; genes; and cytokines.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><SummarySection id="_58"><Title>Alpha-fetoprotein</Title><Para id="_59">Serum AFP, a fetal-specific glycoprotein antigen, is the most widely used tumor marker for detecting patients with HCC. The reported sensitivity of AFP for detecting  HCC varies widely in both
hepatitis B virus (HBV)-positive and HBV-negative populations, which is attributable to overlap
between screening and diagnosis study designs.<Reference refidx="3"/>  When AFP is used for screening of
high-risk populations, a sensitivity of 39% to 97%, specificity of 76% to 95%,
and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 9% to 32% have been reported.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/> AFP is
not specific for HCC.  Titers also rise in acute or chronic hepatitis,<Reference refidx="10"/>
in pregnancy, and in the presence of germ cell tumors.
</Para><Para id="_60">A prospective, 16-year, population-based, observational study of screening for
hepatocellular cancer among 1,487 Alaska Natives chronically infected with
 HBV compared survival among screen-detected HCC patients with a
historical comparison group of clinically diagnosed HCC patients.<Reference refidx="8"/>  The screening
program’s target was AFP determination every 6 months.  It achieved 97%
sensitivity and 95% specificity (excluding pregnant women) for HCC.  Such high
sensitivity and specificity have not been found for other high-risk groups,
such as individuals with cirrhosis.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/>  Whether screening actually improved
survival is not clear.  </Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_16"><Title>Hepatic Ultrasound</Title><Para id="_17">Limitations in the sensitivity and specificity of AFP in surveillance of high-risk populations led to the use of ultrasound  as an additional method for
detection of HCC.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Studies in both healthy hepatitis B
surface antigen carriers <Reference refidx="5"/> and in patients with cirrhosis <Reference refidx="7"/> have defined
the performance characteristics of ultrasound as a screening test for HCC. 
Sensitivity in the former was 71% and in the latter 78%, with 93% specificity. 
The PPVs were 14% and 73%, respectively.
In a study of patients who were on a waiting list for liver transplantation, ultrasonography was found to have a sensitivity of 58%, a specificity of 94%, a negative predictive value of 91%, and a PPV of 68%.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_18"><Title>Computed Tomography </Title><Para id="_19">Limitations in the sensitivity and specificity of AFP and  ultrasound in
surveillance of high-risk populations, such as individuals with cirrhosis, led
to the assessment of computed tomography (CT) as an additional method for
detection of HCC.  Studies in patients with cirrhosis
suggest that CT may be a more sensitive test for HCC than ultrasound or AFP more than 20 μg/L.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/>
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_20"><Title>Efficacy of Screening and Surveillance Programs</Title><Para id="_32">A controlled trial of 18,816 persons aged 35 to 59 years with hepatitis B in Shanghai randomly assigned patients to a screening group using AFP and ultrasound every 6 months versus a usual-care group. HCC mortality was lower in the screened group (83.2 vs. 131.5   per 100,000; mortality rate ratio of 0.63 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.41–0.98]). While these results are promising, there were problems, including the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_92" Style="bullet">

Of these men, 3,712 were randomly assigned to a screening group and 1,869 to a control group.  Screening entailed 6-monthly AFP assays, with follow-up of patients having an abnormal (≥20 μg/L) test result.  All patients were followed up for liver cancer and/or death.  The overall sensitivity and specificity of the program were 55.3% and 86.5%, respectively.  In patients who complied with all scheduled screening tests, sensitivity was 80% and specificity was 80.9%.  The mortality rate in the screening group (1,138 per 100,000 person-years) was not significantly different from that in the control group (1,114 per 100,000 person-years), although AFP screening resulted in an earlier diagnosis of liver cancer (i.e., percentage of cases in stage I was significantly higher in the screened group [29.0%] than in the control group [6%]).<Reference refidx="16"/> A  review concluded that the method of measuring AFP was not sensitive enough to detect HCC, affecting interpretation of the negative result of this trial.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="2155700" MedlineID="90182557">Zaman SN, Johnson PJ, Williams R: Silent cirrhosis in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

Direct harms may result from complications of liver biopsy done as part of the diagnostic workup. Such complications are reported in 0.06% to 0.32% of patients, and typically occur within the first few hours after the biopsy. Complications include hemorrhage, bile peritonitis, penetration of viscera, and pneumothorax. Rarely, death occurs as a direct result of liver biopsy (0.009%–0.12%). About one third of patients experience pain at the site of entry, in the right upper quadrant, or in the right shoulder.<Reference refidx="1"/> Needle aspiration cytology and liver biopsy are rarely associated with needle-track implantation of malignant cells. Lead-time bias (earlier diagnosis in the natural
history of HCC rather than improved survival from earlier diagnosis and
treatment), length bias (earlier detection of slower-growing and less
aggressive tumors through screening), and/or overdiagnosis of HCC (detection of
tumors that will not affect morbidity or mortality) may wholly or partially
account for the improved 5-year and 10-year survival rates reported.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="8542662" MedlineID="96127523">Tobkes AI, Nord HJ: Liver biopsy: review of methodology and complications.
