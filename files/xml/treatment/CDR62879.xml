 480,000 deaths each year.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> (<ExternalRef xref="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6347a4.htm">Also available online.</ExternalRef>) On average, these deaths occur 12 years earlier than would
be expected, so the aggregate annual loss   exceeds  5 million life-years.<Reference refidx="3"/>  These
deaths are primarily due to smoking’s role as a major cause of cancer, cardiovascular diseases,
and chronic lung diseases.  The known adverse health effects also include other respiratory diseases and symptoms, nuclear cataract, hip fractures, reduced female fertility, and diminished health status.  Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with fetal growth restriction, low birth weight, and complications of pregnancy.<Reference refidx="4"/> It has been estimated that about 30% of
cancer deaths and 20% of all premature deaths in the United States are
attributable to smoking.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_14">Tobacco  products are the single, major avoidable cause of cancer, causing more than 
155,000 deaths among smokers in the United States annually due to various
cancers.<Reference refidx="5"/>  The majority of cancers of the lung, trachea, bronchus, larynx,
pharynx, oral cavity, nasal cavity, and esophagus are attributable to tobacco products, particularly cigarettes.  Smoking is also causally associated with cancers of the pancreas, kidney, bladder,   stomach, and
cervix and with myeloid leukemia.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_15">Smoking also has substantial effects on the health of nonsmokers. 
Environmental or secondhand tobacco smoke is implicated in causing lung
cancer and coronary heart disease.<Reference refidx="7"/> Among children, secondhand smoke exposure is causally associated with sudden infant death syndrome, lower respiratory tract illnesses, otitis media, middle ear effusion, exacerbated asthma, and respiratory effects such as cough, wheeze, and dyspnea.<Reference refidx="7"/>  </Para><Para id="_252">Environmental tobacco smoke has the
same components as inhaled mainstream smoke, although in lower absolute
concentrations, between 1% and 10%, depending on the constituent.  Carcinogenic
compounds in tobacco smoke include the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
including the carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and the nicotine-derived
tobacco-specific nitrosamine, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone
(NNK).<Reference refidx="8"/> 
Elevated biomarkers of tobacco exposure, including urinary cotinine,
tobacco-related carcinogen metabolites, and carcinogen-protein adducts, are
seen in passive or secondhand smokers.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_17">In 2013, 20.5% of adult men and 15.3% of adult women in the United States were
current smokers.<Reference refidx="2"/> (<ExternalRef xref="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6347a4.htm">Also available online.</ExternalRef>)      Cigarette smoking is particularly common among  American
Indians and Alaska Natives.  The prevalence of smoking also varies inversely
with education, and was highest among adults who had earned a General Educational Development  diploma (41.4%)  and generally decreased with increasing years of education.<Reference refidx="2"/> (<ExternalRef xref="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6347a4.htm">Also available online.</ExternalRef>)  From 2000 to 2011, significant declines occurred in the use of  cigarettes among middle school (10.7% to 4.3 %) and high school (27.9% to 15.8%) students.<Reference refidx="12"/> (<ExternalRef xref="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a1.htm">Also available online.</ExternalRef>)  Cigarette smoking prevalence among male and
female high school students  increased substantially during the  early 1990s in
all ethnic groups  but appears to have been declining since approximately 1996.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/> (<ExternalRef xref="http://www.monitoringthefuture.org/pubs/monographs/vol1_2001.pdf">Also available online.</ExternalRef>) </Para><Para id="_18">The effect of tobacco use on population-level health outcomes is illustrated
by the example of lung cancer mortality trends.  Smoking by women increased
between 1940 and the early 1960s, resulting in a greater than 600% increase in
female lung cancer mortality since 1950. Lung cancer is now the leading cause
of cancer death in women.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="15"/>    In the last 30 years, prevalence of current
cigarette use has generally decreased, though far more rapidly in males.  Lung
cancer mortality in men peaked in the 1980s, and   has been  declining since then; this
decrease has occurred predominantly in squamous cell and small cell carcinomas,
the histologic types most strongly associated with smoking.<Reference refidx="13"/>  Variations in
lung cancer mortality rates by state also more or less parallel long-standing
state-specific differences in tobacco use.  Among    men, the average
annual age-adjusted lung cancer death rates from 2001 to 2005 were highest in
Kentucky (111.5 per 100,000), where 29.1% of men were current smokers in 1997,
and lowest in Utah (33.7 per 100,000), where only 10.4% of men smoked.  Among
women, lung cancer death rates were highest in Kentucky (55.9 per 100,000), where
28.0% of women were current smokers, and lowest in Utah (16.9 per 100,000),
where only 9.3% of women smoked.<Reference refidx="13"/>

cessation.  Smokers who quit smoking before  age  50 years have up to half the
risk of dying   within 15 years   compared with people who continue to smoke, and the risk
of dying is reduced substantially even among persons who stop smoking after age
70  years.<Reference refidx="1"/>  The risk of lung cancer is 30% to 50% lower than that of continuing
smokers after 10 years of abstinence, and the risk of oral and esophageal
cancer is halved within 5 years of cessation.<Reference refidx="1"/>   Smokers who quit also lower
their risk of cervical, gastric, and bladder cancer.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>
</Para><Para id="_181">In a randomized trial of heavy smokers, the long-term follow-up results demonstrated that compared with the nonintervention group (n = 1,964), those randomly assigned to a smoking cessation intervention (n = 3,923) experienced a 15% reduction in all-cause mortality rates (8.83 vs. 10.38 per 1,000 person-years; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .03).<Reference refidx="4"/> The smoking cessation intervention consisted of a strong physician message plus 12 group sessions and nicotine gum administered during a 10-week period.  Decreases in the risk of lung and other cancers,    and coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease contributed to the  benefit in the group randomly assigned to the smoking cessation intervention.</Para><Para id="_21">A number of approaches at the policy, legislative, and regulatory levels have
been attempted to effect widespread reduction in or prevention of commencement
of   tobacco use.  Various efforts at the community, state, and national level
have been credited with reducing the prevalence of smoking over time.  These
efforts include, reducing minors’ access to tobacco products, disseminating effective
school-based prevention curricula together with media strategies, raising the
cost of tobacco products, using tobacco excise taxes to fund community-level
interventions including mass media, providing proven quitting strategies
through health care organizations, and adopting smoke-free laws and
policies.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>  School-based interventions alone have not demonstrated 
long-term impact for smoking prevention.<Reference refidx="7"/> One of the highest quality studies was a large,   randomized trial
in which children received a theory-based
program that incorporated various social-influence approaches from grade 3 through grade 12, with  no
difference in smoking outcomes observed either at grade 12 or  at 2 years after high school  between school
districts receiving the intervention and those in the control arm.<Reference refidx="8"/>
</Para><Para id="_22">The Community Intervention Trial for Smoking Cessation (COMMIT) was a National Cancer Institute-funded large-scale study to assess a combination of community-based
interventions designed to help smokers cease using tobacco.  COMMIT involved 11
matched pairs of communities in North America, which were randomly assigned to
an arm offering an active community-wide intervention or a control arm (no
active intervention).<Reference refidx="9"/>  The 4-year intervention included messaging through
existing media channels, major community organizations, and social institutions
capable of influencing smoking behavior in large groups of people.  The
interventions were implemented in each community through a local community
board that provided oversight and management of COMMIT activities.
</Para><Para id="_23">In  COMMIT, there was no difference in the mean quit rate
of heavy-smokers in the intervention communities (18.0%) compared with  the
control communities (18.7%).  The light-to-moderate smoker quit rates were
statistically significantly different: averages of 30.6% and 27.5% for the
intervention and control communities, respectively (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .004).  Although no
significant differences in quit rates between the sexes were observed,
less-educated light-to-moderate smokers were more responsive to the
intervention than were college-educated smokers with a light-to-moderate
habit.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/>
</Para><Para id="_24"> Clinical interventions targeted at individuals have shown more promising results.         A   meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials shows that 6-month  cessation rates are significantly improved with use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products compared  with placebo or no intervention (summary relative risk [RR], 1.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50–1.66).<Reference refidx="12"/>  The benefits of nicotine replacement therapy product use have been consistently observed regardless of whether the product used was the patch, gum, nasal spray, inhaler, or lozenge.<Reference refidx="12"/> Smoking cessation counseling alone is  also effective;<Reference refidx="13"/> even a brief
intervention by a health care professional significantly increases the smoking
cessation rate.<Reference refidx="14"/>
</Para><Para id="_244">An important issue is whether pharmacotherapies are more effective in the presence of counseling. A randomized trial compared the following three levels of intervention that combined free pharmacotherapy (nicotine patch or bupropion) with or without counseling: 1) pharmacotherapy alone; 2) pharmacotherapy plus up to two counseling sessions every 6 months; and 3) pharmacotherapy plus up to six counseling sessions every 6 months.  During the 24-month study, each group was offered a randomly assigned intervention at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months later.  For the primary study endpoint of 7-day point prevalence of smoking abstinence after 24 months of follow-up, no statistically significant differences were observed among the interventions.<Reference refidx="15"/> The results of this study suggest that the combination of pharmacotherapy plus counseling is no better than intervention  alone.</Para><Para id="_200">Promoting smoking cessation among cancer survivors is essential because the deleterious health effects of cigarette smoking may impact prognosis in both the short term and long term. In a randomized controlled trial of a peer-delivered smoking cessation intervention among childhood cancer survivors, a significantly higher 12-month quit rate was observed in the intervention group (15% vs. 9%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .01).<Reference refidx="16"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_137"><Title>Tobacco Cessation Guidelines</Title><Para id="_26">In 1996, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), now the Agency
for Healthcare Research and Quality  released a landmark set of clinical
smoking-cessation guidelines for helping nicotine-dependent patients and
healthcare providers.  Now sponsored by the Public Health Service, the updated 2008 guidelines,          "<ExternalRef xref="http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/tobacco/treating_tobacco_use08.pdf">Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence</ExternalRef>"  are available online.<Reference refidx="17"/> The broad elements of these guidelines are:</Para><OrderedList id="_97" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>Clinicians should document the tobacco-use status of every patient.
</ListItem><ListItem>Clinicians should assess the readiness to quit of patients who use           
tobacco and assist those who wish to quit in setting a quit date.
</ListItem><ListItem>Patients using tobacco should be provided with at least one of the
effective brief cessation interventions that are available.
</ListItem><ListItem>In general, more intense interventions are more effective than less
intense interventions in producing long-term tobacco abstinence,

its outcome.

resulting in systematic identification of tobacco users and intervention
with these patients at every visit.</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_42">For individual interventions, the guidelines  <Reference refidx="17"/>  suggest a model based on
outcomes from six major clinical trials of physician-delivered smoking
intervention conducted in the late 1980s:<Reference refidx="18"/> the ASK, ADVISE, ASSESS, ASSIST,
and ARRANGE model.  The physician provides a brief intervention that entails
asking about smoking status at every visit, advising abstinence, assisting by
setting a quit date, providing self-help materials and recommending use of
nicotine replacement therapy, and arranging for a follow-up visit.  See below
for brief and expanded intervention outlines.  The recommendations also
strongly support the value of referral to more intensive counseling.

smoking in the general population.<Reference refidx="19"/>  Since the original AHCPR guidelines <Reference refidx="20"/>
were published in 1996, various nicotine replacement products have been
approved for over-the-counter sale, and additional evidence of the
effectiveness of therapies for smoking cessation has been published.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/> 
Pharmacotherapy of smoking, including nicotine replacement therapies (gum,
patch, spray, lozenge,  and inhaler) and nonnicotine medications  (e.g., bupropion and varenicline) result
in statistically significant increases in smoking cessation rates compared with
a placebo. Based on a synthesis of the results of 110 randomized trials, nicotine replacement therapy treatments, alone or in combination, improve cessation rates over placebos after 6 months (RR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.50–1.66).<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_253">There are also nonnicotine pharmacotherapies that have been efficacious for smoking cessation, including  bupropion and varenicline.  Based on the results of 31 randomized trials that compared the antidepressant bupropion to placebo, after 6 months of follow-up,                 bupropion was associated with a statistically significant increase in the likelihood of quitting smoking (summary odds ratio [OR], 1.94; 95% CI, 1.72–2.19).<Reference refidx="25"/>  There is insufficient evidence to support the idea that combining bupropion plus NRT increases smoking cessation rates compared to NRT alone (summary OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.65–2.91).<Reference refidx="25"/> </Para><Para id="_254">Varenicline is a selective alpha-4-beta-2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist.   In two randomized controlled trials for smoking cessation, varenicline titrated to a dose of 1.0 mg twice a day and  was compared with bupropion sustained-release (SR) 150 mg twice a day and with a placebo group.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/>   Treatment lasted for 12 weeks, with an additional 40 weeks of posttreatment follow-up. In both studies, varenicline was  more efficacious than bupropion and placebo for continuous abstinence from smoking at 9 to 12 weeks and at 9 to   24 weeks of follow-up.  For 9 to 52 weeks of follow-up, varenicline was  more efficacious than placebo in both studies.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/>  At 52 weeks of follow-up, the 7-day point prevalence of smoking abstinence was 46% higher in the varenicline group than in the bupropion SR group (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.04–2.06).<Reference refidx="26"/> The other  study also showed a 46% higher continuous abstinence  in the varenicline group (OR, 1.46; 95% CI,  0.99–2.17).<Reference refidx="27"/> Approximately 30% of the participants who were randomly assigned to receive varenicline reported nausea, more than double that in the bupropion groups, and triple that seen in the placebo groups.                    In a randomized trial comparing varenicline with transdermal nicotine,                            continuous abstinence was greater in the varenicline group than in the transdermal nicotine group at the end of treatment (56% vs. 43%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt;   .001) and during posttreatment follow-up (26% vs.     20%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> =                              .06).<Reference refidx="28"/>   The prevalence of nausea in the varenicline group (37%) was more than triple that in the transdermal nicotine group (10%).</Para><Para id="_255">Based on postmarketing surveillance, on July 1, 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration       (FDA) required additions to the Boxed Warnings for both bupropion and varenicline to describe the risk of serious neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with these products.  Symptoms include: “changes in behavior, hostility, agitation, depressed mood, suicidal thoughts and behavior, and attempted suicide.”<Reference refidx="29"/>   The FDA goes on to advise that the important health benefits of quitting smoking “should be weighed against the small, but real, risk of serious adverse events with the use of varenicline or bupropion.”<Reference refidx="29"/> A meta-analysis of double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials of varenicline administered for at least 1 week (N = 14 trials) indicated that varenicline was associated with an increased risk of serious adverse cardiovascular events (RR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.09–2.71).<Reference refidx="30"/>  This finding is particularly noteworthy because almost all of the randomized trials included in the meta-analysis had the following in common: they excluded patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline; the usual average age of the patient populations (early 40s) was young for CVD; varenicline was usually administered for only 12 weeks or less; and, varenicline is efficacious for smoking cessation, which would act to decrease CVD risk.</Para><Para id="_73">There is a growing number of smoking cessation pharmacotherapies that have been shown to be efficacious in significantly increasing rates of smoking cessation. The choice of therapy should be individualized based on a number
of factors, including past experience, patient and/or physician preference, and
potential agent side effects.
As more is learned about specific genetic variants that influence a smoker's response to smoking cessation pharmacotherapies—such as polymorphisms in genes encoding enzymes involved in nicotine metabolism—this information could eventually be integrated into smoking cessation treatment planning.<Reference refidx="31"/> Presently, the evidence is not yet sufficient to be integrated into clinical practice.</Para><Para id="_74">The following sections summarize available pharmacologic interventions to assist

A meta-analysis of five randomized controlled trials found that smokers who received nortriptyline were 2.4 times more likely (95% CI, 1.7–3.6) than smokers who received a placebo to remain abstinent from smoking after 6 months.<Reference refidx="37"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_211"><Title>Smoking Reduction</Title><Para id="_212">Among dependent smokers, complete abstinence from smoking is the ultimate goal.  Even in instances when complete abstinence from smoking is not achieved, smoking cessation pharmacotherapies may benefit individual health—and ultimately the public’s health—if the smoker reduces the number of cigarettes smoked.  The relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer, and other smoking-associated malignancies, is strongly dose-dependent.  Thus, an individual smoker who is unable to achieve abstinence or who is not motivated to quit smoking may benefit by using pharmacotherapies (or other means) to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked per day.  NRT has thus generated attention as a viable means of “harm reduction.”  In studies that randomly assigned  smokers who were not trying to quit to NRT or placebo, a greater proportion of those randomly assigned to NRT compared with placebo reduced the number of cigarettes per day.<Reference refidx="38"/><Reference refidx="39"/>   However, the impact of NRT on smoking reduction appears not to be sustained in the long run.<Reference refidx="40"/> Less evidence is available for bupropion,    varenicline, and psychosocial interventions as a means of harm reduction.  A potential problem with such a harm reduction strategy would be if it prevented cessation among smokers who would have otherwise quit smoking.  Evidence shows that smoking reduction is actually associated with increased likelihood of future cessation.<Reference refidx="39"/><Reference refidx="41"/> Another potential negative aspect of harm reduction would be if smokers reduced the number of cigarettes smoked per day but modified the way the cigarettes were smoked in such a way that exposure to tobacco toxins was not actually reduced             (e.g., by inhaling more deeply).  Compensatory behaviors such as inhaling more deeply or smoking more of a cigarette are attempts by the smoker to try to maintain nicotine levels, so the use of supplemental NRT presumably safeguards against this.  Evidence from studies of smoking reduction with NRT that measured smoking biomarkers indicates that compensation occurs, but not to such an  extent that it would be expected to outweigh the reduction in exposure from the reduced number of cigarettes per day.<Reference refidx="38"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_290"><Title>A Changing Marketplace for Tobacco Products and Nicotine-Delivery Devices</Title><Para id="_291">The expansion in the marketplace of tobacco products and devices that deliver nicotine poses new challenges to tobacco control.<Reference refidx="42"/><Reference refidx="43"/><Reference refidx="44"/><Reference refidx="45"/><Reference refidx="46"/> Examples of nontraditional tobacco products in the U.S. market include small cigars, water pipe tobacco smoking (“hookah”), and new types of flavored, smokeless tobacco products modeled after Swedish snus.  Prominent among non–tobacco-containing nicotine delivery devices are electronic cigarettes (or “e-cigarettes”) that have experienced a rapid upsurge in use and are now marketed by the major U.S. tobacco companies.<Reference refidx="42"/><Reference refidx="43"/> Monitoring this expansion in products, how the products are used (e.g., product switching, multiple use, and use for tobacco cigarette smoking cessation), and the harms and benefits associated with their use compared to tobacco cigarettes is critical to the development of more effective tobacco control strategies.</Para><Para id="_292">Research to determine the potential risks and benefits of these new products is just beginning to emerge.  In a three-arm trial in New Zealand, 657 adult tobacco cigarette smokers who wanted to quit smoking were all referred to a smoking cessation quit line and randomly assigned to receive nicotine e-cigarettes, nicotine patches, or placebo e-cigarettes.<Reference refidx="47"/> After 3 months of intervention and 3 additional months of follow-up, the primary outcome of 6-month continuous abstinence was 7.3%, 5.8%, and 4.1%, respectively.  These quit rates were low in all three arms of the study, and the differences were not statistically significant but provide preliminary evidence that e-cigarettes resulted in rates of smoking cessation comparable to those of the nicotine patch, a smoking cessation pharmacotherapy of established efficacy.  The trial results also suggested that nicotine e-cigarettes could expand the reach of smoking cessation interventions.  Compared with the group assigned to the nicotine patch, the group assigned to e-cigarettes had higher adherence to treatment (78% vs. 46%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .0001) and were more likely to report that they would recommend their assigned product to a friend wanting to quit (88% vs. 56%; no <Emphasis>P</Emphasis>-value reported).<Reference refidx="47"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: The Health Benefits of Smoking Cessation.
