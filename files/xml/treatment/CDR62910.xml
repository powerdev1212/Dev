The rate of tumor growth varies from very slow to moderately rapid, and some patients may have prolonged survival even after the cancer has metastasized to distant sites, such as bone. The 5-year relative survival rate for men diagnosed in the United States from 2001 to 2007 with local or regional disease was 100%, and  the rate for distant disease was 28.7%; a 99% survival rate was observed for all stages combined.<Reference refidx="2"/>[<ExternalRef xref="http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/prost.html">SEER Stat Fact Sheets: Prostate</ExternalRef>] The approach to treatment is influenced by age and coexisting medical problems. Side effects of various forms of treatment should be considered in selecting appropriate management.</Para><Para id="_2566">Many patients—especially those with localized tumors—may die of other illnesses without ever having suffered disability from the cancer, even if managed conservatively without an attempt at curative therapy.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/>  In part, these favorable outcomes are likely the result of  widespread screening  with the  prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, which can identify patients with  asymptomatic tumors that have little or no lethal potential.<Reference refidx="5"/> There is a large number  of these clinically indolent tumors, estimated from autopsy series of men dying of causes unrelated to prostate cancer to be in the range of 30% to 70% of men older than  60 years.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_2086"> Because diagnostic methods have changed over time, any analysis of survival after treatment of prostate cancer and comparison of the various treatment strategies is complicated by the evidence of increasing diagnosis of nonlethal tumors. Nonrandomized comparisons of treatments may be confounded not only by patient selection factors but also by time trends.</Para><Para id="_2087">For example, a population-based study in Sweden showed that, from 1960 to the late 1980s, before the use of PSA for screening purposes, long-term relative survival rates after the diagnosis of prostate cancer improved substantially as more sensitive methods of diagnosis were introduced. This occurred despite the use of watchful waiting or active surveillance or palliative hormonal treatment as the most common treatment strategies for localized prostate cancer during the entire era (&lt;150 radical prostatectomies per year were performed in Sweden during the late 1980s). The investigators estimated that, if all prostate cancers diagnosed between 1960 and 1964 were of the lethal variety, then at least 33% of cancers diagnosed between 1980 and 1984 were of the nonlethal variety.<Reference refidx="8"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335139">Level of evidence: 3iB</LOERef>]  With the advent of PSA screening as the most common method of detection in the United States, the ability to diagnose nonlethal prostate cancers has further increased.</Para><Para id="_2088">Another issue complicating comparisons of outcomes among nonconcurrent series of patients is the possibility of changes in criteria for the histologic diagnosis of prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="9"/> This phenomenon creates a statistical artifact that can produce a false sense of therapeutic accomplishment and may also lead to more aggressive therapy. </Para><Para id="_2089">Controversy exists regarding the value of screening, the most appropriate staging evaluation, and the optimal treatment of each stage of the disease.<Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/></Para><SummarySection id="_1679"><Title>Incidence and Mortality</Title><Para id="_1680">Estimated new cases and deaths from prostate cancer in the United States in 2015:<Reference refidx="15"/>[<ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/researchandfunding/snapshots/pdf/Prostate-Snapshot.pdf">A Snapshot of Prostate Cancer</ExternalRef>]</Para><ItemizedList id="_1681" Style="bullet">

In the United States, most prostate cancers are diagnosed as a result of screening, either with a PSA blood test or, less frequently, with a  digital rectal examination. Randomized trials have yielded conflicting results.<Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/>  Systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses have reported no clear evidence that screening for  prostate cancer decreases the risk of death from prostate cancer, or that the  benefits outweigh the harms of screening.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/></Para><Para id="_2092">(Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062755" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-screening-pdq">Prostate Cancer Screening</SummaryRef> for a detailed summary of evidence regarding the benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer.)</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1686"><Title>Pathology </Title><Para id="_2567">More than 95% of primary prostate cancers are adenocarcinomas. Prostate adenocarcinomas are frequently multifocal and heterogeneous in patterns of differentiation.  Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia ([PIN] noninvasive atypical epithelial cells within benign appearing acini) is often present in association with prostatic adenocarcinoma. PIN is subdivided into low grade and high grade. The high-grade form may be a precursor for adenocarcinoma.<Reference refidx="21"/></Para><Para id="_1687">  A number of rare tumors account for the remaining few percentages of cases.

The classical score is derived by adding the two most prevalent pattern grades, yielding a score ranging from 2 to 10.  Because there is some evidence that the least-differentiated component of the specimen may provide independent prognostic information, the score is often provided by its separate components (e.g., Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7; or 4 + 3 = 7).<Reference refidx="23"/></Para><Para id="_2098">   There is evidence that, over time, pathologists have tended to award higher Gleason scores to the same histologic patterns, a phenomenon sometimes termed “grade inflation.”<Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/>  This phenomenon complicates comparisons of outcomes in current versus historical patient series. For example, prostate biopsies from a population-based cohort of 1,858 men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1990 through 1992 were re-read in 2002 to 2004.<Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/>  The contemporary Gleason score readings were an average of 0.85 points higher (95% confidence interval, 0.79–0.91; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001) than the same slides read a decade earlier.  As a result, Gleason-score standardized prostate cancer mortality rates for these men were artifactually improved from 2.08 to 1.50 deaths per 100 person years—a 28% decrease even though overall outcomes were unchanged.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_2100"><Title>Molecular markers</Title><Para id="_2569">A number of tumor markers have been reported to be associated with the outcome of prostate cancer patients.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/>  These include: </Para><ItemizedList id="_2570" Style="bullet">

Most urologists now perform a transrectal biopsy using a bioptic gun with ultrasound guidance.  Over the years, there has been a trend toward taking eight to ten or more biopsy samples from several areas of the prostate with a consequent increased yield of cancer detection after an elevated PSA blood test.<Reference refidx="22"/> Less frequently, a transperineal, ultrasound-guided approach can be used in patients who may be at increased risk of complications caused by using a transrectal approach.<Reference refidx="26"/> </Para><Para id="_2103">Prophylactic antibiotics, especially fluoroquinolones, are often used prior to transrectal needle biopsies. There are reports of increasing rates of sepsis, particularly with fluoroquinolone-resistant <Emphasis>E. coli</Emphasis>, and hospitalization after the procedure.<Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/>  Therefore, men undergoing transrectal biopsy should be told to seek medical attention immediately if they experience fever after biopsy.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_35"><Title>Prognostic Factors</Title><Para id="_36">The survival of patients with prostate cancer is related to several factors, including the following:<Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_37" Style="bullet"><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062910#_38" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-treatment-pdq">Extent of tumor</SummaryRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062910#_41" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-treatment-pdq">Histologic grade of tumor</SummaryRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062910#_45" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-treatment-pdq">Patient's age and health</SummaryRef>.</ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062910#_47" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-treatment-pdq">Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level</SummaryRef>.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_2562">(Refer to the <ExternalRef xref="http://seer.cancer.gov/publications/prostate/survival.pdf">Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results'</ExternalRef> 5-year and 10-year survival rates.)</Para><SummarySection id="_38"><Title>Extent of tumor </Title><Para id="_39">When the cancer is confined to the prostate gland, long-term prognosis is excellent.  Patients with locally advanced cancer
are not usually curable, but 5-year survival is still very good.  If prostate
cancer has spread to distant organs, current therapy will not cure it.  Median
survival is usually 1 to 3 years, and most of these  patients will die of
prostate cancer.  Even in this group of patients, indolent clinical
courses lasting for many years may be observed.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_41"><Title>Histologic grade of tumor </Title><Para id="_42">Poorly differentiated tumors are more likely to have metastasized before diagnosis and are associated with a poorer prognosis. The most commonly used method to report tumor differentiation is the Gleason score. (Refer to  the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062910#_1686" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-treatment-pdq">Pathology</SummaryRef> section of the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062910#_1" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-treatment-pdq">General Information About Prostate Cancer</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information.) </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_45"><Title>Patient's age and health </Title><Para id="_46">Any benefits of definitive local therapy with curative intent may take years to emerge.  Therefore, therapy with curative intent is usually reserved for men with a sufficiently long life expectancy.  For example, radical prostatectomy is often reserved for men with an estimated life expectancy of at least 10 years.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_47"><Title>PSA level </Title><Para id="_48">  PSA, an organ-specific marker, is often used as a tumor
marker.<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="34"/><Reference refidx="35"/><Reference refidx="36"/><Reference refidx="37"/><Reference refidx="38"/><Reference refidx="39"/> The higher the level of PSA at baseline, the higher is the risk for metastatic disease or subsequent disease progression. However, it is an imprecise marker of risk.</Para><Para id="_2104">For example, baseline PSA and rate of PSA change were associated with subsequent metastasis or prostate cancer death in a cohort of 267  men with clinically localized prostate cancer who were managed by watchful waiting or active surveillance in the control arm of a randomized trial comparing radical prostatectomy with watchful waiting or active surveillance.<Reference refidx="40"/><Reference refidx="41"/> Nevertheless, the accuracy of classifying men into groups whose cancer remained indolent versus those whose cancer progressed was poor at all examined cut points of PSA or PSA rate of change.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_2105"><Title>Serum acid phosphatase levels</Title><Para id="_2106">Elevations of serum acid phosphatase are associated with poor prognosis in both localized and disseminated disease.

Preoperative nomograms are based on clinical stage, PSA level, Gleason score, and the number of positive and negative prostate biopsy cores.  One independently validated nomogram demonstrated increased accuracy in predicting biochemical recurrence-free survival by including preoperative plasma levels of transforming growth factor B1 and interleukin-6 soluble receptor.<Reference refidx="48"/><Reference refidx="49"/></Para><Para id="_1251">Postoperative nomograms add pathologic findings, such as capsular invasion, surgical margins, seminal vesicle invasion, and lymph node involvement.   The nomograms, however,  were developed at academic centers and may not be as accurate when generalized to nonacademic hospitals, where the majority of patients are treated.<Reference refidx="50"/><Reference refidx="51"/>  In addition, the nomograms use nonhealth (intermediate) outcomes, such as PSA rise or pathologic surgical findings, and subjective endpoints, such as the physician's perceived need for additional therapy.  In addition, the nomograms may be affected by changing methods of diagnosis or neoadjuvant therapy.<Reference refidx="43"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_53"><Title>Follow-up After Treatment </Title><Para id="_916">The optimal follow-up strategy for men treated for prostate cancer is uncertain.  Men should be interviewed and examined for symptoms or signs of recurrent or progressing disease, as well as side effects of therapy that can be managed by changes in therapy.  However, using surrogate endpoints for clinical decision making is controversial, and the evidence that changing therapy based on such endpoints translates into clinical benefit is weak. Often, rates of PSA change are thought to be markers of tumor progression. However, even though a tumor marker or characteristic may be consistently associated with a high risk of prostate cancer progression or death, it may be a very poor predictor and of very limited utility in making therapeutic decisions. </Para><Para id="_2109">Although the PSA test is nearly universally used to follow patients, the diversity of recommendations on the provision of follow-up care reflects the current lack of research evidence on which to base firm conclusions. A systematic review of international guidelines highlights the need for robust primary research to inform future evidence-based models of follow-up care for men with prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="52"/> </Para><Para id="_2110">Preliminary data from a retrospective cohort of 8,669 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated with either radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy suggested that short post-treatment PSA doubling time (&lt;3 months in this study) fulfills some criteria as a surrogate endpoint for all-cause mortality and prostate cancer-specific mortality after surgery or radiation therapy.<Reference refidx="53"/></Para><Para id="_2111">Likewise, a retrospective analysis (<ProtocolRef href="CDR0000067211" nct_id="NCT00004001">SWOG-S9916</ProtocolRef> [NCT00004001]) showed that PSA declines of 20% to 40% (but not 50%) at 3 months and 30% or more at 2 months after initiation of chemotherapy for hormone-independent prostate cancer, and  fulfilled several criteria of surrogacy for overall survival (OS).<Reference refidx="54"/></Para><Para id="_2112">These observations should be independently confirmed in prospective study designs and may not apply to patients treated with hormonal therapy. In addition, there are no standardized criteria of surrogacy or standardized cutpoints for adequacy of surrogate endpoints, even in prospective trials.<Reference refidx="55"/></Para><SummarySection id="_2113"><Title>Follow-up after radical prostatectomy</Title><Para id="_2114">After radical prostatectomy, a detectable PSA level identifies patients at elevated risk of local treatment failure or metastatic disease;<Reference refidx="36"/> however, a substantial proportion of patients with an elevated or rising PSA level after surgery remain clinically free of symptoms for extended periods of time.<Reference refidx="56"/> Biochemical evidence of failure on the basis of elevated or slowly rising PSA alone, therefore, may not be sufficient to initiate additional treatment. </Para><Para id="_2115">For example, in a retrospective analysis of nearly 2,000 men who had undergone radical prostatectomy with curative intent and who were followed for a mean of 5.3 years, 315 men (15%) demonstrated an abnormal PSA of 0.2 ng/ml  or higher, which is considered evidence of biochemical recurrence.  Among these 315 men, 103 (34%) developed clinical evidence of recurrence.  The median time to the development of clinical metastasis after biochemical recurrence was 8 years. After the men developed metastatic disease, the median time to death was an additional 5 years.<Reference refidx="57"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_2116"><Title>Follow-up after radiation therapy</Title><Para id="_2117">For patients treated with radiation therapy, the combination of clinical tumor stage, Gleason score, and pretreatment PSA level is often used to estimate the risk of relapse.<Reference refidx="58"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335142">Level of evidence: 3iDii</LOERef>]  As is the case after prostatectomy, PSA is often followed for signs of tumor recurrence after radiation therapy.  After radiation therapy with curative intent, persistently elevated or rising PSA may be a prognostic factor for clinical disease recurrence; however, reported case series have used a variety of definitions of PSA failure. Criteria have been developed by the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology Consensus Panel.<Reference refidx="59"/><Reference refidx="60"/> It is difficult to base decisions about initiating additional therapy on biochemical failure alone. The implication of the various definitions of PSA failure for OS is not known, and, as in the surgical series, many biochemical relapses (rising PSA only) may not be clinically manifested in patients treated with radiation therapy.<Reference refidx="61"/><Reference refidx="62"/> </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_2118"><Title>Follow-up after hormonal therapy</Title><Para id="_2119">After hormonal therapy, reduction of PSA to undetectable levels provides information regarding the duration of progression-free status; however, decreases in PSA of less than 80% may not be very predictive.<Reference refidx="31"/> Because PSA expression itself is under hormonal control, androgen deprivation therapy can decrease the serum level of PSA independent of tumor response. Clinicians, therefore, cannot rely solely on the serum PSA level to monitor a patient’s response to hormonal therapy; they must also follow clinical criteria.<Reference refidx="63"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_88"><Title>Related Summaries</Title><Para id="_2486">Other PDQ summaries containing information related to prostate cancer include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_89" Style="bullet"><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000299612" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq"> Genetics of Prostate Cancer</SummaryRef> </ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062833" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-prevention-pdq">Prostate Cancer Prevention</SummaryRef></ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062755" url="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-screening-pdq">Prostate Cancer Screening</SummaryRef></ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Howlader N, Noone AM, Krapcho M, et al., eds.: SEER Cancer Statistics Review, 1975-2008.

The general concept of watchful waiting is patient follow-up with the application of palliative care as needed to alleviate symptoms of tumor progression.

For example, TURP or hormonal therapy may be used to alleviate tumor-related urethral obstruction should there be local tumor growth; hormonal therapy or bone radiation might be used to alleviate pain from metastases.
