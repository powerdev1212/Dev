includes the epiglottis, false vocal cords, ventricles, aryepiglottic folds,
and arytenoids.</ListItem><ListItem>The glottis includes the true vocal cords and the anterior and
posterior commissures.</ListItem><ListItem>The subglottic region begins about 1 cm below
the true vocal cords and extends to the lower border of the cricoid cartilage
or the first tracheal ring.
</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_3">The supraglottic area is rich in lymphatic drainage.  After penetrating the
pre-epiglottic space and thyrohyoid membrane, lymphatic drainage is initially
to the jugulodigastric and midjugular nodes.  About 25% to 50% of patients
present with involved lymph nodes.  The precise figure depends on the T stage.  The
true vocal cords are devoid of lymphatics.  As a result, vocal cord cancer
confined to the true cords rarely, if ever, presents with involved lymph nodes. 
Extension above or below the cords may, however, lead to lymph node
involvement.  Primary subglottic cancers, which are quite rare, drain through
the cricothyroid and cricotracheal membranes to the pretracheal, paratracheal,
and inferior jugular nodes, and occasionally to mediastinal nodes.<Reference refidx="2"/>
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_318"><Title>Risk Factors</Title><Para id="_4">A clear association has been made between smoking, excess alcohol ingestion,
and the development of squamous cell cancers of the upper aerodigestive
tract.<Reference refidx="3"/>  For smokers, the risk of the development of laryngeal cancer decreases after the cessation of smoking but remains elevated even years later when compared to that of nonsmokers.<Reference refidx="4"/> If a patient who has had a single cancer continues to smoke and drink
alcoholic beverages, the likelihood of a cure for the initial cancer, by any
modality, is diminished, and the risk of second tumor is enhanced. Because of clinical problems related to smoking and alcohol use in this
population, many patients succumb to intercurrent illness rather than to the
primary cancer. (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062858" url="/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/tobacco/smoking-cessation-hp-pdq">Smoking in Cancer Care</SummaryRef> for more information.)  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_320"><Title>Clinical Features</Title><Para id="_5">Supraglottic cancers typically present with sore throat, painful swallowing,
referred ear pain, change in voice quality, or enlarged neck nodes.  Early
vocal cord cancers are usually detected because of hoarseness.  By the time
they are detected, cancers arising in the subglottic area commonly involve the
vocal cords; thus, symptoms usually relate to contiguous spread.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_321"><Title>Prognostic Factors</Title><Para id="_6">The most important adverse prognostic factors for laryngeal cancers include
increasing T stage and N stage.  Other prognostic factors may include sex, age,
performance status, and a variety of pathologic features of the tumor,
including grade and depth of invasion.<Reference refidx="5"/>
</Para><Para id="_7">Prognosis for small laryngeal cancers that have not spread to lymph nodes is
very good with cure rates of 75% to 95% depending on the site, tumor bulk,<Reference refidx="6"/>
and degree of infiltration.  Although most early lesions can be cured by either
radiation therapy or surgery, radiation therapy may be reasonable to preserve
the voice, leaving surgery for salvage.  Patients with a preradiation
hemoglobin level higher than 13 g/dL have higher local control
and survival rates than patients who are anemic.<Reference refidx="7"/>  </Para><Para id="_8">Locally advanced lesions are treated with combined modality treatment involving radiation and chemotherapy with or without surgery, the aim of which is laryngeal preservation in appropriately selected candidates.<Reference refidx="8"/>  Distant metastases are also common, even if the primary
tumor is controlled.
</Para><Para id="_9">Intermediate lesions have intermediate prognoses, depending on site, T stage,
N stage, and performance status.  Therapy recommendations for patients with
these lesions are based on a variety of complex anatomic, clinical, and social
factors, which should be individualized and discussed in multidisciplinary
consultation (surgery, radiation therapy, and dental and oral surgery) prior to
prescribing therapy.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_333"><Title>Follow-up and Survivorship</Title><Para id="_334">Second
primary tumors, often in the aerodigestive tract, have been reported in as many as 
25% of patients whose initial lesion is controlled.  A study has shown that
daily treatment of these patients with moderate doses of isotretinoin
(i.e., 13-cis-retinoic acid) for 1 year can significantly reduce the incidence of
second tumors.<Reference refidx="9"/>  No survival advantage has been demonstrated, partially because of recurrence and death from the primary malignancy.</Para><Para id="_335">Patients treated for laryngeal cancers are at the highest risk of recurrence in the
first 2 to 3 years.  Recurrences after 5 years are rare and usually represent
new primary malignancies.  Close, regular follow-up is crucial to maximize the
chance for salvage.  Careful clinical examination and repetition of any
abnormal staging study are included in follow-up, along with attention to any
treatment-related toxic effect or complication.

are successfully treated by radiation therapy or surgery alone, including laser
excision surgery.  Radiation therapy may be selected to preserve the voice
and to reserve  surgery for salvaging failures.  The radiation field and dose are
determined by the location and size of the primary tumor.  A variety of
curative surgical procedures are also recommended for laryngeal cancers, some
of which preserve vocal function.  An appropriate surgical procedure must be
considered for each patient, given the anatomic problem, performance status,
and clinical expertise of the treatment team.  Advanced laryngeal cancers are
often treated by combining radiation with concurrent chemotherapy for larynx preservation and total laryngectomy for bulky T4 disease or salvage.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_286">Evaluation of treatment outcome can be reported in various ways:  locoregional
control, disease-free survival, determinate survival, and overall survival (OS) at 2

Outcome should be reported after initial surgery, initial radiation, planned
combined treatment, or surgical salvage of radiation failures.  Primary source
material should be consulted to review these differences.

The evidence is insufficient to show a clear difference in the results  between treatment options in regard to local control or OS. Retrospective data suggests that  in comparison with  surgery, radiation therapy might cause less perturbation of voice quality without a significant difference in patient perception.<Reference refidx="9"/>  </Para><Para id="_324">A direct comparison of chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy versus upfront surgery was made by The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Laryngeal Cancer Study Group in a trial in which 332 patients were  randomly assigned to  three  cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin and fluorouracil) and radiation therapy or surgery and radiation therapy.<Reference refidx="10"/> After two cycles of chemotherapy, the clinical tumor response was complete in 31% of the patients, and there was a partial response in 54% of the patients.

The OS rates were 58% (5 year) and 39% (10 year) for induction chemotherapy, 55% (5 year) and 28% (10 year) for concomitant chemoradiation, and 54% (5 year) and 32% (10 year) for radiation alone. The number of deaths not attributed to larynx cancer or treatment were higher with concomitant chemotherapy (30.8% vs. 20.8% with induction chemotherapy and 16.9% with radiation alone), because after approximately 4.5 years, the survival curves began to separate and favor induction, although the difference was not statistically significant.<Reference refidx="6"/> 
</Para><Para id="_68">The risk of lymph node metastases in patients with stage I glottic cancer
ranges from 0% to 2%, and for more advanced disease, such as stage II and stage
III glottic, the incidence is only 10% and 15%, respectively.  Thus, there is
no need to treat glottic cancer cervical lymph nodes electively in patients
with stage I tumors and small stage II tumors.  Consideration should be given
to using elective neck radiation for larger or supraglottic tumors.<Reference refidx="11"/>
</Para><Para id="_69">For patients with cancer of the subglottis, combined modality therapy is
generally preferred  for the uncommon small lesions (i.e., stage I or stage
