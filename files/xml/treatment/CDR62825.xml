         cancer. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer 
         in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower 
         the number of deaths caused by cancer.</Para><Para id="_31">To prevent new cancers from starting, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044724">scientists</GlossaryTermRef> look at <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045873">risk 
         factors</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000439422">protective factors</GlossaryTermRef>. Anything that increases your 
         chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; 
         anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is 
         called a cancer protective factor.</Para><Para id="_32">Some risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. 
         For example, both smoking and inheriting certain <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045693">genes</GlossaryTermRef> are 
         risk factors for some types of cancer, but only smoking can be 
         avoided. Regular exercise and a healthy <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044660">diet</GlossaryTermRef> may be protective 
         factors for some types of cancer. Avoiding risk factors and 
         increasing protective factors may lower your risk but it does 
         not mean that you will not get cancer.</Para><Para id="_33">Different ways to prevent cancer are being studied, including:</Para><ItemizedList id="_34" Style="bullet">

		  waste product of the body's <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046476">cells</GlossaryTermRef>, as you breathe out.
		  Each lung has sections called <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046188">lobes</GlossaryTermRef>. The

Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women.</Para><Para id="_128">Studies have shown that smoking <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000748245">low tar</GlossaryTermRef>   or low <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000439405">nicotine</GlossaryTermRef> cigarettes does not lower    the risk of lung cancer.   </Para><Para id="_105">Studies also show that the risk of lung cancer from smoking cigarettes increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the number of years smoked. People who smoke have about 20 times the risk of lung cancer compared to those who do not smoke.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_90"><KeyPoint id="_91">Secondhand smoke</KeyPoint><Para id="_92">Being exposed to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000538647">secondhand tobacco smoke</GlossaryTermRef> is also  a risk factor for lung cancer. Secondhand smoke is the smoke that comes from a burning cigarette or other tobacco product, or   that is exhaled by smokers. People who inhale secondhand smoke are exposed to  the same <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef>-causing agents as smokers, although in  smaller amounts. <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044600">Inhaling</GlossaryTermRef> secondhand smoke is called <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000476297">involuntary</GlossaryTermRef> or passive smoking.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_129"><KeyPoint id="_130">Family history</KeyPoint><Para id="_162">Having a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000302456">family history</GlossaryTermRef> of lung cancer is a risk factor for lung cancer. People with a relative who has had lung cancer may be twice as likely to have lung cancer as  people  who do not have a relative who has had lung cancer.  Because cigarette smoking tends to run  in families and  family members are exposed to secondhand smoke,  it is hard to know whether the increased risk of lung cancer is from the family history of lung cancer or from being exposed to cigarette smoke.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_164"><KeyPoint id="_165">HIV infection</KeyPoint><Para id="_166">Being <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045364">infected</GlossaryTermRef> with the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044366">human immunodeficiency virus</GlossaryTermRef> (HIV), the cause of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044365">acquired immunodeficiency syndrome</GlossaryTermRef> (AIDS), is linked with a higher risk of lung cancer. People infected with HIV may have more than twice the risk of lung cancer than those who are not infected. Since smoking rates are higher in those infected with HIV than in those not infected, it is not clear  whether the increased risk of lung cancer   is  from HIV infection or from being exposed to cigarette smoke.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_22"><KeyPoint id="_23">Environmental risk factors </KeyPoint><ItemizedList id="_95" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem><Strong>Radon exposure:</Strong> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046554">Radon</GlossaryTermRef> is a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046550">radioactive</GlossaryTermRef> gas that comes from the breakdown of uranium in rocks and soil. It seeps up through the ground, and leaks into the air or water supply. Radon can enter homes through cracks in floors, walls, or the foundation, and levels of radon can build up in the home.<Para id="_96">Studies show that high levels of radon gas inside homes and other buildings increase the number of new cases of lung cancer  and the number of deaths caused by lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer is higher in smokers exposed to radon than in nonsmokers exposed to radon.

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
