with Down syndrome have an increased risk of developing both ALL and acute myeloid leukemia (AML),<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/> with a cumulative risk of developing leukemia of approximately 2.1% by age 5 years and 2.7% by age 30 years.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/></Para><Para id="_66">Approximately one-half to two-thirds of cases of acute leukemia in children with Down syndrome are ALL, and about 2% to 3% of childhood ALL cases occur in children with Down syndrome.<Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/> While the vast majority of cases of AML in children with Down syndrome occur before the age of 4 years (median age, 1 year),<Reference refidx="20"/> ALL in children with Down syndrome has an age distribution similar to that of ALL in non–Down syndrome children, with a median age of 3 to 4 years.<Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/></Para><Para id="_64">Patients with ALL and Down syndrome have a lower incidence of both favorable (t(12;21) and hyperdiploidy) and unfavorable (t(9;22) or t(4;11) and hypodiploidy) cytogenetic findings and a near absence of T-cell phenotype.<Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/> Approximately 50% to 60% of cases of ALL in children with Down syndrome have genomic alterations affecting <GeneName>CRLF2</GeneName> that generally result in overexpression of this gene.<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/> <GeneName>CRLF2</GeneName> genomic alterations are observed at a much lower frequency (&lt;10%) in children with B-precursor ALL who do not have Down syndrome.<Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/> It does not appear that genomic<GeneName> CRLF2</GeneName> aberrations in patients with Down syndrome and ALL have prognostic relevance.<Reference refidx="23"/>  However,<GeneName> IKZF1</GeneName> gene deletions, observed in up to 35% of patients with Down syndrome and ALL, have been associated with a significantly worse outcome in this group of patients.<Reference refidx="23"/></Para><Para id="_65">Approximately 20% of ALL cases arising in children with Down syndrome have somatically acquired <GeneName>JAK2</GeneName> mutations,<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/> a finding that is uncommon among younger children with ALL but that is observed in a subset of primarily older children and adolescents with high-risk B-precursor ALL.<Reference refidx="30"/> Almost all Down syndrome ALL cases with <GeneName>JAK2</GeneName> mutations also have <GeneName>CRLF2</GeneName> genomic alterations.<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/> Preliminary evidence suggests no correlation between <GeneName>JAK2</GeneName> mutation status and 5-year event-free survival in children with Down syndrome and ALL,<Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="28"/> but more study is needed to address this issue and the prognostic significance of <GeneName>IKZF1</GeneName> gene deletions.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_67"><Title>Inherited genetic polymorphisms </Title><Para id="_68">Genome-wide association studies show that some germline (inherited) genetic polymorphisms are associated with the development of childhood ALL.<Reference refidx="31"/><Reference refidx="32"/> For example, the risk alleles of <GeneName>ARID5B</GeneName> are strongly associated with the development of hyperdiploid B-precursor ALL. <GeneName>ARID5B</GeneName>  is a gene that encodes a transcriptional factor important in embryonic development, cell type–specific gene expression, and cell growth regulation.<Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/></Para><Para id="_1699">In another genome-wide association study in the adolescent and young adult population, unique GATA3 polymorphisms were identified that strongly influence the susceptibility to leukemia in this population.<Reference refidx="35"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1552"><Title>Prenatal origin of childhood ALL</Title><Para id="_1553">Development of ALL is in most cases a multi-step process, with more than one genomic alteration required for frank leukemia to develop. In at least some cases of childhood ALL, the initial genomic alteration appears to occur in utero. Evidence in support of this comes from the observation that the immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor antigen rearrangements that are unique to each patient’s leukemia cells can be detected in blood samples obtained at birth.<Reference refidx="36"/><Reference refidx="37"/> Similarly, in ALL characterized by specific chromosomal abnormalities, some patients appear to have blood cells carrying at least one leukemic genomic abnormality at the time of birth, with additional cooperative genomic changes acquired postnatally.<Reference refidx="36"/><Reference refidx="37"/><Reference refidx="38"/> Genomic studies of identical twins with concordant leukemia further support the prenatal origin of some leukemias.<Reference refidx="36"/><Reference refidx="39"/></Para><Para id="_1554">There is also evidence that some children who never develop ALL are born with very rare blood cells carrying a genomic alteration associated with ALL. For example, in one study, 1% of neonatal blood spots (Guthrie cards) tested positive for the <GeneName>ETV6-RUNX1</GeneName> translocation, far exceeding the number of cases of <GeneName>ETV6-RUNX1</GeneName> ALL in children.<Reference refidx="40"/> Other reports confirm <Reference refidx="41"/> or do not confirm <Reference refidx="42"/><Reference refidx="43"/>  this finding, and methodological issues related to fluorescence <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> hybridization testing complicate interpretation of the initial 1% estimate.<Reference refidx="44"/> Nonetheless, if confirmed, it would support the hypothesis that additional postnatal genomic changes are needed for the development of this type of ALL and that in most cases in which a leukemia-associated alteration is present at birth, the additional leukemogenic genomic changes do not occur and no leukemia develops. </Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_767"><Title>Clinical Presentation</Title><Para id="_768">The typical and atypical symptoms and clinical findings of childhood ALL have been published.<Reference refidx="45"/><Reference refidx="46"/><Reference refidx="47"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_552"><Title>Diagnosis</Title><Para id="_553">The diagnostic evaluation needed to definitively diagnose childhood ALL has been published.<Reference refidx="45"/><Reference refidx="46"/><Reference refidx="47"/><Reference refidx="48"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_19"><Title>Overall Outcome for ALL</Title><Para id="_20">Among children with ALL, more than 95% attain remission, and approximately 80% of patients aged 1 to 18 years with newly diagnosed ALL treated on current regimens are expected to be long-term event-free survivors.<Reference refidx="49"/><Reference refidx="50"/><Reference refidx="51"/><Reference refidx="52"/><Reference refidx="53"/><Reference refidx="54"/></Para><Para id="_21">Despite the treatment advances noted in childhood ALL, numerous important biologic and therapeutic questions remain to be answered before the goal of curing every child with ALL with the least associated toxicity can be achieved. The systematic investigation of these issues requires large clinical trials, and the opportunity to participate in these trials is offered to most patients/families. </Para><Para id="_598">Clinical trials for children and adolescents with ALL are generally designed to compare therapy that is currently accepted as standard with investigational regimens that seek to improve cure rates and/or decrease toxicity. In certain trials in which the cure rate for the patient group is very high, therapy reduction questions may be asked. Much of the progress made in identifying curative therapies for childhood ALL and other childhood cancers has been achieved through investigator-driven discovery and tested in carefully randomized, controlled, multi-institutional clinical trials.

At the completion of a five-drug remission induction regimen (4 weeks from diagnosis), the level of MRD is determined via PCR assay. Patients with high MRD (≥0.001) are classified as very high risk and receive a more intensive postremission consolidation. Patients with low MRD (&lt;0.001) continue to receive treatment based on their initial risk group classification. The goal of this new classification schema is to determine whether intensification of therapy will improve the outcome of patients with high MRD at the end of remission induction. Patients with T-cell ALL are treated as high risk, regardless of MRD status. All patients with <GeneName>MLL</GeneName> translocations or hypodiploidy (&lt;44 chromosomes) are classified as very high risk, regardless of MRD status or phenotype. Ph+ patients are removed from study midinduction and are eligible to enroll on the COG protocol for patients with Ph+ ALL.</Para><Para id="_550"><Strong>SJCRH (Total XVI):</Strong>   Patients are classified into one of three categories (low, standard, or high risk) based on the presenting age, leukocyte count, presence or absence of CNS3 status or testicular leukemia, immunophenotype, cytogenetics and molecular genetics, DNA index, and early response to therapy. Hence, definitive risk assignment (for provisional low-risk or standard-risk cases based on presenting features) will be made after completion of remission induction therapy.
