and health care needs at home.</KeyPoint><Para id="_6">

Many <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef> patients today receive part of their care at home. Hospital stays are shorter than they used to be, and there are now more treatments that don't need an overnight hospital stay or can be given outside of the hospital. People with cancer are living longer and many patients want to be cared for at home as much as possible. This care is often given by  family <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000648947">caregivers</GlossaryTermRef>. 
These caregivers may be spouses, partners, children, relatives, or friends. </Para><Para id="_44">The family caregiver works with the health care team and  has an important role in improving the patient's health and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef>. Today, family caregivers do many things that used to be done in the hospital or doctor's office by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000650566">health care providers</GlossaryTermRef>. Caregiving  includes
 everyday  tasks such as  helping the patient with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000482419">medicines</GlossaryTermRef>, doctor visits, meals, schedules, and health insurance matters. It also includes giving  emotional and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000441265">spiritual</GlossaryTermRef> support, such as  helping the patient deal with feelings and making hard decisions.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_49"><KeyPoint id="_50">It is important that the family caregiver is a part of the team right from the start.  </KeyPoint><Para id="_51">The family caregiver has the very important job of watching for changes in the patient's
medical <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000651193">condition</GlossaryTermRef> while giving long-term care at home. Family caregivers can help plan treatment, make decisions, and carry out treatment plans all through the different parts of treatment.</Para><Para id="_379">This summary is about adult family caregivers in  cancer.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_7"><Title>The Caregiver’s Point of View</Title><SummarySection id="_216"><KeyPoint id="_217">Caregivers need  help and emotional support. </KeyPoint><Para id="_31">A <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000648947">caregiver</GlossaryTermRef> responds in his or her own way to the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef> patient's <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046450">diagnosis</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045849">prognosis</GlossaryTermRef>. The caregiver may feel  emotions that are as strong as or stronger than those felt by the patient. The caregiver’s need for information, help, and support is different from what is needed by the patient. </Para><Para id="_378">The life of a family caregiver changes in many ways when cancer is diagnosed. These changes affect most parts of life and continue after treatment ends.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_218"><KeyPoint id="_219">The caregiver's role changes as   the patient’s needs change during and after cancer treatment.</KeyPoint><Para id="_220">Key times when the caregiver's role changes and new challenges come up are at diagnosis, during treatment at the hospital,  when the patient needs care at home, after treatment ends, and at the patient's end of life.</Para><SummarySection id="_52"><KeyPoint id="_53">At Diagnosis</KeyPoint><Para id="_54">Family caregivers   take an active role that begins when the cancer is being diagnosed. The caregiver has  to learn about the kind of cancer the patient has and new medical terms. The caregiver also goes with the patient to new places for treatment and helps the patient make treatment decisions.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_372"><KeyPoint id="_373">During Treatment at the Hospital</KeyPoint><Para id="_374">The patient may ask the caregiver to be the one to talk to the health care team and make important decisions. The relationship between the caregiver and the patient affects how well this works. Disagreements between the patient and caregiver can make important decisions harder to make and affect treatment choices. In addition to talking to the health care team, the caregiver may also do the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_375" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Take on  many of the patient’s household duties.</ListItem><ListItem>Schedule hospital visits and plan travel to and from the visits.</ListItem><ListItem>Work through the health care system for the patient.</ListItem><ListItem>Arrange for home care.</ListItem><ListItem>Take care of insurance matters.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_376">During the active treatment phase, a caregiver needs to meet the demands of supporting the patient as well as the demands of home, work, and family. This may be physically and emotionally exhausting.

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_58"><KeyPoint id="_59">During Care in the Home</KeyPoint><Para id="_60">When the patient moves from one care setting (such as the hospital) to another (such as the home), it can be <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000450122">stressful</GlossaryTermRef> for   the patient and the caregiver. The patient usually would rather be at home, which is a familiar and comforting place.
The return home usually  means more work for the caregiver. </Para><Para id="_369">In addition to hands-on patient care, the caregiver may also do the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_368" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Be a  companion to the patient.</ListItem><ListItem>Continue doing  many of the patient’s household duties.</ListItem><ListItem>Take care of  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000482419">medicines</GlossaryTermRef> and meals.</ListItem><ListItem>Schedule doctor visits, plan travel to and from the visits, and go with the patient to them.</ListItem><ListItem>Arrange for home visits by therapists or other professionals.</ListItem><ListItem>Deal with medical emergencies.</ListItem><ListItem>Take care of insurance matters.</ListItem><ListItem>Work through the health care system for the patient.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_346"> Caregivers  worry about how they'll be able to do all this and also take care of themselves. The caregiver sometimes has to give up social activities and miss work. This can all be very hard and very tiring in a physical and emotional way for both the caregiver and the patient. These demands can be especially hard on older caregivers.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_64"><KeyPoint id="_65">After Treatment Ends</KeyPoint><Para id="_66">Some patients and caregivers expect life to go back to the way it was before the cancer was diagnosed and this may not happen. Caregiver stress may continue after the patient's treatment ends, as roles change once again.  Some  caregivers have problems adjusting  for the first  year after the end of treatment. Part of this is caused by worry  that the cancer will come back.  When the caregiver is the partner or spouse of the cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000450125">survivor</GlossaryTermRef>, there may be sexual problems, also. Studies have shown that these adjustment problems usually do not last long. Problems with adjusting that can  last a long time include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_223" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Problems in the relationship between the caregiver and the patient.</ListItem><ListItem>Poor communication between the caregiver and the patient.</ListItem><ListItem>Lack of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000440116">social support</GlossaryTermRef>.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_32"><KeyPoint id="_8">At the End of Life</KeyPoint><Para id="_224">Caring for a patient at home at the end of life  brings a new set of challenges for the caregiver. The patient depends even more on the caregiver for physical and emotional support. The patient's  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045022">symptoms</GlossaryTermRef> also may be more difficult to manage. The caregiver may feel distressed by these new challenges and by not being able to take part in activities and interests that are important to him or her. The caregiver may feel even more distressed if the patient goes into <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044182">hospice</GlossaryTermRef> care.  Studies have shown that caregivers have a lower <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef> and poorer health when giving the patient end-of-life care than they do during active treatment.   </Para><Para id="_225">Some hospital or hospice programs offer end-of-life support services to improve the patient's quality of life and help both the caregiver and the patient. End-of-life support services  include the following:

In addition to hands-on care, the caregiver may also do the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_245" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Manage the patient's medical care, insurance claims, and bill payments.</ListItem><ListItem>Be a companion to the patient.</ListItem><ListItem>

</KeyPoint><Para id="_87">Doctors,
caregivers, and patients are partners in  making decisions.  Making a decision involves getting the right information in a way that it can be understood. Cancer patients have many information needs. They want to know about staying healthy, tests and treatments, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046580">side effects</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045022">symptoms</GlossaryTermRef>, and emotional issues. </Para><Para id="_271">In order to make treatment decisions, caregivers and patients often want more information and they may look for help and information from sources other than the doctor.    It's common for patients and their families to do the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_163" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Use the Internet to search for more information on the patient’s cancer and its treatment. 
</ListItem><ListItem>Check on the information given by the doctor. 
</ListItem><ListItem>Look into  other treatments or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044951">complementary</GlossaryTermRef> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044921">alternative medicine</GlossaryTermRef>. 
</ListItem><ListItem>Ask for advice from family and friends. </ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_270"> Information  from outside sources is sometimes wrong   or may  be different from what the doctor said. It's important to get  information that can be trusted and to talk to the doctor about it.  
 

Most libraries can help people find articles about cancer in medical journals and cancer information written for patients and the public. Good places to get information include government agencies, cancer centers,  and cancer organizations.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_88"><KeyPoint id="_89">Advocate</KeyPoint><Para id="_261">The family caregiver  knows and understands the needs of the patient. The caregiver becomes an advocate for the patient by giving this information to the health care team. Although a caregiver may not have a medical background, daily contact with the patient gives the caregiver  important information that helps the health care team help the patient. Information about the patient's symptoms and problems can  help the doctor make better treatment plans and improve the  patient's chance of  getting better. </Para><Para id="_262">As the patient's advocate, the family caregiver may do the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_165" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Talk with the health care team about the patient's needs and wishes for the patient.</ListItem><ListItem>Get information that may be hard to find. 
</ListItem><ListItem>Find  doctors and specialists needed.</ListItem><ListItem>Watch the patient for changes and problems.</ListItem><ListItem>Help the patient  follow treatments.</ListItem><ListItem>Tell the health care team about any new symptoms or side effects and ask for help to treat them.</ListItem><ListItem>Help the patient make healthy changes and follow healthy behaviors.</ListItem><ListItem>Pay the patient's bills and take care of insurance claims.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_91"><KeyPoint id="_92">Communicator</KeyPoint><Para id="_370">Good communication between the doctor, patient, and caregiver can improve the patient’s health
and medical care.  The family caregiver will often take on the role of speaking  for the patient while keeping the  patient included
in decision making. Good communication helps both the doctor and the caregiver get the information they need to  support the patient. Doctors need to  hear about  patients' concerns and caregivers need to understand the disease and treatment options. Poor communication may cause confusion about treatment. This can affect choices made about treatment and the patient's chance of getting better.</Para><Para id="_264">Cultural differences between the doctors and the caregiver or patient can affect communication. In some cultures, it is the custom to keep a life-threatening <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046450">diagnosis</GlossaryTermRef> a secret from the patient and avoid talking about the disease. Sometimes it is left to the caregiver to tell the patient the truth about a serious or  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044178">terminal illness</GlossaryTermRef>. This can be <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000450122">stressful</GlossaryTermRef> for caregivers and increase their feelings of loneliness and responsibility. Caregivers should tell the health care team if they think cultural beliefs may affect how they talk about the cancer and making treatment decisions.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_22"><Title>The Caregiver’s Quality of Life</Title><SummarySection id="_275"><KeyPoint id="_276">Caring for a patient with cancer affects the family caregiver's quality of life.</KeyPoint><Para id="_37">Family <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000648947">caregivers</GlossaryTermRef> usually begin caregiving without training  and are expected to meet  many demands without much help.  A caregiver often neglects his or her own <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef> by putting the patient's needs first.  Today, many <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000650566">health care providers</GlossaryTermRef>   watch for signs of caregiver <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454701">distress</GlossaryTermRef> during the course of the patient's <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef> treatment. When caregiver strain affects the quality of caregiving, the patient's well-being is also affected. Helping the caregiver also helps the patient.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_277"><KeyPoint id="_278">Caregiving can affect the caregiver's quality of life in many areas. </KeyPoint><Para id="_279">The caregiver's well-being is affected in many areas. These include <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454766">psychological</GlossaryTermRef>, physical, social, financial, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000441265">spiritual</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para><SummarySection id="_347"><KeyPoint id="_348">Psychological Issues</KeyPoint><Para id="_349">Psychological distress is the most common effect of caregiving on the caregiver's quality of life. Caring for a cancer patient is a difficult and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000450122">stressful</GlossaryTermRef> job. Caregiver distress comes from the practical demands of the caregiver role as well the emotional ones, such as seeing the patient suffer. Family members seeing a loved one with cancer may feel as much or more distress than the patient does. Distress is usually worse when the cancer is advanced and the patient is no longer being treated to  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000318813">cure</GlossaryTermRef> the cancer.</Para><Para id="_350"> 

Caregivers who have health problems of their own or demands from other parts of their lives may enter the caregiving role already overwhelmed. For an older adult caregiver, problems that are a part of aging may make caregiving harder to handle.</Para><Para id="_351"> 

The caregiver's ability to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454700">cope</GlossaryTermRef> with distress may be affected by his or her personality type. Someone who is usually hopeful and positive may cope better with problems of caregiving. 

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_100"><KeyPoint id="_101">Physical Issues</KeyPoint><Para id="_266">Cancer patients often need a lot of physical help during their illness. This is physically demanding for the caregiver, who may need to help the patient with many activities during the day such as:  </Para><ItemizedList id="_267" Style="bullet"><ListItem> Use the toilet.</ListItem><ListItem>Eat.  </ListItem><ListItem>Change position in bed.</ListItem><ListItem>Move from one place to another, such as from bed to toilet.</ListItem><ListItem>Use medical equipment. </ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_102">The amount of  physical help a patient needs depends on the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_170" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Whether the patient can do normal <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000430401">activities of daily living</GlossaryTermRef>, like dressing and walking. 
</ListItem><ListItem>The amount of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000321374">fatigue</GlossaryTermRef> the patient has.</ListItem><ListItem>The <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045885">stage</GlossaryTermRef> of the cancer.

Healthy habits such as exercise, a healthy <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044660">diet</GlossaryTermRef>, and regular medical checkups may be pushed to the side. Health problems the caregiver already has may become worse, or they may have new health problems. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_103"><KeyPoint id="_104">Social Issues</KeyPoint><Para id="_105">Caregivers often have  less time to spend with friends and in the community  as their days are filled with caring for the cancer patient.  If there are problems in the relationship between the caregiver and the patient, the caregiver may feel even more alone. </Para><Para id="_172">In the beginning, there may be  a lot of support from friends. The caregiver may be  able to continue working and keep up work relationships. When cancer care continues for a long time, the caregiver may need to stop working and friends may call or visit less often. As caregivers         struggle to meet the ongoing demands of caregiving, they  may want more help from family and friends. Caregivers can find support in other places, such as caregiver groups and cancer organizations, where they can talk with other families. Some caregivers find it helpful to join a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045917">support group</GlossaryTermRef> or talk to a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000688836">counselor</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044716">psychologist</GlossaryTermRef>, or other <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000441253">mental health</GlossaryTermRef> professional. Others also find it helpful to turn to a leader in their faith or spiritual community.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_106"><KeyPoint id="_107">Money Issues</KeyPoint><Para id="_108">There are many financial costs of cancer. Families must pay insurance deductibles, copayments, and for services that are not covered by insurance, such as transportation and home care help. Some caregivers give up their jobs and income so they can stay home with the patient, which makes it harder to pay for everything.</Para><Para id="_377">Caregivers who work may have less distress if they are able to take leave from work under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). FMLA applies to businesses with at least 50 employees. It allows employees to take time off from work for their own illness or a relative's serious medical <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000651193">condition</GlossaryTermRef> without losing their jobs or benefits. Caregivers may take up to 12 weeks of leave.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_112"><KeyPoint id="_113">Spiritual Issues</KeyPoint><Para id="_284">Feelings of spiritual well-being may help lower the caregiver's stress. Keeping faith and finding meaning and hope have been shown to decrease the effect of caregiving stress on mental health. Spiritual well-being may help some caregivers be more hopeful, find meaning in the cancer experience, and be more accepting of what is.

Some feel it is natural to care for someone they love. Sometimes there are practical reasons, such as no insurance or  money to pay for other help. 

Whatever the reasons, giving care and support during cancer isn't easy, yet many caregivers find  something positive from it.</Para><Para id="_288">Caring for a person with cancer causes many caregivers to look at life in new ways. They think about the purpose of life and they often focus on what they value most.

For some caregivers, looking for meaning is a way to cope.
</Para><Para id="_290">Some caregivers will have the following rewards:</Para><ItemizedList id="_179" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Find  they can be strong during bad times.</ListItem><ListItem>Have a better sense of self-worth or personal growth.

everyday life,  recognize the many jobs done by the caregiver, and look for signs of caregiver strain. Caregiver strain occurs when caregivers are not comfortable in their roles or feel they cannot handle everything they need to do. Caregiver strain may lead to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000430479">depression</GlossaryTermRef> and general <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454766">psychological</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454701">distress</GlossaryTermRef>. If the caregiver feels too much strain,    caregiving is no longer healthy for either the caregiver or the patient. </Para><Para id="_356">A caregiver assessment should look at not only what the patient needs the caregiver to do, but also what the caregiver is willing and able to do. Caregiver strain may occur when the family caregiver does not have the knowledge needed to care for the patient. The health care team can support the caregiver in this area.</Para><Para id="_352">Family caregivers report many problems with their caregiving experiences. Assessment is done to find out what the problems are, in order to give the caregiver the right kind of support. Support services can help the caregiver stay healthy, learn caregiving skills, and remain in the caregiving role, all of which help the patient as well. 

</Para><Para id="_186">Some of the factors that affect   caregiver strain:</Para><ItemizedList id="_294" Style="bullet"><ListItem>The number of hours spent caregiving.</ListItem><ListItem>How prepared the caregiver is for caregiving.</ListItem><ListItem>The types of care being given.</ListItem><ListItem>How much the patient is able to do without help (such as bathing and dressing).</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_295"><KeyPoint id="_296">Caregiver well-being is assessed in several areas to find out what type of help is needed.</KeyPoint><Para id="_297"> There is no standard tool for caregiver assessment.

As they try to meet the demands of caregiving, older caregivers may not take care of their own health. This can make their health worse or cause new health problems.

For example,  caregivers who have a job and also care for children report high levels of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000450122">stress</GlossaryTermRef>. However, working while caregiving can also be helpful. Time away from the caregiving role and the social support  from co-workers can give the caregiver some relief.   </Para><Para id="_303">Roles and relationships among family members can be affected by caregiving.

It's important for  caregivers to ask for help when they need it. Many people who were once caregivers say they did too much on their own. Some wished that they had asked for help sooner.  The best time to find out where to get help is when the patient is <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046450">diagnosed</GlossaryTermRef> with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef>. All through caregiving,  it’s important to watch for signs of caregiver strain and get help right away.
 Caregivers who take care of their own needs have  the strength to carry on and be a better caregiver. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_312"><KeyPoint id="_313">Support services can be chosen to help where the caregiver needs it.</KeyPoint><Para id="_314">Support for the caregiver may include education and information, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000450097">coping skills</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000450098">counseling</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000450116">psychotherapy</GlossaryTermRef>, family meetings, home care help, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044182">hospice</GlossaryTermRef> care.

Most family caregivers know little about pain and how to manage it. For pain to be controlled well, the patient needs to receive the pain medicines as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044711">prescribed</GlossaryTermRef> by the doctor. A caregiver's knowledge and beliefs about pain medicine may affect the patient's pain relief.  A caregiver who is afraid the patient will become addicted or take an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000450114">overdose</GlossaryTermRef> may  give the patient too little pain medicine. When the caregiver knows the facts about pain medicines and the right way to use them, the patient is more likely to have better pain control. The caregiver can talk to a doctor who is expert in treating pain and get the information and emotional help he or she needs to control the patient's pain.</Para><Para id="_327">Caregivers may need  to learn the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_197" Style="dash"><ListItem>What medicines to use and how and when to give them.</ListItem><ListItem>How to tell if a medicine is working and common side effects of the medicine.

These programs give information, improve caregiving  skills,  and help caregivers feel in control and more hopeful.
Some programs train on one topic, such as teaching the caregiver how to solve problems or manage patient symptoms, like pain. Other programs train the caregiver in several areas of caregiving, and these types of programs may help   caregivers    feel better overall. Talk to  a member of your health care team or call your local hospital to see if these programs are offered in your area.</Para><Para id="_334">One program called <ExternalRef xref="http://www.apa.org/pi/about/publications/caregivers/practice-settings/intervention/cope.aspx">COPE</ExternalRef> (which stands for Creativity, Optimism, Planning, and Expert information) trains caregivers in how to solve difficult caregiving problems, make plans for their individual situations, and feel more positive. This program has been shown to decrease stress in some caregivers. </Para><Para id="_335">The Family Caregiver Cancer Education Program teaches caregivers  how to manage symptoms, communicate better, manage roles, relationships, and  finances, and take care of themselves. Caregivers have more confidence and feel  they learned useful  information  after taking this  program. Over time, they report feeling healthier.</Para><Para id="_336">Training in specific skills helps improve <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef> for many caregivers. Programs that offer caregiver training by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000269445">nurses</GlossaryTermRef> who visit the home have worked very well.  These nurses prepare patients and caregivers for changes in the level of care, teach them communication skills, visit patients at home, and make sure  care continues all  through the different phases of treatment.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_136"><KeyPoint id="_137">Counseling </KeyPoint><Para id="_138">Counseling  helps caregivers deal with the emotions that come with the demands of caregiving. The health care team can  recommend <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045917">support groups</GlossaryTermRef> or refer caregivers to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000441253">mental health</GlossaryTermRef> professionals.
This kind of support may lessen anxiety and depression and help the caregiver feel more positive, more able to cope, and that they have control over the situation. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_357"><KeyPoint id="_358">Family Meetings</KeyPoint><Para id="_359">
When taking care of a cancer patient, family members need to work together. There may be problems and conflicts in some families, and the stress of caring for a relative with cancer can bring up old issues or make new ones. These conflicts may cause communication problems within the family and with the health care team. When there are conflicts like this, it may help to have family meetings with the health care team.</Para><Para id="_360"> 
During a family meeting, the whole family talks with the health care team. Family meetings help the health care team and the caregivers connect and work together. It is important to include the family spokesperson and all caregivers. While everyone may be trying to do what they think is best for the patient, family members may disagree about what this means. During family meetings, family members can talk about how they feel or decide what kind of help they can give. Each person may have certain skills to offer. Family meetings may also help with the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_361" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>	Identify caregivers' concerns.</ListItem><ListItem>Give clear information about treatment.</ListItem><ListItem>Make it easier to make decisions about treatment choices and about care at the end of life.</ListItem><ListItem>Make sure the caregivers know that symptoms and side effects will be controlled.</ListItem><ListItem>Make sure that caregivers know that the wishes of the patient are being considered.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_362">

Hospice Care for the Cancer Patient</KeyPoint><Para id="_345">Hospice care is given to patients who are near the end of life and are no longer being treated to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000318813">cure</GlossaryTermRef> or control their cancer. The goal of hospice is to help patients live each day to the fullest by making them comfortable and relieving their symptoms.
Family caregivers may need more training and advice to feel comfortable doing what’s needed to care for the patient during the final <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045885">stages</GlossaryTermRef> of cancer. The family caregiver often feels as much emotional <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454701">distress</GlossaryTermRef> as the patient does during this time. 
 A hospice care team helps with the emotional, social, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000441265">spiritual</GlossaryTermRef> needs of patients, caregivers, and families.

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_AboutThis_10"><Title>Clinical Trial Information</Title><Para id="_AboutThis_11">A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
