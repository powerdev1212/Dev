For this reason, mistletoe has been classified as a type of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045616">biological response modifier</GlossaryTermRef> (a substance that stimulates the body's response to infection and disease).

Laboratory studies have suggested that mistletoe may  support the immune system 

 by increasing the number and activity of various types of white blood cells.  One type of European mistletoe (IscadorQu) used in a 2004 laboratory study showed a strong anticancer effect on certain types of cancer cells but no anticancer effect on  other types of cancer cells. While one laboratory  study reported that mistletoe extract caused several types of human cancer cells to grow faster, this was not found in other recent lab studies. </Para></Answer><Answer><Para id="_20">Studies testing mistletoe's ability to stop cancer cell growth in animals have yielded mixed and inconsistent results,  depending on the extract used, the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044664">dose</GlossaryTermRef> tested, the way it was given, and the type of cancer studied.   Results of a few animal studies have suggested that mistletoe may be useful in decreasing the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046580">side effects</GlossaryTermRef> of  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044930">standard</GlossaryTermRef> anticancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044737">therapy</GlossaryTermRef>, such as chemotherapy and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044971">radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef>, and that it counteracts the effects of drugs used to suppress       the immune system, such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045186">cortisone</GlossaryTermRef>.  </Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_21"><Question>Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) been conducted using
mistletoe?
</Question><Answer><Para id="_22">Most <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045961">clinical trials</GlossaryTermRef>   using mistletoe to treat cancer have been done in Europe. Most study results have been published in German. Although many  of these trials have reported mistletoe to be effective, there are  major weaknesses in almost all  that raise doubts about their findings. Weaknesses have included small numbers of patients,  incomplete patient data, lack of information about mistletoe dose, and problems with study design. 
</Para><Para id="_48">Many studies involve using mistletoe as   <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045587">adjuvant therapy</GlossaryTermRef> in patients with cancer. One <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000286525">retrospective cohort study</GlossaryTermRef> done in Europe between 1993 and 2000 looked at the use of a mistletoe extract (Iscador)  as long-term adjuvant therapy in  800 patients  treated with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000444983">colorectal cancer</GlossaryTermRef> that had not spread. The study found that patients treated with Iscador had fewer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000444960">adverse events</GlossaryTermRef>, better symptom relief, and improved <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044023">disease-free survival</GlossaryTermRef> compared to patients who did not receive Iscador as adjuvant therapy.</Para><Para id="_57">A European study published in 2013 looked at the use of IscadorQu in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000478743">advanced</GlossaryTermRef> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044058">metastatic</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044521">pancreatic cancer</GlossaryTermRef>.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of 3 treatments: (1) Iscador injections; (2)  Polyerga Neu injections (a sheep <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046593">spleen</GlossaryTermRef> preparation said to stimulate the immune system and have <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000446109">antitumor</GlossaryTermRef> effects); or (3) <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046688">placebo</GlossaryTermRef> injections of a vitamin B mixture. Results in 312 patients showed no differences among the 3 groups in survival or tumor <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044085">response</GlossaryTermRef>.

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_2"><Title>General CAM Information</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_3">Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also referred to as integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_4">Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_5">Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. </Para></SummarySection> 
  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_6"><Title>Evaluation of CAM Approaches</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_7">It is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute  and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_8">Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH)  in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.</Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_9"><ExternalRef xref="http://cam.cancer.gov/cam/best_case_intro.html">The NCI Best Case Series Program</ExternalRef>   which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.</Para></SummarySection>
