cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team
of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during
childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the primary care physician, pediatric surgical subspecialists, radiation
oncologists, pediatric oncologists/hematologists, rehabilitation specialists,
pediatric nurse specialists, social workers, and others to ensure that
children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation that will
achieve optimal survival and quality of life.  Refer to the PDQ <ExternalRef xref="http://cancer.gov/cancerinfo/pdq/supportivecare/">Supportive and Palliative Care</ExternalRef> summaries for specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer.</Para><Para id="_74">Guidelines for pediatric cancer
centers and their role in the treatment of pediatric patients with cancer have
been outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics.<Reference refidx="2"/>  At these pediatric
cancer centers, clinical trials are available for most  types of cancer
that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity to participate in
these trials is offered to most patients/families.  Clinical trials for
children and adolescents with cancer are generally designed to compare
potentially better therapy with therapy that is currently accepted as standard. 
Most of the progress made in identifying curative therapies for
childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.  Information about
ongoing clinical trials is available from the <ExternalRef xref="http://cancer.gov/clinicaltrials">NCI
 Web site</ExternalRef>.
</Para><Para id="_88">Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer.<Reference refidx="3"/> Between 1975 and 2010, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.<Reference refidx="3"/> For Ewing sarcoma, the 5-year survival rate has increased over the same time from 59% to 78% for children younger than 15 years and from 20% to 60% for adolescents aged 15 to 19 years.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close follow-up because cancer therapy side effects may persist or develop months or years after treatment.  Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000343584" url="/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-hp-pdq">Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer</SummaryRef>  for specific information about the incidence, type, and monitoring of late effects in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors.</Para><SummarySection id="_153"><Title>Origin and Incidence of Ewing Sarcoma </Title><Para id="_187">Studies using immunohistochemical markers,<Reference refidx="4"/> cytogenetics,<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/> molecular genetics, and tissue culture <Reference refidx="7"/> indicate that Ewing sarcoma is derived from a primordial bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cell.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/>  Older terms such as primitive neuroectodermal tumor, Askin tumor (Ewing sarcoma of chest wall), and extraosseous Ewing sarcoma  (often combined in the term <Emphasis>Ewing sarcoma family of tumors</Emphasis>) refer to this same tumor. 
</Para><Para id="_319">The incidence of Ewing sarcoma  is approximately three cases per 1 million  per year and has remained  unchanged for 30 years.<Reference refidx="10"/> Data from the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries report an overall incidence of Ewing sarcoma of one case per 1 million in the U.S. population. The incidence in patients aged 10 to 19 years  is between nine and ten cases per 1 million. The same analysis suggests that the incidence of Ewing sarcoma in the United States is nine times greater in Caucasians than in African Americans.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_125">The median age of patients with  Ewing sarcoma is 15 years, and more than 50% of patients are adolescents. Well-characterized cases of Ewing sarcoma in neonates and infants have been described.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/> Based on data from 1,426 patients entered on European Intergroup Cooperative Ewing Sarcoma Studies (EI-CESS),  59% of patients are male and 41% are female.

commonly referred to as small, round, blue-cell tumors of childhood.  The individual cells of Ewing sarcoma contain round-to-oval nuclei with fine dispersed chromatin without nucleoli. Occasionally, cells with smaller, more hyperchromatic, and probably degenerative nuclei are present, giving a light cell/dark cell pattern. The cytoplasm varies in amount, but in the classic case, it is clear and contains glycogen, which can be highlighted with a periodic acid-Schiff stain. The tumor cells are tightly packed and grow in a diffuse pattern without evidence of structural organization.

Acute renal toxicity was lower in the VAC arm than in the VAI arm, but long-term renal function outcome and fertility analyses are still pending. Three-year EFS for this low-risk population was 77%. It is difficult to compare this outcome with that of other large series because the study population excluded patients with poor response to initial therapy or patients with tumors more than 200 mL in volume who received local-control therapy with radiation alone.

Randomized trials that directly compare both modalities do not exist, and their relative roles remain controversial.  Although retrospective institutional series suggest superior local control and survival with surgery rather than radiation therapy, most of these studies are compromised by selection bias.

doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide, also known as VAdriaC or VDC, alternating with ifosfamide and
etoposide (IE).<Reference refidx="9"/>  The combination of IE has shown activity in Ewing sarcoma, and a large randomized clinical trial and a nonrandomized trial demonstrated that outcome was improved when IE was alternated with VAdriaC.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/>    Dactinomycin is no longer used in the United States but continues to be used in the Euro-Ewing studies. Increased dose intensity of doxorubicin during the initial months of therapy was associated with an improved outcome in a meta-analysis performed before the standard use of ifosfamide and etoposide.<Reference refidx="11"/>    
  The use of
high-dose VAdriaC has shown promising results in small numbers of patients.<Reference refidx="11"/> A single institution study of 44 patients treated with high-dose VAdriaC and IE had an 82% 4-year  EFS.<Reference refidx="12"/>   However, in an intergroup trial of the Pediatric Oncology Group and the Children's Cancer Group, which compared a dose-intensified chemotherapy regimen of vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and etoposide (VDC/IE) with standard doses of the same regimen, no differences in outcome were observed.<Reference refidx="13"/> Unlike the single institution trial, this trial did not maintain the dose intensity of alkylating agents for the duration of treatment.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_217">In a completed Children's Oncology Group (COG) trial (<ProtocolRef href="CDR0000068323" nct_id="NCT00006734">COG-AEWS0031</ProtocolRef>), 568  patients with newly diagnosed localized extradural Ewing sarcoma were randomly assigned to receive chemotherapy (VAdriaC alternating with IE) given every 2 weeks (interval compression) versus every 3 weeks (standard).
Patients randomly assigned to the every 2-week interval of treatment had an improved 5-year EFS (73% vs. 65%, <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .048). There was no increase in toxicity observed with the every 2-week schedule.<Reference refidx="14"/> </Para><Para id="_37">Local control can be achieved by surgery and/or radiation.  Surgery is
generally the preferred approach if the lesion is resectable.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/>  The
superiority of resection for local control has never been tested in a
prospective randomized trial.  The apparent superiority may represent selection
bias.  In past studies, smaller more peripheral tumors were more likely to be
treated by surgery, and larger, more central tumors were more likely to be
treated by radiation therapy.<Reference refidx="17"/> An Italian retrospective study showed that surgery improved outcome only in extremity tumors, although the number of patients with central axis Ewing sarcoma who achieve adequate margins is small.<Reference refidx="8"/> In a series of 39 patients treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, who received both surgery and radiation, the 8-year local failure rate was 5% for patients with negative surgical margins and 17% for those with positive margins.<Reference refidx="5"/> Data for patients with pelvic primary Ewing sarcoma from a North American intergroup trial showed no difference in local control or survival based on local-control modality—surgery alone, radiation therapy alone, or radiation plus surgery.<Reference refidx="18"/>  </Para><Para id="_320">If a very young child has Ewing sarcoma, surgery
may be a less morbid therapy than radiation therapy because of the retardation
of bone growth caused by radiation.  Another potential benefit for surgical
resection of the primary tumor is information concerning the amount of necrosis
in the resected tumor.  Patients with residual viable tumor in the resected
specimen have a worse outcome than those with complete necrosis.  In a
French Ewing study (EW88), EFS for patients with less than 5%
viable tumor, 5% to 30% viable tumor, and more than 30% viable tumor was
75%, 48%, and 20%, respectively.<Reference refidx="17"/>  European investigators are
studying whether treatment intensification (i.e., high-dose chemotherapy with
stem cell rescue) will improve outcome for patients with a poor
histologic response.  Radiation therapy should be employed for patients who do
not have a surgical option that preserves function and should be used for
patients whose tumors have been excised but with inadequate margins.
 Pathologic fracture at the time of diagnosis does not preclude surgical resection and is not associated with adverse outcome.<Reference refidx="19"/></Para><Para id="_38">Radiation therapy should be delivered in a setting in which stringent planning
techniques are applied by those experienced in the treatment of  Ewing sarcoma.  Such an approach will result in local control of the tumor with
acceptable morbidity in most patients.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="20"/>  The radiation dose may
be adjusted depending on the extent of residual disease after the initial surgical
procedure.  Radiation therapy is  generally administered in fractionated doses totaling approximately  55.8 Gy to the
prechemotherapy tumor  volume.  A randomized study of 40 patients with Ewing sarcoma using
 55.8 Gy to the prechemotherapy tumor extent with a 2 cm margin compared with the
same total-tumor dose after  39.6 Gy to the entire bone showed no
difference in local control or EFS.<Reference refidx="3"/> Hyperfractionated
radiation therapy   has not been associated with improved local control  or decreased morbidity.<Reference refidx="1"/>   </Para><Para id="_318">Comparison of proton-beam radiation therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment plans has shown that proton-beam radiation therapy can spare more normal tissue adjacent to Ewing sarcoma primary tumors than IMRT.<Reference refidx="21"/> Follow-up remains relatively short, and there are no data available to determine if the reduction in dose to adjacent tissue will result in improved functional outcome or reduce the risk of secondary malignancy. Because patient numbers are small and follow-up is relatively short, it is not possible to determine if the risk of local recurrence might be increased by reducing radiation dose in tissue adjacent to the primary tumor.</Para><Para id="_75"> Higher rates of local failure are seen in patients older than 14 years who have tumors more than 8 cm in length.<Reference refidx="22"/> A retrospective analysis of patients with   Ewing sarcoma of the chest wall compared patients who received hemithorax radiation therapy with those who received radiation therapy to the chest wall only.  Patients with pleural invasion, pleural effusion, or intraoperative contamination were assigned to hemithorax radiation therapy.  EFS is longer for patients who received hemithorax radiation, but the difference was not statistically significant.  In addition, most patients with primary vertebral tumors did not receive hemithorax radiation and had a lower probability for EFS.<Reference refidx="23"/></Para><Para id="_39">For patients with residual disease after an attempt at surgical resection, the Intergroup Ewing Sarcoma Study (INT-0091) recommends 45 Gy to the original disease site plus a 10.8 Gy boost for patients with gross residual disease and 45 Gy plus a  5.4 Gy
boost for patients with microscopic residual disease.  No radiation therapy is recommended for those who have no evidence of 
microscopic residual disease following surgical resection.  </Para><Para id="_69">Radiation therapy is associated with the development of second malignant neoplasms.  A retrospective
study noted that those patients who received  60 Gy or more had an incidence
of second malignancy of 20%.  Those who received  48 Gy to  60 Gy had an
incidence of 5%, and those who received less than  48 Gy did not develop a

The most common error is the comparison of this high-risk group with an inappropriate control group. Patients with Ewing sarcoma at high risk of treatment failure who received high-dose therapy are compared with patients who did not receive high-dose therapy. Patients who undergo high-dose therapy must respond to systemic therapy, remain alive and respond to treatment long enough to reach the time at which stem cell therapy can be applied, be free of comorbid toxicity that precludes high-dose therapy, and have an adequate stem cell collection. Patients who undergo high-dose therapy and stem cell support are a highly selected group; comparing this patient group with all patients with high-risk Ewing sarcoma is inappropriate and leads to the erroneous conclusion that this strategy improves outcome.
