When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044678">injected</GlossaryTermRef> into a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000476471">vein</GlossaryTermRef> or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000301626">systemic chemotherapy</GlossaryTermRef>).  When chemotherapy is placed directly into the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046483">cerebrospinal fluid</GlossaryTermRef> (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046681">intrathecal chemotherapy</GlossaryTermRef>), an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000257523">organ</GlossaryTermRef>, or a body <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463703">cavity</GlossaryTermRef> such as the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045070">abdomen</GlossaryTermRef>, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046559">regional chemotherapy</GlossaryTermRef>). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type  of  cancer being treated. Primary CNS lymphoma may be treated with intrathecal chemotherapy and/or   <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046144">intraventricular</GlossaryTermRef> chemotherapy, in which anticancer drugs are placed into the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045939">ventricles</GlossaryTermRef> (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044669">fluid</GlossaryTermRef>-filled cavities) of the brain. <MediaLink ref="CDR0000539773" type="image/jpeg" alt="Intrathecal chemotherapy; drawing shows the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain and spinal cord, and an Ommaya reservoir (a dome-shaped container that is placed under the scalp during surgery; it holds the drugs as they flow through a small tube into the brain).

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
