Brain tumors are classified according to histology, but tumor location and extent of spread are important factors that affect treatment and prognosis. </Para><Para id="_136">Craniopharyngiomas are uncommon pediatric brain tumors. They are believed to be congenital in origin, arising from ectodermal remnants, Rathke cleft, or other embryonal epithelium, and often occur in the suprasellar region with an intrasellar portion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) imaging are used to diagnose craniopharyngiomas, but histologic confirmation is generally required before treatment. The treatment of newly diagnosed craniopharyngiomas may include a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and/or cyst drainage. The treatment of recurrent craniopharyngiomas depends on the initial treatment used. The 5-year and 10-year survival rates, regardless of treatment given, are higher than 90%.</Para><SummarySection id="_40"><Title> Incidence </Title><Para id="_41">Craniopharyngiomas are relatively uncommon, accounting for about 6% of all intracranial tumors in children.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>  </Para><Para id="_138">No predisposing factors have been identified.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_139"><Title>Anatomy</Title><Para id="_140"><MediaLink ref="CDR0000748659" type="image/jpeg" alt="Drawing of the inside of the brain showing  the lateral ventricle, third ventricle, and fourth ventricle, cerebrum, choroid plexus, hypothalamus, pineal gland, pituitary gland, optic nerve, tentorium, cerebellum,  brain stem, pons, medulla, and spinal cord." language="en" thumb="Yes" id="_135"><Caption language="en">Anatomy of the inside of the brain, showing the pineal and pituitary glands, optic nerve, ventricles (with cerebrospinal fluid shown in blue), and other parts of the brain.
