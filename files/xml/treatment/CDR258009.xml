         cancer. By preventing cancer, the number of new cases of cancer 
         in a group or population is lowered. Hopefully, this will lower 
         the number of deaths caused by cancer.</Para><Para id="_2">To prevent new cancers from starting, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044724">scientists</GlossaryTermRef> look at <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045873">risk

         chance of developing cancer is called a cancer risk factor; 
         anything that decreases your chance of developing cancer is 
         called a cancer protective factor.</Para><Para id="_3">Some risk factors for cancer can be avoided, but many cannot. 
         For example, both smoking and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045098">inheriting</GlossaryTermRef> certain <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045693">genes</GlossaryTermRef> are

It helps the body develop and maintain female sex characteristics. Estrogen can affect the growth
			 of some <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancers</GlossaryTermRef>, including <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000444987">endometrial cancer</GlossaryTermRef>. A woman's risk of developing

			 <ListItem>Estrogen-only <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046127">hormone replacement therapy</GlossaryTermRef>:  Estrogen  may be given to replace the estrogen no longer produced by the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046687">ovaries</GlossaryTermRef> in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045269">postmenopausal</GlossaryTermRef> women or  women whose   ovaries have been removed. This is called hormone replacement therapy (HRT), or hormone therapy (HT). The use of hormone replacement

				of  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000349455">endometrial hyperplasia</GlossaryTermRef> in postmenopausal women.  Endometrial hyperplasia is an abnormal thickening of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046108">endometrium</GlossaryTermRef> (lining of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046645">uterus</GlossaryTermRef>). It is not cancer, but in some cases, it may lead to endometrial cancer.  For this reason, estrogen therapy alone is usually <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044711">prescribed</GlossaryTermRef> only for women who do not have a uterus. <Para id="_82">When estrogen is combined with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000304743">progestin</GlossaryTermRef> (another hormone), it is called combination estrogen-progestin replacement therapy.

During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
