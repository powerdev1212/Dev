Burzynski, MD, PhD.  Chemically, antineoplastons are a mixture of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000446104">amino acid</GlossaryTermRef>
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044022">derivatives</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045823">peptides</GlossaryTermRef>, and amino acids found in human <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000270735">blood</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046642">urine</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> The developer originally isolated antineoplastons from human blood and later found the same peptides in urine.  Urine was subsequently used because it was less expensive and easier to obtain. Since 1980, antineoplastons have been synthesized from commercially available chemicals at the Burzynski Research Institute.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_12">According to the developer, antineoplastons are part of a biochemical <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000496506">surveillance</GlossaryTermRef> system in the body and work as “molecular switches.”  For the developer, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046477">cell differentiation</GlossaryTermRef> is the key to cancer therapy.  At the molecular level, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044636">abnormal</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046476">cells</GlossaryTermRef> that are potential cancer cells need to be “switched” to normal mode.  Antineoplastons are the surveillance system that directs cancer cells into normal channels of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046445">differentiation</GlossaryTermRef>.  According to statements published by the developer, people with cancer lack this surveillance system because they do not have an adequate supply of antineoplastons.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_13">The notion of controlling <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumor</GlossaryTermRef> growth through a naturally occurring biochemical mechanism in the body that directs cancer cells into normal channels of differentiation is one of the theoretical foundations of antineoplaston therapy.  In a complex <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046250">organism</GlossaryTermRef> like the body, cells are continuously differentiating. Groups of abnormal cells can arise under the influence of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046486">carcinogenic</GlossaryTermRef> factors from outside or inside the body.  The body must have a mechanism for dealing with these abnormal cells, or the organism will not live very long.  The proposed components in the body that correct the differentiation problems of abnormal cells and send them into normal pathways have been given the name “antineoplastons” by the developer.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_14">The developer defines antineoplastons as “substances produced by the living organism that protect it against development of neoplastic growth by a nonimmunological process which does not significantly inhibit the growth of normal <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissues</GlossaryTermRef>.”<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_15">The developer originally <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044209">hypothesized</GlossaryTermRef> the existence of antineoplastons by applying the cybernetic theory of information exchange in autonomous systems to the study of peptides in the blood.<Reference refidx="2"/>  The living cell is an autonomous cybernetic system connected to, and receiving, information from its environment through an energy pathway and an information pathway.  It was postulated that a regulator within such a system would control the transfer of information and the expenditure of energy.  Peptides were considered the information carriers in the body.    Hypothesizing that peptides were the carriers of differentiation information to the cells, the developed began looking for peptides in the blood of cancer patients that might correct abnormal differentiation.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_16">To begin the search for antineoplastons, the developer used human blood, separating and removing the peptides found there.  Later it was discovered that the same peptide fractions existed in human urine.  Each peptide fraction was tested <Emphasis><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045733">in vitro</GlossaryTermRef></Emphasis> against various normal and neoplastic <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044016">cell lines</GlossaryTermRef> to gauge its effect on <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045671">DNA</GlossaryTermRef> synthesis and growth.  The fractions that had little or no inhibitory effect on normal cells but a substantial inhibitory effect on neoplastic cell lines were separated into two classes: those that were effective against a specific cell line and those that were active against a broad array of neoplastic cell lines.   Those with a broad spectrum of activity were grouped together and called “antineoplaston A.”   Peptide fractions with specific <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044816">antineoplastic</GlossaryTermRef> activity were not investigated further.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_17">Antineoplaston A was further purified and yielded antineoplastons A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. These mixtures of 7 to 13 peptides were patented in 1985.<Reference refidx="6"/>  <Emphasis>In vitro</Emphasis> tissue <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000476357">culture</GlossaryTermRef> studies and <Emphasis><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046352">in vivo</GlossaryTermRef></Emphasis> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000445093">toxicity</GlossaryTermRef> studies in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043996">animal models</GlossaryTermRef> were performed for antineoplastons A1 through A5. According to the developer, each individual fraction had a higher level of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000446109">antitumor</GlossaryTermRef> activity and lower toxicity level than antineoplaston A.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_18"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045830">Phase I trials </GlossaryTermRef> of this antineoplaston group in patients with various <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000478743">advanced

selected for further study.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_19">The active <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000422394">compound</GlossaryTermRef> in A2 was found to be 3-phenylacetylamino-2,6-piperinedione, which was named antineoplaston A10.<Reference refidx="7"/> From antineoplaston A10, three other compounds have been derived:

Although some articles attempt to demonstrate that antineoplastons (specifically, antineoplaston A10) can bind to DNA at certain sites, this is an extrapolation from three-dimensional molecular models of DNA and A10 and does not demonstrate that this binding actually occurs.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/></Para><Para id="_25">Other criticism focuses on the form of antineoplastons.  Although the active fraction, antineoplaston A10, is insoluble in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043998">aqueous</GlossaryTermRef> solutions, the developer has stated that it is present in body <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044669">fluids</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_26">Antineoplastons AS2-5 and AS2-1 are derived from A10.  Antineoplaston AS2-5 is PAG, and AS2-1 is a 4:1 mixture of PA and PAG.  Because it is a strong acid, PA would exhibit <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044020">cytotoxicity</GlossaryTermRef> <Emphasis>in vitro</Emphasis> if in high enough <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000683342">concentration</GlossaryTermRef> and not neutralized.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_27">The active component of antineoplaston A10 is 3-phenylacetylamino-2,6-piperidinedione.  Reagents necessary for the synthesis of this antineoplaston compound are readily available internationally from any chemical supply company.<Reference refidx="24"/> The developer retains patents on antineoplaston compounds and their use when administered pharmaceutically to inhibit the growth of neoplastic cells.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="25"/></Para><Para id="_28">To conduct <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044168">clinical</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000348921">drug</GlossaryTermRef> research in the United States, researchers must file an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000446561">Investigational New Drug</GlossaryTermRef> (IND) application with the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454785">U.S. Food and Drug Administration </GlossaryTermRef> (FDA).  The FDA’s IND process is confidential, and the existence of an IND application can be disclosed only by an applicant.</Para><Para id="_29">There are currently several active <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045961">clinical trials</GlossaryTermRef> sponsored and administered by the developer of antineoplastons.  Information on these trials can be accessed through the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials">NCI Web site</ExternalRef>. None of these trials are <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045858">randomized </GlossaryTermRef><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044014">controlled trials</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para><Para id="_30">Although several possible mechanisms of action and theories about the activity of antineoplastons have been proposed, specifically for antineoplaston A10, none of the theories has been conclusively demonstrated.</Para><Para id="_31">One theoretical mechanism of action proposes that antineoplaston A10 is specifically capable of intercalating with DNA at specific base pairs and thereby might interfere with carcinogens binding to the DNA helix.  This interweaving of A10 into the DNA helix may be capable of interfering with DNA replication, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000390290">transcription</GlossaryTermRef>, or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460221">translation</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="23"/> The theory is based on the manipulation of molecular models of DNA and A10; however, no published evidence of the creation of this actual <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045065">molecule</GlossaryTermRef> or evidence of the properties ascribed to it exists in the medical literature.</Para><Para id="_32">Another theoretical mechanism of action is based on the structural similarities of antineoplaston A10 to other experimental anticancer drugs such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045976">carmustine</GlossaryTermRef> and 5-cinnamoyl-6-aminouracil.  A10 has been proposed to bind to chromatin and therefore relate to other anticancer drugs such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045140">doxorubicin</GlossaryTermRef> that interact directly with DNA.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/></Para><Para id="_33">At the cellular level, two other mechanisms of action have been proposed to explain inhibition of tumor growth. One theory involves the activity of PAG, a component of some antineoplastons.  PAG appears to compete with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045446">glutamine</GlossaryTermRef> for access to the glutamine <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046294">membrane</GlossaryTermRef> transporter and may inhibit the incorporation of glutamine into the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046092">proteins</GlossaryTermRef> of neoplastic cells.  Because glutamine is essential for the cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase where DNA replication occurs, antineoplastons may arrest cell cycle <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044078">progression</GlossaryTermRef> and stop cell division.<Reference refidx="28"/>  Another theory proposes that phenylacetic acid, also a component of several antineoplastons, inhibits methylation of nucleic acids in cancer cells.  The hypomethylation of DNA in cancer cells may lead to terminal differentiation and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000439419">prevention</GlossaryTermRef> of tumor growth or progression.<Reference refidx="28"/> In one <Emphasis>in vitro</Emphasis> study, human <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044237">colon cancer</GlossaryTermRef> cells were exposed to antineoplaston AS2-1 at high concentration and reported to normalize hypermethylation status at the promoter region of various <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046657">tumor suppressor genes</GlossaryTermRef> that are silenced in colon cancer.<Reference refidx="29"/> However, this effect was noted at an AS2-1 concentration of 2 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044213">mg</GlossaryTermRef>/<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044214">mL</GlossaryTermRef>, which is approximately four times higher than the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000285973">mean</GlossaryTermRef> steady state concentration previously reported in cancer patients treated with AS2-1,<Reference refidx="20"/> and thus the clinical relevance of these findings is questionable.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="1013179">Burzynski SR: Antineoplastons: biochemical defense against cancer.

The search for information-bearing <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045823">peptides</GlossaryTermRef> in body <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044669">fluids</GlossaryTermRef> led him to separate peptides from human <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000270735">blood</GlossaryTermRef> and subsequently from human <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046642">urine</GlossaryTermRef>.
