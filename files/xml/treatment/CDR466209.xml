            complementary and alternative treatment for cancer?
</Question><Answer><Para id="_35">The vegetable and herb mixture now called Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup was developed to treat cancer.</Para><ItemizedList id="_20" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>In the mid-1980's, the developer created the mixture to treat a relative who was <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046450">diagnosed</GlossaryTermRef> with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045144">stage IV non-small cell lung cancer</GlossaryTermRef> and not helped by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044930">standard treatment</GlossaryTermRef>.  The mixture contained shiitake mushroom, mung bean, and the herbs <ScientificName>Hedyotis diffusa</ScientificName> and barbat skullcap. The developer believed  these ingredients contain substances that may block the growth of  cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046476">cells</GlossaryTermRef>  and/or help the body's <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356">immune system</GlossaryTermRef> attack cancer cells. The relative was reported to be alive and free of cancer more than 13 years later. Three more patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000478743">advanced cancer</GlossaryTermRef>  were treated with a combination of shiitake mushroom and mung bean. These patients were also reported to benefit from the treatment.</ListItem><ListItem>In 1992, the developer applied for a patent for Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup as an herbal treatment of cancer. The developer reported on <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454774">animal studies</GlossaryTermRef> done in mice (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000466209#_8" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/suns-soup-pdq">Question 5</SummaryRef>). The developer then  began doing <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045961">clinical trials</GlossaryTermRef> (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000466209#_9" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/suns-soup-pdq">Question 6</SummaryRef>) to test Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup in cancer patients. </ListItem><ListItem>In 1995, the developer was awarded a patent for Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_36">Many of the vegetables and herbs in Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup were chosen because previous research and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449722">traditional Chinese medicine</GlossaryTermRef> suggest they contain anticancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044709">phytochemicals</GlossaryTermRef> (substances found in plants that may have effects on the body). These include substances such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045977">protease inhibitors</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044161">plant sterols</GlossaryTermRef>, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046660">isoflavones</GlossaryTermRef>. These ingredients may block the growth of  cancer cells  and/or improve the way the body's immune system attacks cancer cells.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_6"><Question>What is the theory behind the claim that Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup is useful in treating cancer?</Question><Answer><Para id="_24">The theory is that certain ingredients in Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup may contain phytochemicals that have significant anticancer effects in humans. One of these ingredients  is shiitake mushroom. <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044157">Lentinan</GlossaryTermRef>, which is taken from shiitake mushroom, has been used in Japan to treat  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000445087">stomach</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044237">colon cancer</GlossaryTermRef> after <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045570">surgery</GlossaryTermRef>. Treatment with lentinan is reported to help patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000445087">stomach cancer</GlossaryTermRef> live longer and have a better <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef>. Lentinan may not be easily absorbed by the body from food, so it is usually given by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044678">injection</GlossaryTermRef>. Other substances in shiitake mushroom that are more easily used by the body from food have shown anticancer activity in animal tests.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_7"><Question>How is Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup administered?</Question><Answer><Para id="_25">Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup is eaten as part of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044660">diet</GlossaryTermRef>. Daily <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044664">doses</GlossaryTermRef> of either 1 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000330174">ounce</GlossaryTermRef> of the DSV (mixed with water or other soup) or 10 ounces of the FSV were used in clinical trials.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_8"><Question>Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies  been conducted using    
	Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup?</Question><Answer><Para id="_26">Few <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044517">preclinical studies</GlossaryTermRef> have been done with Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup. Research in a laboratory or using animals is done to find out if a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000348921">drug</GlossaryTermRef>, procedure, or treatment is likely to be useful in humans. Preclinical studies are done before clinical trials (in humans) are begun.  </Para><Para id="_27">A small number of mice were injected with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumor</GlossaryTermRef> cells and fed either standard food or food mixed with one or more ingredients from Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup.  The researchers reported that the growth of tumors was slower in the mice that were fed the Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup ingredients, compared to the mice that ate standard food. The tumor growth was slowest when the mice were fed both mung bean and shiitake mushroom.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_9"><Question>Have any  clinical trials (research studies with people) of Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup been conducted?</Question><Answer><Para id="_28">Clinical trials using Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup to treat cancer have been done with small numbers of patients. These patients received other types of treatment, either before or during treatment with Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup, and different vegetable mixtures were used in the different studies.</Para><Para id="_29">The results of these trials were compared with published information on similar patients who did not receive Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup. Most patients receiving the vegetable mixtures lived longer, were better able to carry out their daily activities, and either gained weight or did not lose weight.  In some patients who ate Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup, tumor growth slowed or the tumor completely went away. Because patients in these trials received other treatments, it is not known if their <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044085">responses</GlossaryTermRef> were caused by Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup, the other treatments, or both.  None of the trials were <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045858">randomized</GlossaryTermRef> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044014">controlled</GlossaryTermRef>. Randomized clinical trials give the highest level of evidence. In randomized trials, volunteers are put randomly (by chance) into one of 2 or more groups that compare different treatments. In  a controlled  trial, one group (called the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044149">control group</GlossaryTermRef>) does not receive the new treatment being studied. The control group is then compared to the groups that receive the new treatment, to see if the new treatment works. Randomized controlled trials, enrolling larger numbers of people, are needed to confirm the results of studies done so far on Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup. </Para><Para id="_34">One randomized clinical trial (<ProtocolRef href="CDR0000455021" nct_id="NCT00246727">NCT00246727</ProtocolRef>) of patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045367">stage IIIB</GlossaryTermRef> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045144">stage IV non-small cell lung cancer</GlossaryTermRef> is now being conducted. The trial is comparing the survival of patients receiving Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup with patients receiving a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046688">placebo</GlossaryTermRef> (inactive substance). Both groups are receiving  treatment with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046609">supportive care</GlossaryTermRef>, such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044971">radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef>, surgery, or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000269448">palliative care</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_10"><Question>Have any side effects or risks been reported from Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup?</Question><Answer><Para id="_31"> No harmful <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046580">side effects</GlossaryTermRef> or risks have been reported in the use of Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup. Some patients felt full or bloated after eating the dry form, but patients who ate the frozen mixture did not report this.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_11"><Question>Is Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States?</Question><Answer><Para id="_32">The <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454786">FDA</GlossaryTermRef> has not  approved any form of Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup for the treatment of cancer or any other medical condition. Well-designed clinical trials that test identical mixtures of vegetables and herbs are needed to prove whether Selected Vegetables/Sun’s Soup is useful in treating cancer.

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_2"><Title>General CAM Information</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_3">Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also referred to as integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_4">Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_5">Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. </Para></SummarySection> 
  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_6"><Title>Evaluation of CAM Approaches</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_7">It is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute  and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_8">Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH)  in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.</Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_9"><ExternalRef xref="http://cam.cancer.gov/cam/best_case_intro.html">The NCI Best Case Series Program</ExternalRef>   which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.</Para></SummarySection>
