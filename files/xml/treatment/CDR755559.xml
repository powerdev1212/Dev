Oncology clinicians are obligated to explore, with the patient and family, the potential impact of continued disease-directed treatments or care directed at the patient’s symptoms and QOL.</Para><Para id="_8">This section summarizes the information that will allow oncology clinicians and patients with advanced cancer to create a plan of care to improve QOL at the end of life (EOL) by making informed choices about the potential harms of continued aggressive treatment and the potential benefits of palliative or hospice care.

One group of researchers proposed that patients value five main domains of care near the EOL:<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_16" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Receiving adequate pain and symptom management.</ListItem><ListItem>Avoiding inappropriate prolongation of dying.</ListItem><ListItem>Achieving a sense of control.</ListItem><ListItem>Relieving burden.</ListItem><ListItem> Strengthening relationships with loved ones.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_17">A 2011 prospective study of QOL in a cohort of patients with advanced cancer seen in outpatient medical oncology clinics provides additional insight into the patient’s perspective of what contributes to a good QOL in advanced cancer.<Reference refidx="3"/> The median survival of the cohort was 10 months, so the results may not reflect the situation for patients closer to death. Nonetheless, the strongest predictors of QOL were age, good performance status, and a survival time longer than 6 months. Patients who were waiting for a new treatment had worse emotional well-being. This experience suggests that QOL is related to factors such as disease progression and its complications, and to patients’ goals relative to any treatment they are receiving. In addition, other researchers have reported that family caregivers often report worse scores than do patients with advanced cancer in self-assessments of the patients’ QOL.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_18"><Title>Indicators of EOL care quality</Title><Para id="_19">A variety of indicators have been proposed to measure the quality of EOL care in patients with advanced cancer. Several salient criticisms of the proposed indicators include the following:</Para><OrderedList id="_20" Style="Arabic" Compact="No">
     <ListItem> Indicators are typically measured in a period before death that is defined retrospectively from death. Clinicians cannot predict whether an intervention will be futile in preventing death; consequently, quality concerns may be exaggerated if the indicator is dependent on the time to death.</ListItem><ListItem>Quality indicators may be insensitive to patient preferences. For example, a patient may prefer to receive chemotherapy close to death and forgo hospice enrollment. Conversely, the failure to deliver treatments consistent with guidelines may reflect patient refusals or medical contraindications to the recommended treatment. One study <Reference refidx="5"/> demonstrated that adherence to six quality indicators in patients with lung cancer cared for in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) was compromised by refusal (0% to 14% of the time) or medical contraindications (1% to 30% of the time), depending on the indicator.</ListItem><ListItem>Administrative databases do not capture data for all patients. For example, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services databases capture only the Medicare population.</ListItem><ListItem>Many indicators were not deliberately developed as measures of quality and may be insensitive to important outcomes.</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_21"> Nonetheless, important insights into quality EOL care are provided by studying indicators over time or between different geographic regions, health systems, or subspecialties.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_22"><Title>Trends over time in indicators of EOL care quality</Title><Para id="_23">Multiple reports are relevant to understanding trends in EOL care quality indicators over time for a variety of cancers. The following observations are supported by a 2004 analysis,<Reference refidx="6"/> with additional supporting citations indicated when relevant:</Para><ItemizedList id="_24" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Increasing numbers of patients start a new chemotherapy regimen within 30 days of death or continue to receive chemotherapy within 14 days of death.</ListItem><ListItem>Increasing numbers of patients are referred to hospice; however, the length of stay in hospice remains relatively brief, supporting the concern that referrals to hospice may occur too late. For example, a 2011 study of men dying from prostate cancer demonstrated an increased utilization of hospice (approximately 32% to 60%), but there was an increase in the proportion of stays shorter than 7 days.<Reference refidx="7"/></ListItem><ListItem>The rates of utilization of ICU stays have also increased. For example, one study <Reference refidx="8"/> reported that for patients dying from pancreatic cancer, admissions to ICUs  increased in two different time periods: from 1992 to 1994, ICU admissions increased from 15.5% to 19.6%; and from 2004 to 2006, ICU admissions increased from 8.1% to 16.4%.</ListItem><ListItem>Rates of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders have increased but remain close to death: A 2008 study of the rate and timing of DNR orders at a major cancer center between the years 2000 and 2005 demonstrated that the rates of DNR at the time of death increased from 83% to 86% for in-hospital deaths and from 28% to 52% for out-of-hospital deaths.<Reference refidx="9"/> However, for inpatient deaths, the median time between signing the DNR and death was 0 days; for outpatient deaths, it was 30 days. This suggests that communication about resuscitation preferences is delayed. This delay may negatively affect patient preparation for the EOL.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_25"><Title>Regional variations in indicators of EOL care quality</Title><Para id="_26">Regional variations in rates of utilization of health care resources near the EOL are of interest because the differences are rarely associated with improved outcomes. While initial findings focused on differences between geographic regions of the United States, subsequent studies have demonstrated potentially meaningful differences between or within health systems.<Reference refidx="10"/> A brief summary of some notable variations follows.</Para><ItemizedList id="_27" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>	Compared with men enrolled in a fee-for-service Medicare product, older men with advanced cancer who received treatment through the VHA were less likely to receive chemotherapy within 14 days of death (4.6% vs. 7.5%), less likely to spend time in an ICU within 30 days of death (12.5% vs. 19.7%), and less likely to visit the emergency department more than once (13.1% vs. 14.7%).<Reference refidx="11"/></ListItem><ListItem>An analysis of data by the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy &amp; Clinical Practice about the care of Medicare patients with poor prognoses demonstrated significant regional variations in EOL care.<Reference refidx="12"/> The principal findings include the following:<ItemizedList id="_28" Style="dash"><ListItem>Variations in the rate of hospitalizations, ICU stays, and aggressive interventions such as CPR and mechanical ventilation.</ListItem><ListItem>Variations in the use of chemotherapy in the last 14 days of life.</ListItem><ListItem>Variations in the use of hospice measured as rates of referral or lengths of stay.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_150">In the opinion of the authors, the observed regional variations were too large to be accounted for by racial or ethnic preferences or illness levels. Factors correlated with the aggressiveness of EOL care include the availability of resources such as the supply of ICU beds or imaging equipment; the number of doctors involved in each patient’s care; and the treatment setting itself.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para></ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_29"><Title>Factors associated with variations in EOL care</Title><Para id="_30">Availability of medical specialists, numbers of hospital beds, physician, and health system characteristics are well-established factors associated with increased expenditures in the final 6 months of life. A 2011 study <Reference refidx="13"/> utilized data from decedents enrolled in the Health and Retirement Study, Medicare, and the Dartmouth Atlas to identify patient-level factors that may contribute to regional variations. Functional status decline, Hispanic ethnicity, black race, and chronic diseases such as diabetes were associated with higher expenditures, even after controlling for regional characteristics. The patient-level factors accounted for only 10% of variations. EOL practice patterns and number of hospital beds per capita were also associated with higher expenditures. Advance care planning did not influence expenditures.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para><Para id="_332">A potential explanation for regional variations in EOL care is regional variations in patient preferences. The evidence, however, is conflicting.</Para><ItemizedList id="_333" Style="bullet" Compact="No">
     <ListItem>One study surveyed 2,515 Medicare beneficiaries about their general preferences for medical care in the event of a serious life-limiting illness with a life expectancy of less than 1 year.<Reference refidx="14"/>
 The preferences were correlated with EOL spending by hospital referral region. There were no differences between preferences for palliation or life prolongation by region. Thus, it is unlikely that regional variations in preferences account for observed variation in EOL spending.</ListItem><ListItem>Conversely, a secondary analysis of the potential influence of treatment site on the Coping with Cancer study outcomes demonstrated that the effect of treatment site partly resulted from differences in patient preferences.<Reference refidx="15"/></ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_31"><Title>The Good Death</Title><SummarySection id="_32"><Title>The health care provider perspective</Title><Para id="_33">The concept of a good death is a controversial but potentially useful construct for the oncology clinician to more clearly formulate the goals of timely, compassionate, and effective EOL care.  In a 2003 British Medical Journal article about caring for the dying patient, the authors proposed that there were sufficient evidence-based guidelines to facilitate a good death; a  commentary that accompanied the article stated, “Nor can professional education convey adequately just how important it is for individuals, both at the time and afterwards, to go through the death of someone they love feeling that they are experiencing a ‘good death.’”<Reference refidx="16"/> Several salient points were made in subsequent letters to the editor:</Para><ItemizedList id="_34" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>The mental health of the patient and family are essential concerns in providing a good death.</ListItem><ListItem>Health care provider beliefs and attitudes may diminish the chances for a good death if they interfere with adequate pain or symptom control.</ListItem><ListItem>Health care providers may risk medical paternalism if they are not respectful of a patient’s perspective and insist on EOL care or refuse to provide comfort measures that may shorten life.</ListItem><ListItem>Religious faith and spiritual beliefs are important for many people near the EOL.</ListItem><ListItem>A good death requires turning one's attention away from prolonging life.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_35"><Title>The patient perspective</Title><Para id="_36">A landmark study of patients, families, and health care providers <Reference refidx="17"/> surveyed seriously ill patients, bereaved caregivers, physicians, and other health care providers about what matters at the EOL. Respondents scored the importance of 44 attributes identified in previous interviews and focus groups in which participants were asked to define a good death. There was broad agreement about control of pain and other symptoms, communication, and preparation for death. However, certain attributes such as not being a burden to one’s family or society, or being at peace with God, were ranked as important by patients but less so by physicians. A population-based study in the Netherlands demonstrated a correlation between the respondents’ positive attitudes toward the concept of a good death and preferences that could potentially influence EOL decision making.<Reference refidx="18"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_37"><Title>The caregiver perspective</Title><Para id="_38">In one study,<Reference refidx="19"/> formal and informal caregivers of 396 patients who died from advanced cancer were interviewed about the decedent’s QOL in the last week of life. The QOL was correlated with a variety of factors obtained via baseline interviews of decedents at the time of enrollment into the study and survey measures of coping styles, religious coping, religiousness/spirituality, and EOL preferences. Most variances in the QOL at EOL were unexplained. However, factors negatively correlated with QOL included the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_39" Style="bullet"><ListItem> Intensive care in the last week.</ListItem><ListItem>Death in the hospital.</ListItem><ListItem>Feeding tube in the final week.</ListItem><ListItem>Chemotherapy in the final week of life.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_40">Conversely, factors correlated with a higher QOL included the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_41" Style="bullet"><ListItem> Prayer or meditation.</ListItem><ListItem>Visits with chaplains.</ListItem><ListItem>The perception that the physician was respectful, open to questions, and trustworthy.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_42"><Title>Outcomes After Potentially Life-Prolonging Interventions</Title><SummarySection id="_43"><Title>CPR</Title><Para id="_44">CPR was initially developed to restore circulation in patients with predominantly cardiac insults. The outcomes after inpatient CPR in older adults have not improved significantly, in part because of the use of CPR in patients with comorbid life-threatening illnesses. Addressing the limited benefit of CPR during the transition to EOL care is made more difficult because in the United States, patients will undergo CPR unless there is an established DNR order in the medical chart to countermand the procedure. The following is a summary of  the evidence that demonstrates the very limited value of CPR in patients with  advanced cancer:</Para><ItemizedList id="_45" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>A retrospective chart review of 41 patients who underwent CPR for an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest found that only 18 (43%) survived to be admitted to an ICU, and only 9 patients survived to be discharged (2 to home; 7 to a facility).<Reference refidx="20"/> The authors noted that documentation of the advanced stage of disease and poor prognosis were frequently mentioned in the medical records.</ListItem><ListItem>A meta-analysis of survival after in-hospital CPR found that survival to discharge was 6.2% overall.<Reference refidx="21"/> Patients with advanced-stage disease, with hematological malignancy, and who underwent CPR in the ICU were less likely to survive to be discharged.</ListItem><ListItem>Researchers have described the extremely poor outcomes of patients who were resuscitated in the medical ICU.<Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/> Only 7 of 406 patients resuscitated (2%) survived to be discharged. The remainder died at the time of the arrest (63%) or died within a mean of 4 days (26%).</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_46"><Title>Admission to an ICU</Title><Para id="_47">In addition to CPR, patients may require mechanical ventilation or admission to ICUs. Outcomes are poor for patients with advanced cancer. One study reported that the median survival of 212 patients with advanced cancer (who were referred to a phase I trial) was 3.2 weeks.<Reference refidx="24"/> Patients who required CPR had a median survival of 1 day.</Para><Para id="_48"> The underlying diagnosis, however, may be a critical variable in predicting patient outcome. Patients with hematologic malignancies may do better than patients with solid tumors. For example, one study reported that patients with newly diagnosed hematologic malignancies had a 60.7% chance of surviving to be discharged and a 1-year survival rate of 43.3%.<Reference refidx="25"/> Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a remission status and early admission to the ICU were favorable risk factors.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="17329313">Kendall M, Harris F, Boyd K, et al.: Key challenges and ways forward in researching the "good death": qualitative in-depth interview and focus group study.

However, differences in study methodology, patient populations, measures of prognostic understanding, and the endpoint studied as the primary outcome of interest preclude definitive conclusions about the relevance of the correlations. Furthermore, causality can only be inferred, given the cross-sectional nature of most studies. Nonetheless, a summary of the published data organized by the measure of prognostic understanding may provide insight into the decision-making processes of patients with advanced cancer.</Para><ItemizedList id="_69" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Patients often provide overly optimistic estimates of the likelihood of survival beyond 6 months. One group of researchers analyzed the prognostic understanding (measured as an estimate of surviving beyond 6 months) of 917 adults with metastatic colorectal or lung cancer who were enrolled in SUPPORT.<Reference refidx="3"/> Patients who estimated a 90% or higher chance of surviving 6 months were more likely to prefer life-extending therapy and were more likely to experience a readmission, attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or death while on a mechanical ventilator.</ListItem><ListItem>Patients frequently fail to correctly report the goal of anticancer treatment. One group of researchers reported that at baseline, 30.4% of a cohort of 181 patients with advanced cancer believed the treatment was curative; 20% reported they did not know.<Reference refidx="20"/> Subjects who were not married, lived in rural areas, died within 6 months, or were receiving chemotherapy were more likely to report the goal of treatment as curative. At a 12-week assessment, fewer patients reported cure as a goal, but the difference was not significant. The results of this study are consistent with those of other studies reported between 1984 <Reference refidx="21"/> and the present.</ListItem><ListItem>Patients are often unaware of the terminal nature of the diagnosis of advanced cancer.

Patients with advanced cancer who had an opportunity to discuss their EOL preferences were more likely to receive care consistent with their preferences.<Reference refidx="23"/> 
 However, evidence suggests oncology clinicians often do not elicit or clarify patient preferences and, ultimately, fail to provide care consistent with their preferences. For example, a 2011 study <Reference refidx="24"/> of 128 patients with newly diagnosed advanced-stage lung cancer found that:</Para><ItemizedList id="_340" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>88.2% wanted to be informed about life expectancy (52.7% said they were informed).</ListItem><ListItem>63.5% wanted to be informed about palliative care (25% said they were informed).</ListItem><ListItem>56.8% wanted to be informed about EOL decisions (31% said they were informed).</ListItem><ListItem>None of the patients recalled being asked about their information preferences.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_341">The final observation highlights the fundamental question of how oncology clinicians should elicit patient preferences. While direct questioning may seem the most straightforward approach, a study of two single-item preference measures demonstrated that the decision-making preferences of patients appear to differ on the basis of what measure was utilized.<Reference refidx="25"/></Para><Para id="_342">The optimal way to elicit preferences, which would reduce the likelihood of failing to respect patients’ wishes, is not certain. Patients with advanced cancer have several preferences of potential significance to planning the transition to EOL care, including:</Para><ItemizedList id="_343" Style="bullet">

In  a study of 337 older patients’ attitudes about using advance directives to manage EOL care,<Reference refidx="26"/> 85% of respondents believed it was definitely (55%) or somewhat (30%) necessary to record their wishes in advance directives. However, most (80%) preferred either general value and goal statements or both precise and general directions.

Seventy-eight percent  of patients eventually chose chemotherapy. The only patient characteristic associated with preference for treatment was younger age. The strongest predictor of treatment choice was the preconsultation preference.</Para><Para id="_347">The preference for chemotherapy may relate in part to the observations that patients are not fully informed or they reject the information or reinterpret it to fit their perspectives.

Preferences that are foundational to more specific preferences might be better considered as  patient values.<Reference refidx="36"/>
 In addition to the preference being measured, the methods of measuring preferences vary significantly. The interested reader may consult a 2012 review <Reference refidx="37"/> 
 for a discussion of the different instruments. The following paragraphs highlight some notable observations.</Para><ItemizedList id="_350" Style="bullet" Compact="No">
     <ListItem>Multivariate analysis  of one study <Reference refidx="38"/>
demonstrated that advanced cancer patients’ preferences for chemotherapy were explained by higher values assigned to length of life and lower values for QOL. The last variable was measured by the Quality-Quantity Questionnaire (QQQ), which categorizes patients as favoring QOL or length of life, or having no preference.<Reference refidx="39"/> The patients’ preconsultation preferences were most strongly explained by striving for length of life rather than QOL. Given the lack of demonstrable survival benefit of chemotherapy in advanced cancer, the authors speculated that patients may not receive accurate information in the consultation that clearly delineates the goal of chemotherapy.</ListItem><ListItem>Another study <Reference refidx="40"/> interviewed 125 outpatients with cancer (all stages) about their attitudes toward treatment. Patients also completed the QQQ. The investigators found that patients who were older, tired, or more negative valued QOL more than others. Patients who were within  6 months of diagnosis rated length of life as more important. It should be noted, however, that patients did not rank the importance of length relative to quality in this study. There was a correlation between striving for QOL and appreciation for ACP.</ListItem><ListItem>A third study enrolled only patients with advanced cancer (459 respondents) and asked patients to rate the relative value of QOL or length of life.<Reference refidx="41"/> Fifty-five percent valued QOL and length of life equally; 27% preferred QOL; and 18% preferred length of life. A preference for QOL correlated with older age, male gender, and increased levels of education. Patients with a preference for length of life also preferred less pessimistic communication from oncologists.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_86"><Title>Patient Goals of Care</Title><Para id="_351">Discussions about goals of care with advanced-cancer patients are considered by many to be a critical component of planning the transition to EOL care. However, the definitions of <Emphasis>goals of care</Emphasis> vary significantly in the relevant literature. Before discussions about the relevant observations related to goals of care in patients with advanced cancer (and other life-limiting illnesses) take place, it is important to consider whether a distinction should be drawn between goals of treatment and goals of care.</Para><ItemizedList id="_352" Style="bullet" Compact="No">
     <ListItem>Some investigators have used the phrase <Emphasis>goals of care</Emphasis> to identify the goals of disease-directed treatments. Perhaps it would be clearer if such goals were labeled <Emphasis>goals of treatment.</Emphasis></ListItem><ListItem>Viewed another way, goals of care are distinct from goals related to treatment of disease with remittive or curative intent; these goals reflect the interests of patients and families after they have accepted that disease-directed treatments will not accomplish their intended goals and they seek “the profound human needs for meaning, comfort, and direction.”<Reference refidx="42"/> 
 From that perspective, goals of care are similar to the attributes that define a <SummaryRef href="CDR0000755559#_36" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/planning/end-of-life-hp-pdq">good death</SummaryRef>, as discussed earlier in this summary.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_353">Another perspective is that there is a continuum of goals and that the purpose of conversations about goals of care is to help patients identify the various alternatives for achieving their goals. A structured literature review and a qualitative analysis of palliative care consultations about goals of care support this perspective, as summarized below:</Para><ItemizedList id="_354" Style="bullet" Compact="No">
     <ListItem>One study analyzed relevant publications to establish a categorization of relevant goals of care for patients with life-limiting illnesses.<Reference refidx="42"/> 
 The authors proposed six comprehensive goals: be cured; live longer; improve or maintain function, QOL, and independence; be comfortable; achieve life goals; and provide support for family or caregiver.</ListItem><ListItem>Another study reported a qualitative analysis of prognostic communication in palliative care consultations.<Reference refidx="43"/>
 The investigators noted that palliative care physicians used a tactic of excluding certain goals of care as a means to encourage patients to think about alternative goals. This suggests that treatment-related goals are often replaced by more personal goals once disease-directed treatment is not advisable.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_87">At present, there are no data on the positive or negative influence of discussions about goals of care on the EOL outcomes of patients with advanced cancer.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_89"><Title>Religious and Spiritual Beliefs and Values of Patients</Title><Para id="_90">Patient religiosity and the provision of spiritual care consistent with a patient’s preference have been correlated with EOL outcomes. A series of reports from CwC <Reference refidx="44"/><Reference refidx="45"/><Reference refidx="46"/> found that approximately half of patients with serious or life-threatening illnesses indicated that religious or spiritual beliefs were important to them, as measured by higher scores on the Positive Religious Coping Scales subscale of the RCOPE, a measure of religious coping.<Reference refidx="47"/> RCOPE scores were significantly higher among African Americans and Hispanics.</Para><Para id="_91">In analyses adjusted for demographic differences, higher levels of positive religious coping were found to be significantly related to the receipt of mechanical ventilation, compared with low levels of religious coping (11.3% vs. 3.6%) and intensive life-prolonging care during the last week of life (13.6% vs. 4.2%).<Reference refidx="44"/> The degree to which religious and spiritual concerns are addressed by the care facility may substantially affect this relationship. Patients who reported that their spiritual needs were substantially supported by the medical team (26.3%) were significantly more likely to receive hospice care and less likely to receive aggressive care, and reported higher QOL.

Another group demonstrated that physicians exerted greater control over decisions when evidence for or against a treatment was less certain or if the cancer was advanced.<Reference refidx="49"/> Thus, the patient’s rationale for treatment and the relevance of the oncologist’s perspective change with the nature of the decision.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_101"><Title>Decision to limit treatment</Title><Para id="_102">Most deaths resulting from advanced cancer are preceded by decisions to limit treatment.

Patient preferences for comfort were more often in line with oncologists' preferences than were patient preferences for life-prolongation (91.4% vs. 46.7%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .001). Patients were involved in decisions to limit treatment only half of the time. Age, performance status, or decisional capacity did not influence the rate of patient involvement; agreement with oncologist preferences was the main predictor. Thus, decisions to limit treatment may reflect a shared perception rather than a shared decision-making process.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="7474243">A controlled trial to improve care for seriously ill hospitalized patients.

A summary of results follows, with independent observations cited as appropriate.</Para><ItemizedList id="_141" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Most oncologists disclosed the noncurative intent of chemotherapy in advanced cancer, but few discussed alternatives to chemotherapy.

However, older patients or patients without a stated preference were less likely to receive chemotherapy. There was a greater preference for chemotherapy if the anticipated survival gain was at least 3 months, if the treatment was mildly toxic, or if symptoms of disease progression were identified.

Patients with advanced cancer may be ambivalent about engaging in ACP with their oncologists because they perceive that oncologists are reluctant to engage in this discussion.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="13"/> For example, one group of researchers reported that 87% of women with metastatic breast cancer had discussed EOL decisions with family or friends; 75% had gathered information about advance directives; and 66% had a written advance directive.<Reference refidx="14"/> However, only 19% of those women had discussed EOL decisions with providers; only 24% had shared the written advance directives with the providers; and only 14 % of providers were aware of the advance directives. A study of hospitalized elderly patients similarly found that many had thought about EOL preferences (76.3%) or had an advance care plan (47.9%), but relatively few (30.3%) had discussed them with their physicians.<Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Para id="_240">These results suggest that patients engage in ACP but are reluctant to share their thoughts with their oncologists. Nevertheless, the oncologist is in the best position to know when to bring up the subject of EOL care, so he or she can initiate and thoughtfully guide the ACP discussion.<Reference refidx="16"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_241"><Title>ACP Reconsidered</Title><Para id="_242">Equivocal evidence is a  source of physician ambivalence about ACP. Despite early concerns, however, there is growing evidence that ACP improves EOL care in patients with advanced cancer.</Para><SummarySection id="_243"><Title>Early concerns about limits of ACP</Title><Para id="_244">Initial evidence about ACP was not favorable. For example, several studies found that:</Para><ItemizedList id="_245" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Fewer than 50% of terminally ill patients had advance directives in their medical records.<Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/></ListItem><ListItem>More than 65% of physicians were unaware that their patients had documented advance directives.<Reference refidx="20"/></ListItem><ListItem>Advance directives were not documented, were difficult to interpret, or were difficult for surrogates and physicians to follow.<Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="21"/></ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_246"><Title>Potential benefits of ACP</Title><Para id="_247">Since the 1990s,  randomized trials of ACP have demonstrated some benefit. For example, a randomized study compared usual care with a structured approach that included a motivational conversation with a social worker, and a booklet that described ACP and sought information about the patient’s desired health states and values.<Reference refidx="22"/> The primary outcomes were comparisons of how closely providers and patients agreed about the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_248" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Patient preferences to forgo life-prolonging treatment in hypothetical health states.</ListItem><ListItem>Values.</ListItem><ListItem>Personal beliefs about hypothetical health states.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_249">The intervention was associated with increased frequency of ACP discussions between physician and patient (64% vs. 38%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001), and the intervention group had higher levels of agreement for all three outcomes.<Reference refidx="22"/> The effect of ACP on health care outcomes was not studied.</Para><Para id="_250">A 2010 study monitored 309 patients older than 80 years and their caregivers for 6 months or until a patient died.<Reference refidx="23"/> Researchers found that patients who engaged in ACP were more likely to have preferences that are known to others, and to receive care consistent with those preferences. In addition, compared with family members of patients in the control group, family members of patients in the intervention (with ACP) group who died had significantly less stress (intervention 5, control 15; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001), anxiety (intervention 0, control 3; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .02), and depression (intervention 0, control 5; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .002). Also, patient and family satisfaction were higher in the intervention group.<Reference refidx="23"/></Para><Para id="_251">Studies funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality show that satisfaction in patients aged 65 years and older increased when patients engaged in ACP with their doctors. Specifically, patients who discussed their preferences for EOL care experienced less anxiety and fear; felt more sense of control over their medical care; and believed that their physicians had a better understanding of their wishes. Surrogates had similar benefits.<Reference refidx="24"/></Para><Para id="_252">A 2011 report also suggests that ACP contributes significantly to higher-value EOL care. Researchers demonstrated that the association between evidence of ACP and reduced EOL Medicare expenditures varied according to the level of spending on aggressive treatments near the EOL.<Reference refidx="25"/> Treatment-limiting advance directives were associated with lower levels of Medicare spending, lower likelihood of in-hospital death, and increased use of hospice in high-spending regions but not in low- or medium-spending regions. At a minimum, the study suggests that ACP may be one explanation for lower-cost regions.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_253"><Title>A more nuanced approach to ACP</Title><Para id="_254">Advocates maintain that ACP has been too narrowly construed as completion of a document that expresses a patient’s EOL preferences or identifies a surrogate decision maker if a patient can no longer make decisions. Generally speaking, most patients from Western countries express greater needs for information related to their illnesses, treatment options, prognoses, future symptoms, likely trajectories of illness, and the dying process. Younger and more educated patients tend to seek more detailed information, while older patients and those from non-Western cultures tend to prefer nondisclosure. From that perspective, the limitations of ACP can be addressed by reconceptualizing ACP.</Para><Para id="_255">One proposal is to imagine ACP as an ongoing discussion designed to prepare patients and their families or friends to participate more meaningfully in future medical decisions, as required.<Reference refidx="26"/> A focus group study of patients and surrogate decision makers identified four salient themes in discussing future health care decisions:<Reference refidx="27"/></Para><OrderedList id="_256" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>Identify values based on experiences and QOL.</ListItem><ListItem>Choose surrogates wisely and verify that they understand their roles.</ListItem><ListItem>Decide how much discretion to allow surrogate decision makers.</ListItem><ListItem>Inform others to prevent conflict.</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_257">Before discussing ACP, it is essential that the oncologist determine the information needs of the patient so that communication and ACP can be tailored accordingly.<Reference refidx="28"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_258"><Title>Interventions to Support Patient-Oncologist Communication</Title><Para id="_259">Various interventions to support patient-oncologist communication have been studied.

However, the variety of interventions will allow the interested oncology clinician to find one of interest.</Para><SummarySection id="_260"><Title>Written information</Title><Para id="_261">Myriad informational booklets are available for patients to consult; prognostic information is discussed in some of these booklets. Researchers conducted a mixed-methods study of the views of cancer patients on written materials provided by their oncologists.<Reference refidx="29"/> Patients expressed concerns that conflicting information could undermine their trust in their oncologists, and this concern influenced their willingness to consult written materials.</Para><Para id="_262">Another caution was raised by a randomized study that compared QOL and satisfaction between lung cancer patients scheduled for surgery who received verbal information only and those who received verbal and written information.<Reference refidx="30"/> There were no differences in patient satisfaction with information; however, patients who received verbal and written information were less satisfied with the hospital stay. Thus, the presentation of written information may have unintended consequences, and oncologists may consider distributing only information that reflects their actual practices.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_263"><Title>Audiotaped consultations</Title><Para id="_264">The impact of simply recording consultations on audiotape is significant, especially given the ease of doing so. In one randomized trial of initial consultations for all stages of cancer, 105 patients received audiotapes and 96 did not.<Reference refidx="31"/> Patients who received the audiotapes were more satisfied and had better recall of information than did those who did not receive the tapes. In addition, younger patients were more satisfied, and older patients experienced enhanced recall.

More patients in the video intervention group preferred comfort care than did patients in the verbal control group (91% vs. 22%, respectively).<Reference refidx="33"/></Para><Para id="_269">In the second study, 150 patients with advanced cancer from four cancer centers were randomly assigned to listen to a verbal description of CPR or to listen to the same verbal description and then be shown a 3-minute video of simulated CPR being done on a patient on a ventilator.<Reference refidx="34"/> The primary outcome was participants’ preference for or against CPR measured immediately after exposure to either modality. As in the first study, more patients receiving the video intervention with the narrative decided against CPR than did those receiving only the narrative (79% vs. 51%, respectively).  Knowledge scores were also significantly higher in the video arm (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001). Results at the 6- to 8-week follow-up demonstrated fairly stable decision results.

Intervention patients were less likely to die in the hospital (19% vs. 50%), and there was no increased sense of anxiety.

Patients assigned to meet with the mediator tended to be less satisfied with communication with health care professionals and less satisfied with future care.

Most respondents recognized the important clinical outcomes associated with decision aids, i.e., increased knowledge, reduced anxiety, and increased patient satisfaction. Lack of awareness was the most frequently cited barrier to use (69%), followed by lack of resources (24%) and lack of time to learn about decision aids (24%). Only 3% of respondents cited lack of time as a barrier to the use of decision aids.

For example, in 1984, one study reported that 37% of patients with metastatic, incurable cancer felt that treatment would cure their disease.<Reference refidx="3"/> Similarly, another study reported in 2012 that 69% of patients with advanced lung cancer and 81% of patients with advanced colorectal cancer enrolled in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) study were unaware that chemotherapy was not likely to cure their disease.<Reference refidx="4"/> In fact, almost 40% of patients with colorectal cancer responded that chemotherapy was very likely to cure the disease. A related analysis of the CanCORS data set revealed that only 16.5% of patients reported an accurate awareness of their prognosis.<Reference refidx="5"/> Similar results have been reported from a study of patients with advanced cancer that assessed their understanding of their prognosis at enrollment and 12 weeks later.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_382">Potential explanations for the communication deficits regarding prognosis are summarized in the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000755559#_111" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/planning/end-of-life-hp-pdq">Potential Barriers to Planning the Transition to End-of-Life Care</SummaryRef> section of this summary. Regardless of the explanation, however, misunderstandings about  prognosis compromise a patient’s ability to make informed health care decisions consistent with his or her values, goals, and preferences.  
Ultimately, each oncology clinician chooses, on some level, when and how to explain to a patient with advanced cancer that disease-directed treatments are very unlikely to prove effective and a continued focus on treatment risks harming the patient.</Para><Para id="_404">The goal of this summary section is to provide clinicians with  frameworks for considering their role in planning the transition to end-of-life (EOL) care and discussing the concept of transition with patients and their loved ones.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_383"><Title>The Patient-Clinician Relationship and Planning the Transition to EOL Care</Title><Para id="_384">It is  important for oncology clinicians to consider how their relationship with patients will help patients express preferences that are consistent with their values and goals for receiving high-quality EOL care. One study proposed the following four models of the physician-patient relationship, based on the goals of the interaction, the physician’s obligations, the role of patient values, and how patient autonomy influences the relationship:<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_385" Style="bullet" Compact="No">
     <ListItem><Strong>Paternalistic:</Strong> The focus is on the physician’s assessment and judgment of best treatment, with limited or no patient participation, other than providing consent.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Informative:</Strong> The focus is on the physician providing the patient with disease and treatment information that is as complete as possible, with decision making left to the patient.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Interpretive:</Strong> The physician acts as a counselor to help the patient discern his or her values and preferences, provides medical information, and then advises the patient about which appropriate tests and treatments best reflect the patient’s values.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Deliberative:</Strong>  The physician’s role is to assist the patient in both determining and then  choosing the best health-related goals and options, with the attitude of a friend or teacher.  The physician plays an active part in suggesting which values and options are the most worthy.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_386">In a carefully reasoned argument, the authors concluded that the preferred choice is the deliberative model, which can be paraphrased as a belief that patients’ goals and preferences are open to development and evolution. The goal of this relationship is to help the patient choose the best health-related goals and options that can be achieved, given the clinical situation. The physician’s obligation is to articulate for the patient the most compelling goals and preferences and to inform  the patient of other options. In that sense, the physician is a  teacher.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_387">Qualitative studies of patients’ perception of decision making suggest that the deliberative clinician-patient relationship is especially critical in advanced-stage cancer. For example, one group of investigators  interviewed 36 patients with potentially curable esophageal cancer about their decision to undergo esophagectomy. The investigators anticipated that themes related to autonomy, shared decision making, and information disclosure would become apparent; however, the following themes emerged:<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><OrderedList id="_405" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>Cultural belief in surgical cure.</ListItem><ListItem>Enhancement of trust through the referral process.</ListItem><ListItem>Idealization of the specialist surgeon.</ListItem><ListItem>Belief in expertise rather than medical information.</ListItem><ListItem>Resignation to the risks of treatment.</ListItem><ListItem>Acceptance of an expert recommendation as consent to treatment.</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_406">Another group of investigators interviewed patients with pancreatic carcinoma and identified a change in attitudes toward treatment decision making over time.<Reference refidx="9"/> Initially, patients described little interest in details about medical or surgical treatments and emphasized their trust in the physician. Later, as patients had more experience with disease progression and treatment, they described seeking a more proactive role in treatment decisions. All patients reported discussions about their poor prognosis, but a common theme was the difficulty in recognizing when it was time to stop treatment and transition to EOL care.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_388"><Title>Planning the Transition from Diagnosis to EOL Care</Title><Para id="_407">The word <Emphasis>transition</Emphasis> implies a passage from one place to another. Planning the transition to EOL care, therefore, requires a shared understanding of where the patient is in the advanced-cancer disease trajectory and why a transition is necessary or advisable.</Para><Para id="_389">The appropriate time to transition to EOL care is when the change is most consistent with the patient’s goals of care. In answering the question of when to transition to EOL care, the oncology clinician strives to be a teacher and trusted friend. The clinician must present his or her opinion of the effectiveness of continued cancer-directed treatments and help the patient understand the patient’s own values, perspectives, goals of care, and preferences. In this way, the clinician aids the patient in constructing treatment and care preferences toward the EOL.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_391">The concept of transition is often invoked from the health care provider’s perspective.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/> For example, patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy with curative intent are often spoken of as making a transition from the curative to the palliative phase of treatment.</Para><Para id="_400">The figure below depicts a phase model of planning the transition to EOL care for patients with advanced cancer. <MediaLink ref="CDR0000768790" type="image/jpeg" alt="Diagram showing a phase model of planning the transition to end-of-life (EOL)  care  in advanced cancer. " language="en" thumb="Yes" id="_401"><Caption language="en">A phase model of planning the transition to end-of-life (EOL)  care in advanced cancer. The trajectory of advanced cancer begins with the realization that disease-directed treatments are no longer curative. Over time, the patient, family, and oncology clinician should strive to develop a shared understanding of available treatments and recognize when the likelihood of benefit decreases in relation to the potential harm of treatment.  LST = life-sustaining treatment; EOL = end-of-life</Caption></MediaLink></Para><Para id="_397">Panel A of the figure demonstrates the increasingly unfavorable risk-benefit ratio of disease-directed treatments over time. This conceptualization is also from the oncology clinician’s perspective. The oncology clinician could choose two tactics to develop a shared understanding of the decline in the risk-to-benefit ratio:</Para><ItemizedList id="_398" Style="bullet" Compact="No">
     <ListItem><Strong>Distinguish between effectiveness and benefit:</Strong> The health care decisions of patients with advanced cancer toward the EOL may, at times, seem contrary to their best interests from the clinician’s perspective.<Reference refidx="13"/> A relevant explanation for the difference may be that patients think in terms of benefit, which includes both the chance of an outcome and its desirability; while clinicians think in terms of the evidence of effectiveness, which is assessed with probabilities.<Reference refidx="14"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Explore patient’s understanding of their prognosis and their goals at sentinel events:</Strong> There are relatively discrete points in the disease trajectory, called sentinel events, when the oncologist has an opportunity to clarify prognosis and discern patient goals and preferences.<Reference refidx="15"/> Sentinel events include scheduled assessments of the disease status (e.g., repeat tumor measurements after a prespecified number of cycles of chemotherapy), effects of chemotherapy on overall health-related quality of life, and the side effects of or complications from disease progression or therapy (e.g., decline in performance status).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_392">Panel B of the figure represents the concept of transitions. The disease trajectory is divided into five relatively discrete phases, from the diagnosis of advanced cancer to death. The first two phases are dominated by disease-directed strategies, including a phase in which the intent of disease-directed treatment is cure; and a second phase in which the intent of treatment is symptom relief, disease control and, perhaps, improved life expectancy. The EOL phase is subdivided into a time in which the patient is not receiving therapy but may still anticipate treatment in the future, and a phase in which the goal of care is to ensure that the EOL is free from undue burden or distress. Similar figures are often modified to include a diagonal line depicting a gradual increase in the focus on palliative care as the cancer progresses and life is more likely to end.</Para><Para id="_393">The figure represents the advanced-cancer trajectory to help oncologists formulate and articulate  the potentially salient differences between the phases from the oncologist’s perspective in terms of the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_394" Style="bullet" Compact="No">
     <ListItem>Treatment options, intent, range of possible outcomes, and  likelihood of potential outcomes.</ListItem><ListItem>The likely experience, including potential risks and the burden of each option in terms of side effects and practical requirements of treatment.</ListItem><ListItem>Key activities (e.g., chemotherapy), scheduled assessments of disease status, and the treatment experience associated with each option or phase.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_395">The oncology clinician should then endeavor to communicate the information in a compassionate manner that is comprehensible to the patient and family. (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000755559#_212" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/planning/end-of-life-hp-pdq">Strategies to Improve Patient-Oncologist Communication and Decision Making in Advanced Cancer</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information.)</Para><Para id="_396">Clearly describing each phase, however, does not necessarily inform patients of when it is time to transition. A focus group study of health care providers, patients with advanced cancer and other terminal illnesses, and family members prioritized three discrete communication skills as valuable to the dying person: giving bad news sensitively, talking about dying, and knowing when the patient was ready to talk about dying.<Reference refidx="16"/></Para><Para id="_399">In conclusion, the right time to transition away from disease-directed treatments toward EOL care depends, in large part, on the patient’s goals and preferences. The evidence indicates that conversations about EOL care are difficult but of great benefit to the patient. Oncologists who delay initiating these important conversations or who communicate in ambiguous or difficult-to-understand language fail to meet “the physician’s central task in caring for a gravely ill person near death[, which] is to accompany and guide the patient, who as a rule does not want to be dead, through the critical transition.”<Reference refidx="17"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="13730593">OKEN D: What to tell cancer patients.
