        factors are the presence or absence of systemic symptoms, the stage of disease,
        presence of large masses, and the quality and suitability of the treatment
        administered.  Other important factors are age, sex, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, extent of abdominal involvement, hematocrit, and absolute
        number of nodal sites of involvement.

        Among 10,019 patients who underwent central expert pathology review for the German Hodgkin Study Group, 84 patients (&lt;1%) were identified as having lymphocyte-depleted classical HL.

      <Para id="_534">
        Nodular lymphocyte–predominant HL is a clinicopathologic entity
        of B-cell origin that is distinct from classic HL.
        <Reference refidx="4" />
        <Reference refidx="5" />
        <Reference refidx="6" />
        The
        typical immunophenotype for lymphocyte-predominant disease is CD15-, CD20+,
        CD30-, CD45+, while the profile for classic HL is CD15+, CD20-,
        CD30+, CD45-.  Patients with lymphocyte-predominant disease have earlier-stage
        disease, longer survival, and fewer treatment failures than those with classic
        HL.
        <Reference refidx="7" />
        Despite a usually favorable prognosis, there is a tendency for histologic transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in around 10% of patients by 10 years.
        <Reference refidx="8" />
        Lymphocyte-predominant HL is usually
        diagnosed in asymptomatic young males with cervical or inguinal lymph nodes
        but usually without mediastinal involvement. Based on retrospective analyses spanning several decades and because of  the rarity of this histology, limited-field radiation therapy is the most common treatment approach for patients with early-stage disease.

      Clinical staging
      for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) includes a history, physical examination, laboratory studies (including
      sedimentation rate), and thoracic and abdominal/pelvic computerized tomographic
      (CT) scans.

      A prospective, multinational study of 260 newly diagnosed patients with HL obtained PET scans at baseline and after two cycles (four doses) of ABVD (doxorubicin plus bleomycin plus vinblastine plus dacarbazine); with a median follow-up of 2.2 years, the 2-year progression-free survival was 12.8% with a positive PET scan after two cycles and 95% with a negative PET scan after two cycles (

      In a prospective trial of BEACOPP-based therapy—which includes the drugs bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, vincristine sulfate, procarbazine, and prednisone— for previously untreated patients with advanced-stage HL, patients with residual abnormalities measuring 2.5 cm or more received a PET scan at the end of therapy.
      <Reference refidx="6" />
      A negative PET scan predicted no progression or relapse within 1 year for 94% of patients (confidence interval, 91%–97%).  Whether consolidation with radiation therapy can be omitted for PET-negative patients must await overall survival data at 5 years. Only further prospective studies that compare a PET response–adapted strategy versus standard therapy without alteration can assess whether improved outcomes can be achieved by altering the therapeutic strategy based on PET scan results.

        These recommendations are often modified in pediatric
        or advanced-staged adult patients who also receive chemotherapy.  Treatment is
        usually delivered to the neck, chest, and axilla (mantle field) and then to an
        abdominal field to treat para-aortic nodes and the spleen (splenic pedicle).  In some patients, pelvic nodes are treated with
        a third field.  The three fields constitute total nodal radiation therapy. In some
        cases, the pelvic and para-aortic nodes are treated in a single field called an
        inverted Y.  In patients with a favorable prognosis, treatment of the pelvic
        lymph nodes is frequently omitted, since fertility can be preserved without
        affecting relapse-free survival. (Refer to the PDQ summary on

        After six to eight cycles of BEACOPP, most men had testosterone levels within normal range; however, among women younger than 30 years, 82% recovered menses (mostly within 12 months), but only 45% of women older than 30 years recovered menses.

        The absolute excess risk of fatal cardiovascular disease ranges from 11.9 to 48.9 per 10,000 patient years and is  mostly attributable to fatal myocardial infarction (MI).

        The use of subcarinal blocking did not reduce the incidence of fatal MI in a retrospective review, perhaps because of the  exposure of the proximal coronary arteries to radiation.
        <Reference refidx="47" />
        In a cohort of 7,033 HL patients, MI mortality risk persisted through to 25 years after first treatment with supradiaphragmatic radiation therapy (dependent on the details of treatment planning), doxorubicin, or vincristine.

      Historically, radiation therapy alone had been the primary treatment for patients with early favorable HL, often after confirmatory negative staging laparotomy.  A randomized, prospective trial involving 542 patients with early favorable HL compared MOPP-ABV for three cycles plus involved-field radiation therapy (IF-XRT) with subtotal nodal radiation; with a median follow-up of 7.7 years, combined modality was favored in terms of 5-year event-free survival (98% vs. 74%,

      In summary, these randomized trials support the use of ABVD for four cycles with 20 Gy to 30 Gy IF-XRT.  Could the radiation therapy be omitted to minimize late morbidity and mortality from secondary solid tumors and from cardiovascular disease?
      <Reference refidx="16" />
      The NCIC study is the only trial to address this question in patients with early unfavorable HL; although four  to six cycles of ABVD alone has improved OS compared with a combined modality approach, the use of EF-XRT in the combined modality arm is excessive by current standards, and late effects will be magnified with these larger fields.

      Randomized studies with or without IF-XRT would be required, but no such studies are currently under way.

      However, the NCIC study does demonstrate a 92% OS for ABVD alone at a median follow-up of 11.3 years.  This would support the use of ABVD for patients with early unfavorable disease.

      <Para id="_450">
        Since Hodgkin lymphoma affects primarily young adults, most oncologists will
        eventually face the dilemma of how to provide therapy to a pregnant woman while
        minimizing the risk to the fetus.  Treatment choice must be individualized,
        taking into consideration the mother’s wishes, the severity and pace of the
        Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and the length of the remaining pregnancy.  Since general
        guidelines can never substitute for clinical judgment, oncologists should be
        prepared to alter the initial plans when necessary.

      <Title>Treatment Option Overview for HL During Pregnancy</Title>
      <Para id="_454">
        HL that is diagnosed in the first trimester of pregnancy does not constitute an absolute indication for therapeutic abortion.  Each patient must be looked at individually to take into account the stage and rapidity of growth of the lymphoma and the patient's wishes.
        <Reference refidx="3" />
        If the HL presents in
        early stage above the diaphragm and appears to be growing slowly, patients can
        be followed carefully with plans to induce delivery early and proceed with
        definitive therapy.
        <Reference refidx="4" />
        Alternatively, these patients can receive radiation
        therapy with proper shielding.
        <Reference refidx="5" />
        <Reference refidx="6" />
        <Reference refidx="7" />
        <Reference refidx="8" />
        Investigators at M.D. Anderson reported no
        congenital abnormalities in 16 babies delivered after the mothers had received
        supradiaphragmatic radiation while shielding the uterus with five half-value
        layers of lead.
        <Reference refidx="9" />
        Because of  theoretical risks that the fetus might develop future malignancies from even minimal scattered radiation doses outside the radiation field, radiation therapy should be postponed, if possible, until after delivery.
        <Reference refidx="10" />
      </Para>
      <Para id="_455">
        Chemotherapy that is administered in the first trimester has been
        associated with congenital abnormalities in as many as 33% of infants.
        <Reference refidx="11" />
        <Reference refidx="12" />
        However, in one  series, there were no adverse effects in 14 children of mothers
        who received a combination of mechlorethamine, vincristine,  procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) or
        a combination of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) during gestation, five 
        of whom began treatment during the first trimester.
        <Reference refidx="13" />
        Consequently, some
        women may opt to continue the pregnancy and agree to radiation therapy or
        chemotherapy if immediate treatment is required.
      </Para>
      <Para id="_456">
        In the second half of pregnancy, most patients can be followed carefully
        and can postpone therapy until induction of delivery at 32 to 36 weeks.
        <Reference refidx="11" />
        <Reference refidx="14" />
        <Reference refidx="15" />
        If
        chemotherapy is mandatory prior to delivery, such as for patients with
        symptomatic advanced stage disease, vinblastine alone (given at 6 mg/m²  intravenously every 2 weeks until induction of delivery) may
        be considered because  it has never been associated with fetal abnormalities in the
        second half of pregnancy.
        <Reference refidx="14" />
        <Reference refidx="15" />
        Steroids are employed both for their
        antitumor effect and  for hastening fetal pulmonary maturity.  As an
        alternative, a short course of radiation therapy can  be used prior to delivery in
        cases of respiratory compromise caused by the  rapidly enlarging mediastinal mass. 
        Combination chemotherapy with ABVD appears to be safe in the second half of
        pregnancy.
        <Reference refidx="13" />
        If chemotherapy is required after the first trimester, many
        clinicians prefer the combination of drugs over single-agent drugs or radiation
        therapy.
      </Para>
      <Para id="_457">
        In one study, the 20-year survival rate of pregnant women with HL did not differ  from the 20-year survival rate of nonpregnant women who were matched for similar stage of disease, age
        at diagnosis, and calendric year of treatment.
        <Reference refidx="16" />
        The long-term effects on
        progeny after chemotherapy in utero are unknown, though present evidence
        tends to be reassuring.
