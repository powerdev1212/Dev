Grief and mourning are closely related. Mourning is the way we show grief in public.  The way people mourn is affected by beliefs, religious practices, and cultural customs. People who are grieving are sometimes described as bereaved.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_12"><KeyPoint id="_13">Grief is the normal process of reacting to the loss.</KeyPoint><Para id="_56">Grief is the emotional response  to the loss of a loved one.

It may be felt by the families of people who are dying and  by the person dying. Anticipatory grief helps family members get ready emotionally for the loss. It can be a time to take care of unfinished business with the dying person, such as saying  “I love you” or “I forgive you.”

   </Para><Para id="_68">Like grief that occurs after the death of a loved one, anticipatory grief involves mental, emotional, cultural, and social responses.

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_253"><KeyPoint id="_254">Anticipatory grief does not always occur. </KeyPoint><Para id="_255">Some researchers report that anticipatory grief is rare. Studies showed that periods of acceptance and recovery usually seen during grief are not common before the patient’s actual death.

However, studies have found that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000430476">bereaved</GlossaryTermRef> people with high <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000450120">self-esteem</GlossaryTermRef> and/or a feeling that they have control over life are likely to have a normal grief reaction even after an unexpected loss. Bereaved people with low self-esteem and/or a sense that life cannot be controlled are more likely to have complicated grief after an unexpected loss. This includes more <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000430479">depression</GlossaryTermRef> and physical problems. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_38"><KeyPoint id="_107">The personality of the bereaved.</KeyPoint><Para id="_125">Studies have found that people with certain personality traits are more likely to have long-lasting depression after a loss. These include people who are  very dependent on the loved one (such as a spouse), and people who deal with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454701">distress</GlossaryTermRef> by thinking about it all the time.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_109"><KeyPoint id="_110">The religious beliefs of the bereaved.</KeyPoint><Para id="_126">Some studies have shown that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000489395">religion</GlossaryTermRef> helps people <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454700">cope</GlossaryTermRef> better with grief. Other studies have shown it does not help or causes more distress. Religion seems to help people who go to church often. The positive effect on grief may be  because church-goers have more <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000440116">social support</GlossaryTermRef>. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_112"><KeyPoint id="_113">Whether the bereaved is male or female.</KeyPoint><Para id="_127">In general, men have more problems than women do after a spouse’s death. Men tend to have worse depression and more health problems  than women do after the loss. Some researchers think this may be because men have less social support after a loss.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_115"><KeyPoint id="_116">The age of the bereaved.</KeyPoint><Para id="_117">In general, younger bereaved people have more problems after a loss than older bereaved people  do. They have more severe health problems, grief <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045022">symptoms</GlossaryTermRef>, and other mental and  physical symptoms. Younger bereaved people, however, may recover more quickly than older bereaved people do, because they have more resources and social support.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_118"><KeyPoint id="_119">The amount of social support  the bereaved has.</KeyPoint><Para id="_128">Lack of social support increases the chance of having problems  coping with a loss. Social support includes the person's family, friends, neighbors, and community members who can give <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454766">psychological</GlossaryTermRef>, physical, and financial help. After the death of a close family member, many people have a number of related losses. The death of a spouse, for example, may cause a loss of income and changes in lifestyle and day-to-day living. These are all related to social support.

The second phase includes  coping with the loss by retelling the story of the death. This helps bereaved people who try not to think about their loss. </ListItem><ListItem>

The last phase looks at progress that has been made toward recovery and helps the bereaved make future plans.

IPT is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on the person's relationships with others and is helpful in treating <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000430479">depression</GlossaryTermRef>. In patients with complicated grief,  the CGT was more helpful than IPT.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_168"><KeyPoint id="_169">Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for complicated grief was helpful in a clinical trial.</KeyPoint><Para id="_163"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000650559">Cognitive behavioral therapy</GlossaryTermRef> (CBT)   works with the way a person's thoughts and behaviors are connected.

Some health care professionals think depression  is a normal part of grief and doesn't need to be treated.

once in a while and for  short times. This may be because a child
is not able to feel strong emotions for long periods of time. A grieving child may be sad one minute and playful the next. 
Often families think the child doesn’t really understand the loss or has gotten over
it quickly.  Usually, neither is true. Children’s minds protect them from what is too
much for them to handle emotionally.</ListItem><ListItem>Mourning  is a process that continues over years in children. Feelings of  loss may
occur again and again as the child gets older. This is common at important times, such as
going to camp, graduating from school, getting married, or having children.
</ListItem><ListItem>Grieving children
may not show their feelings as openly as adults.  Grieving children may throw themselves
into activities  instead of withdrawing or showing grief.</ListItem><ListItem>Children cannot think through their thoughts and feelings like adults. Children have trouble putting their feelings about grief into words. Strong feelings of anger and fears
of death or being left alone may show up in the behavior of grieving children. 
Children often play death games as a way of working out their feelings and
worries.  These games give children a safe
way to express their feelings.
</ListItem><ListItem>Grieving adults may withdraw and not talk to other people about the loss. 
Children, however, often talk to the people around them (even strangers) to see
 how they react and to get clues for how they should respond to the loss.  </ListItem><ListItem>Children may
ask confusing questions.  For example, a child may ask, "I know grandpa died,
but when will he come home?"  This is a way of testing reality and making sure
the story of the death has not changed.

Children at this age are often very curious about death, and may ask questions about what happens to the body when it dies. Death is thought of as a person or spirit separate from the person who was alive, such as a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044221">skeleton</GlossaryTermRef>, ghost, angel, or bogeyman.

Children should not be forced to be involved in these ceremonies, but encourage them to take part when they feel comfortable doing so. Before a child attends a funeral, wake, or memorial service, give the child a full explanation of what to expect. A familiar adult or family member may help with this if the surviving parent's grief  makes him or her unable to.

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/espanol/recursos/pdq">Spanish</ExternalRef>.</Para><Para id="_AboutThis_4">PDQ is a service of the NCI.

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_AboutThis_10"><Title>Clinical Trial Information</Title><Para id="_AboutThis_11">A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
