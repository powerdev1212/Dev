In humans, NDV causes mild flu-like <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045022">symptoms</GlossaryTermRef> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000386193">conjunctivitis</GlossaryTermRef> (an infection of the eye that is also called pink eye) and/or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044605">laryngitis</GlossaryTermRef> (an irritation and swelling of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000520366">voice box</GlossaryTermRef> and the area around it).</Para><Para id="_6">Like other viruses, NDV infects <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046476">cells</GlossaryTermRef> (called <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044597">host cells</GlossaryTermRef>) and then uses those cells to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044621">replicate</GlossaryTermRef> (make  copies of) itself.  Researchers are interested in NDV because it 
replicates  itself more quickly in human <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef> cells than in most normal human cells and it can kill the host cells.  For these reasons, the virus is being studied as a treatment for cancer. 
</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_34"><Question>What is the history of the discovery and use of Newcastle disease virus as a complementary or alternative treatment for cancer?</Question><Answer><Para id="_7">The first report that NDV may be useful as a cancer treatment was published in 1964.  For 20 years before this report, NDV was used in a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045938">vaccine</GlossaryTermRef> to prevent Newcastle disease in birds.  During that time, it was learned that NDV caused only minor illness in humans.  The mild <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046580">side effects</GlossaryTermRef> caused by NDV in humans and its ability to replicate up to 10,000 times faster in human cancer cells than in most normal human cells, led <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044964">complementary and alternative medicine</GlossaryTermRef> researchers to look more closely at NDV as a possible cancer treatment. NDV is now being studied by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449752">conventional medicine</GlossaryTermRef> researchers also. </Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_40"><Question>What is the theory behind the claim that Newcastle disease virus is useful in treating cancer?</Question><Answer><Para id="_41">There are many strains of NDV, and they may be either <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044837">lytic</GlossaryTermRef> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044838">nonlytic</GlossaryTermRef> for human cells. Lytic strains kill the infected cell by damaging its outer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046294">membrane</GlossaryTermRef> (layer of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissue</GlossaryTermRef>). Nonlytic strains kill by blocking the basic processes a cell needs to live.    Lytic strains of NDV have been studied in humans because they can kill cancer cells directly, but both lytic and nonlytic strains have been used to make vaccines  to help the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356">immune system</GlossaryTermRef> fight cancer.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_35"><Question>How is Newcastle disease virus administered?</Question><Answer><Para id="_8">The way NDV is given depends on how the virus is used to target cancer cells. It may be used to directly infect the patient with NDV or to make <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044952">cancer vaccines</GlossaryTermRef>. Cancer vaccines made with NDV may improve the body’s natural <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045722">immune response</GlossaryTermRef> to cancer, causing it to attack and kill more cancer cells than it would if the NDV were not present.  Researchers are studying 3 ways of using NDV as a possible cancer treatment:</Para><ItemizedList id="_9" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem><Strong>Infection of the cancer patient with NDV</Strong>  <Para id="_45">NDV can be <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044678">injected</GlossaryTermRef> directly into the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumor</GlossaryTermRef>, a muscle, or a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000476471">vein</GlossaryTermRef> (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044050">intravenous injection</GlossaryTermRef>), or into the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046462">colon</GlossaryTermRef>. The virus can also be <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044600">inhaled</GlossaryTermRef>. As explained in <SummaryRef href="CDR0000446370#_33" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/ndv-pdq">Question 1</SummaryRef>, NDV infects cells and then replicates itself, creating more copies of the virus that can then infect cells throughout the body.  This process targets and kills cancer cells by damaging the cells' outer membranes. </Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Oncolysate vaccine.</Strong><Para id="_46"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044611">Oncolysate</GlossaryTermRef> vaccines are made using pieces of cancer cell membranes infected with NDV.

Research in a laboratory or using animals is done to find out if a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000348921">drug</GlossaryTermRef>, procedure, or treatment is likely to be useful in humans. These preclinical studies are done before any testing in humans is begun. The following has been learned from preclinical studies:</Para><ItemizedList id="_13" Style="bullet"><ListItem>NDV replicates more quickly in human cancer cells than in any other type of cell.</ListItem><ListItem>Some types of NDV are able to directly kill certain types of cancer cells.</ListItem><ListItem>NDV and NDV-infected cancer cells can cause the immune system to respond in different ways.  </ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_14">A few of these studies used human cells, but most used animal cells.  Based on these and other laboratory findings,  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045961">clinical trials</GlossaryTermRef> (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000651211">research studies</GlossaryTermRef> with people) using NDV were begun.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_37"><Question>Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) of NDV been conducted?</Question><Answer><Para id="_15">Clinical trials of NDV have been done  but have not proven that NDV is effective as a cancer treatment. Some of the trials reported positive results and some did not. Most of the studies  enrolled only small numbers of patients who also received <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044930">standard treatments</GlossaryTermRef>. None of the trials published in English were  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045858">randomized</GlossaryTermRef> and few were <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044014">controlled</GlossaryTermRef>. Randomized clinical trials give the highest level of evidence. In randomized trials, volunteers are assigned randomly (by chance) to one of 2 or more groups that compare different factors related to the treatment. In a controlled clinical trial, one group (called the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044149">control group</GlossaryTermRef>) does not receive the new treatment being studied. The control group is then compared to the groups that receive the new treatment, to see if the new treatment works. Randomized controlled trials, enrolling larger numbers of people, are needed to confirm the results of studies done so far on the use of NDV to treat cancer.</Para><Para id="_43">Clinical trials studying the use of NDV as a cancer treatment have been done in the United States, Canada, China, Germany, and Hungary.  Below are brief descriptions of these studies.</Para><Para id="_16"><Strong>Studies Using Oncolysate Vaccines</Strong></Para><Para id="_17">Four clinical trials in the United States studied the use of NDV oncolysates in patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044058">metastatic</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045135">melanoma</GlossaryTermRef>. Three of these studies, a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045830">phase I clinical trial</GlossaryTermRef> and 2 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045831">phase II clinical trials</GlossaryTermRef>, were  by the same group of researchers.  Some positive results were found in these studies.  The fourth trial was led by different researchers and showed no benefit.  The same type of NDV was used to make the vaccines in all 4 studies, but the 2 groups of researchers used different methods to make them.  Results from these studies need to be confirmed by randomized controlled trials that enroll larger numbers of people.  </Para><Para id="_18">Two other phase II trials of NDV oncolysates were done in Germany.  One of the studies showed that people in the trial had longer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044023">disease-free survival</GlossaryTermRef> when compared with published information on similar patients who were treated with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045570">surgery</GlossaryTermRef> alone.  Because these studies were not controlled and the patients received other treatments, it is not clear if it was the treatment with NDV oncolysates that caused the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044085">responses</GlossaryTermRef> reported.</Para><Para id="_19"><Strong>Studies Using Whole-cell Vaccines</Strong></Para><Para id="_20">Most of the published clinical studies of whole-cell vaccines with NDV have been done in Germany.  The largest reported trial was in China. Most of these studies involved patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000444983">colorectal cancer</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000444971">breast cancer</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000445074">ovarian cancer</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044988">renal cell (kidney) cancer</GlossaryTermRef>, or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045772">malignant</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045700">glioma</GlossaryTermRef>.  The same type of NDV was used to make the vaccines in all of the studies.  </Para><Para id="_49">Some of these studies found improved disease-free survival or improved <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044070">overall survival</GlossaryTermRef> in patients treated with whole-cell vaccines. The lack of control groups and other weaknesses in  study design and reporting made it unclear if benefits were caused by the whole-cell vaccine or by something else. Overall, the results showed that these vaccines may help the immune system kill more cancer cells during the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045937">vaccination</GlossaryTermRef> program but may not provide long-term cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000468803">immunity.</GlossaryTermRef> 
</Para><Para id="_21"><Strong>Studies Involving Infection with NDV (Including MTH-68)</Strong></Para><Para id="_50">Most research on the treatment of cancer by infecting patients with NDV has been done in Hungary, using the NDV strain MTH-68. The published findings include the following types of studies:</Para><ItemizedList id="_51" Style="bullet"><ListItem>An <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043995">anecdotal report</GlossaryTermRef> (incomplete descriptions of the medical and treatment history of one or more patients).</ListItem><ListItem>A <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044007">case report</GlossaryTermRef> (a detailed report of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046450">diagnosis</GlossaryTermRef>, treatment, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044671">follow-up</GlossaryTermRef> of an individual patient).</ListItem><ListItem>A small <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044006">case series</GlossaryTermRef> (a group of case reports involving patients who were given similar treatment).</ListItem><ListItem>A phase II clinical trial.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_52">According to the researchers, the MTH-68 treatment was helpful for most of the patients in these studies. The number of patients in the studies was small, however, and the patients in the clinical trial were not randomly assigned. The patients also received other treatments. For these reasons, it is not known if the patients were helped by the MTH-68 or by something else.
</Para><Para id="_23">In the United States, a phase I clinical trial tested <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000285942">PV701</GlossaryTermRef>, another type of NDV.  In this trial, 79 patients with advanced cancers that were not helped by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044198">conventional therapy</GlossaryTermRef> were given PV701 by injection into a vein.  Some patients had <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045819">partial responses</GlossaryTermRef> to the treatment, while others did not have any change in their <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000651193">condition.</GlossaryTermRef>  More studies are planned.</Para><Para id="_24">One major concern is that repeated injections of NDV may cause a person's immune system to form <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044918">antibodies</GlossaryTermRef> against the virus. These antibodies would prevent NDV from infecting and killing cancer cells.  More research is needed to study this.</Para><Para id="_53">While most studies of NDV in cancer treatment have been small and without control groups, there have been enough promising results to call for continued research. </Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_38"><Question>Have any side effects or risks been reported from NDV?</Question><Answer><Para id="_26">The side effects caused by NDV exposure have been mild to moderate.  As noted in <SummaryRef href="CDR0000446370#_33" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/ndv-pdq">Question 1</SummaryRef>, NDV causes mild flu-like symptoms, conjunctivitis, and laryngitis in humans.  Other side effects vary with how the virus is given.</Para><ItemizedList id="_27" Style="bullet"><ListItem>The most commonly reported side effect after treatment with the virus alone is <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000450108">fever</GlossaryTermRef>, which usually goes away within 24 hours.

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_2"><Title>General CAM Information</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_3">Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also referred to as integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_4">Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_5">Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. </Para></SummarySection> 
  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_6"><Title>Evaluation of CAM Approaches</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_7">It is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute  and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_8">Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH)  in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.</Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_9"><ExternalRef xref="http://cam.cancer.gov/cam/best_case_intro.html">The NCI Best Case Series Program</ExternalRef>   which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM.
