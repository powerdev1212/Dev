Extensive disease is TNM stage IV with distant metastases (M1) including malignant pleural effusions.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_274">
        The IASLC conducted an analysis of clinical TNM staging for SCLC using the sixth edition of the AJCC TNM staging system for lung cancer. Survivals for patients with clinical stages I and II disease are significantly different from those for patients with stage III disease with N2 or N3 involvement.<Reference refidx="3"/> Patients with pleural effusion have an intermediate prognosis between LD and ED with hematogenous metastases and will be classified as having M1 disease (or ED). Application of the TNM system will not change how patients are managed; however, the analysis suggests that, in the context of clinical trials in LD, accurate TNM staging and stratification may be important.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_50"><Title>Staging Evaluation</Title><Para id="_51">Staging procedures for SCLC are important to distinguish patients with disease limited to their thorax from those with distant metastases. At the time of initial diagnosis, approximately two-thirds of patients with SCLC have clinical evidence of metastases; most of the remaining patients have clinical evidence of extensive nodal involvement in the hilar, mediastinal, and sometimes supraclavicular regions.</Para><Para id="_199">Determining the stage of cancer allows an assessment of prognosis and a determination of treatment, particularly when chest radiation therapy or surgical excision is added to chemotherapy for patients with LD. If ED is confirmed, further evaluation should be individualized according to the signs and symptoms unique to the individual patient. Standard staging procedures include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_52" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>A thorough physical examination.</ListItem><ListItem>Routine blood counts and serum chemistries.</ListItem><ListItem>Chest and upper abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning.</ListItem><ListItem>A radionuclide bone scan.</ListItem><ListItem>A brain magnetic resonance imaging scan or CT scan.</ListItem><ListItem>Bone marrow aspirate or biopsy in selected patients in which treatment would change based on the results.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_53">The role of positron emission tomography (PET) is still under study. SCLC is  fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avid at the primary site and at metastatic sites. PET may be used in staging patients with SCLC who are potential candidates for the addition of thoracic radiation therapy to chemotherapy, as PET may lead to upstaging or downstaging of patients and to alteration of radiation fields resulting from the identification of additional sites of nodal metastases.</Para><Para id="_200">Evidence (FDG-PET):</Para><OrderedList id="_201" Style="Arabic" Compact="No">
