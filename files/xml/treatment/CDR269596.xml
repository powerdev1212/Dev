The use of mistletoe as a treatment for people with cancer has been investigated in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044195">clinical studies</GlossaryTermRef>.

These weaknesses include registration of small numbers of patients; presence of large numbers of patients who either were not <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044029">evaluable</GlossaryTermRef> or were otherwise excluded from the analyses; failure to adequately document mistletoe use, mistletoe <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044664">dose</GlossaryTermRef>, and/or interruptions of mistletoe use; absence of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044149">control subjects</GlossaryTermRef> or use of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044596">historical control subjects</GlossaryTermRef>; use of inadequate <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000322881">randomization</GlossaryTermRef> procedures; absence of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000285982">treatment blinding</GlossaryTermRef>; extensive use of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000285981">subset analysis</GlossaryTermRef>; and the measurement of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000285973">mean</GlossaryTermRef> as opposed to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044941">median</GlossaryTermRef> survival.

In addition, evaluation of the studies is often hindered by incomplete descriptions of the study design and by incomplete reporting of clinical data, including data about previous and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044011">concurrent therapies</GlossaryTermRef> received by the patients.

The overall conclusion of the authors in the report of these three studies was that Iscador treatment can produce a clinically significant increase in survival in cancer patients.  However, there were several weaknesses in the design and execution of these studies.  In a large cohort study, the investigators were unable to find matched cohorts for 61% of eligible patients, and even among the patients for whom matches were found, fewer than two-thirds  were judged to adhere strictly to the matching criteria;  thus, the final analysis contained fewer than 25% of eligible patients.  In the two small prospective studies, no records of the amount or duration of Iscador use were kept.</Para><Para id="_109">The use of Iscador as an adjuvant treatment has been examined in several studies.

A total of 1,442 patient records (710 treated patients and 732 untreated controls) were randomly selected from medical institutions that provided both standard and alternative treatments.  Safety and efficacy were measured by the number and severity of adverse <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000348921">drug </GlossaryTermRef> reactions.

Eight hundred and four consecutive colorectal patients (429  treated with Iscador and 375  controls) from 26 hospitals and practices were included.

The largest of these studies involved 477 patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046595">squamous cell carcinoma</GlossaryTermRef> of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000257519">head and neck</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="15"/> These patients were randomly assigned to treatment with surgery or surgery and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044971">radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef>, and they were randomly assigned again to either no additional treatment or treatment with Eurixor. This double randomization produced the following four groups: (1) 105 patients treated with surgery alone; (2) 97 patients treated with surgery and Eurixor; (3) 137 patients treated with surgery and radiation therapy; and (4) 138 patients treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and Eurixor. Eurixor was administered in four treatment cycles over a 60-week period. Each treatment cycle lasted 12 weeks and was followed by a 4-week break period.  During each cycle, Eurixor was administered by subcutaneous injection twice a week. Each injection contained enough standardized mistletoe extract to yield a dose of 1 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000285977">nanogram</GlossaryTermRef> of ML-1 lectin per <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044576">kilogram</GlossaryTermRef> of body weight. The results of this randomized trial showed that treatment with Eurixor did not improve either 5-year <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044023">disease-free survival</GlossaryTermRef> or 5-year <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044311">disease-specific survival</GlossaryTermRef>.  In addition, no stimulation of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356">immune system</GlossaryTermRef> or improvement in quality of life was found with Eurixor treatment.</Para><Para id="_184">It has been suggested that a less-than-optimum dose of mistletoe was administered to patients in this trial.<Reference refidx="4"/> The same dose of Eurixor, however, has been used in other clinical studies, including studies in which benefit was reported.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="33"/> In addition, both the dose and the duration of Eurixor treatment in this trial are consistent with those recommended by the manufacturer.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_185">A prospective, randomized phase II trial  involved 45 patients who had noninvasive bladder cancer.<Reference refidx="3"/> After surgery, the patients were randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of treatment with Eurixor or no further therapy. The goal of the study was to determine whether Eurixor treatment could reduce bladder cancer recurrence. Twenty-three patients were randomly  assigned to the treatment group, and 22 were randomly assigned to the control group. Each cycle of Eurixor treatment consisted of 3 months of subcutaneous injections, administered twice a week, followed by a 3-month break period. One milliliter of Eurixor was administered at each injection. After 18 months of follow-up, 11 recurrences were observed in the treatment group, and 8 were observed in the control group. The average time of recurrence for the treatment group was 6.3 months; for the control group, it was 6.4 months. The median disease-free interval for the treatment group was 9 months; for the control group, it was 10.5 months. None of these differences was considered significant.</Para><Para id="_186">A major concern about this study, however, is that the dose of lectin ML-1 administered to patients was not adjusted for  body weight.      </Para><Para id="_226">Eurixor is no longer available  on the market for sale.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_187"><Title>Isorel</Title><Para id="_188">Only two trials of Isorel have been reported in the publicly available, online indexed peer-reviewed medical literature.

In certain European countries, the preparations made from European mistletoe (<ScientificName>Viscum album</ScientificName> L.) are among the most prescribed drugs offered to cancer patients. Mistletoe <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000407760">extracts</GlossaryTermRef> have been evaluated in numerous <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044195">clinical studies</GlossaryTermRef> and improvements in survival, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef>, and/or stimulation of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356">immune system</GlossaryTermRef> have been frequently reported. However, most clinical studies conducted to date have had one or more major weaknesses that raise doubts about the reliability of the findings. In addition, no evidence exists to support the notion that stimulation of the immune system by mistletoe leads to an improved ability to fight cancer. Because all patients in the reported clinical studies appear to have been adults, no information is available about the use of mistletoe as a treatment for children with cancer. </Para><Para id="_94">Separate <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000446533">levels of evidence</GlossaryTermRef> scores are assigned to qualifying human studies on the basis of statistical strength of the study design and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044724">scientific</GlossaryTermRef> strength of the treatment outcomes (i.e., <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000346519">endpoints</GlossaryTermRef>) measured.
