Lung cancer is more common in men than women and in those of lower socioeconomic status.  Patterns of lung cancer according to demographic characteristics tend to be strongly correlated with historical patterns of cigarette smoking prevalence.  An exception to this is the very high rate of lung cancer in African American men, a group whose very high lung cancer death rate is not explainable simply by historical smoking patterns.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_168">In nonsmokers, important lung cancer risk factors are exposure to secondhand smoke, exposure to ionizing radiation, and occupational exposure to lung carcinogens, such as asbestos. Radiation exposures relevant to the general population include environmental exposure to radon and radiation exposures administered in the medical care setting, particularly when administered at high doses, such as radiation therapy to the chest or breast.<Reference refidx="2"/> Cigarette smoking often interacts with these other factors.  There are several examples, including radon exposure and asbestos exposure, in which the combined exposure to cigarette smoke plus another risk factor results in an increase in risk that is much greater than the sum of the risks associated with each factor alone.</Para><SummarySection id="_172"><Title>Factors associated with increased risk of lung cancer</Title><SummarySection id="_173"><Title>Cigarette smoking</Title><Para id="_174">Starting with the 1964 Surgeon General’s Report and followed by each subsequent Surgeon General’s Report that has included a review of the evidence on smoking and lung cancer, an enormous body of scientific evidence clearly documents that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, and that cigarette smoking is the major cause of lung cancer.</Para><Para id="_175">Based on solid evidence, cigarette smoking causes lung cancer.

 158,040 deaths predicted in 2015 in men and women combined.<Reference refidx="1"/> Lung cancer causes more deaths per year in the United States than the next four leading causes of cancer death combined.  Lung cancer incidence and
mortality rates increased markedly throughout most of the last century, first in
men and then in women.  The trends in lung cancer incidence and mortality rates  have closely mirrored historical patterns of smoking prevalence, after accounting for an appropriate latency period. Because of historical differences in smoking prevalence between men and women, lung cancer rates in men have been consistently declining  since 1990. The incidence rate in men declined from a high of 102.1 cases per 100,000 men in 1984 to 78.6 cases per 100,000 men in 2011. Consistent declines in women have not  been seen.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>   In the United States, it  is estimated that lung cancer will account for about 13% of new cancer cases and about 27% of all cancer deaths in 2015. Lung
cancer is  the leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women.  In 2015, it
is estimated that  71,660 deaths will occur among U.S. women due to lung
cancer, compared with  40,290 deaths due to breast cancer.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_219">Lung cancer incidence and mortality is highest in African Americans compared with any other racial/ethnic group in the United States, primarily due to the very high rates in African American men. Between 2007 and 2011, the incidence rate in black men was higher than in white men (93 vs. 72.4 cases per 100,000 men, respectively), whereas among women no racial difference in incidence rates was present (51.1 vs. 51.2 cases per 100,000 women, respectively). Similarly, the mortality rates among black men were higher than among white men during the same time frame (87.5 vs. 68.3 deaths per 100,000 men, respectively), whereas the mortality rates among black women were  lower than among white women (36.5 vs. 39.8 deaths per 100,000 women, respectively).<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_220">Surgical treatment or radiation therapy is the treatment of choice for early
stages of cancer.<Reference refidx="4"/>  The overall 5-year relative survival rate from lung cancer was 16% in 2006. Lung cancer survival is worse for men compared with women and for blacks compared with whites.  For example, 5-year lung cancer survival was 18% lower in black men compared with white men (11.3% vs. 13.8%, respectively) and 23% lower in black women compared with white women (14.4% vs. 18.6%, respectively).<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_221">The hypothesis has been proposed that women may be more susceptible than men to smoking-caused lung cancer.  However, the results of studies that have compared the association between smoking and lung cancer in men and women using appropriate comparisons do not support  this hypothesis.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_222">The results of the Multi-Ethnic Cohort Study indicated that for a given degree of cigarette smoking, African Americans had a higher risk of lung cancer compared with other racial/ethnic groups.<Reference refidx="6"/> Menthol cigarettes have been hypothesized as one potential factor contributing to the observed greater susceptibility to smoking-caused lung cancer in African Americans, but menthol cigarettes have not been observed to be associated with a higher risk of lung cancer than nonmenthol cigarettes.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_223"><Title>Cigarette smoking is the primary risk factor</Title><Para id="_224">The epidemic of lung cancer in the 20th century was  primarily due to increases
in cigarette smoking,  the predominant cause of lung cancer.  The  threefold 
variation in lung cancer mortality rates across the United States more or less parallels
long-standing state-specific differences in the prevalence of cigarette smoking.  For example,  average annual age-adjusted lung cancer death rates for 1996 to 2000 were
highest in Kentucky (78 deaths per 100,000 individuals) where 31%  were current
smokers in 2001; whereas the lung cancer death rates were  lowest in Utah (26 deaths per 100,000 individuals), which had the lowest prevalence of cigarette smoking (13%).<Reference refidx="9"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_225"><Title>The biology of carcinogenesis</Title><Para id="_226">Understanding the biology of carcinogenesis is crucial to the development of
effective  prevention and treatment strategies.  Two  important concepts in this regard  are the multistep nature of carcinogenesis and the diffuse field-wide
carcinogenic process.  Epithelial cancers in the lung appear to develop in a
 series of steps extending over years.  Epithelial carcinogenesis is
conceptually divided into three phases: initiation, promotion, and progression. 
This process has been inferred from human studies identifying
clinical-histological premalignant lesions (e.g., metaplasia and dysplasia).
The concept of field carcinogenesis is that multiple independent neoplastic
lesions occurring within the lung can result from repeated exposure to
carcinogens, primarily tobacco.  Patients developing cancers of the
aerodigestive tract secondary to cigarette smoke also are likely to have
multiple premalignant lesions of independent origin within the
carcinogen-exposed field.  The concepts of multistep and field carcinogenesis
provide a model for prevention studies.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_227"><Title>Risk Factors</Title><SummarySection id="_228"><Title>Factors associated with increased risk of lung cancer</Title><SummarySection id="_229"><Title>Cigarette smoking</Title><Para id="_230">The most important risk factor for lung cancer (and for many other cancers) is cigarette smoking.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/> Epidemiologic data have established that cigarette smoking is the predominant cause of lung cancer. This causative link has been widely recognized since the 1960s, when national reports in Great Britain and the United States brought the cancer risk of smoking prominently to the public’s attention.<Reference refidx="12"/> The percentages of lung cancers estimated to be caused by tobacco smoking in males and females are 90% and 78%, respectively. The manufactured cigarette has changed over time, but there is no evidence to suggest that changes such as “low tar” or “low nicotine” cigarettes have resulted in reduced lung cancer risks.<Reference refidx="8"/>  Cigarette smoking is the most important contributor to the lung cancer burden because of its high prevalence of use and because cigarette smokers tend to smoke frequently, but cigar and pipe smoking have also been associated independently in case-control and cohort studies with increased lung cancer risk.<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/> The cigar risks are of particular concern because of the increased prevalence of cigar use in the United States.<Reference refidx="16"/></Para><Para id="_231">The development of lung cancer is the culmination of multistep carcinogenesis. Genetic damage caused by chronic exposure to carcinogens, such as  those in cigarette smoke, is the driving force behind the multistep process. Evidence of genetic damage is the association of cigarette smoking with the formation of the DNA adducts in human lung tissue. A strong link between tobacco smoke and lung carcinogenesis has been established by molecular data.<Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/> </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_232"><Title>Secondhand tobacco smoke</Title><Para id="_233">Secondhand tobacco smoke is also an established cause of lung cancer.<Reference refidx="19"/> Secondhand smoke has the same components as inhaled mainstream smoke, though in lower absolute concentrations, between 1% and 10% depending on the constituent. Elevated biomarkers of tobacco exposure, including urinary cotinine, urinary NNK metabolites, and carcinogen-protein adducts, are seen in those who are exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke.<Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_234"><Title>Family history</Title><Para id="_235">A positive family history of lung cancer is a risk factor for lung cancer.

Many lung carcinogens have been identified in studies of high occupational exposures. Considered in total, occupational exposures have been estimated to account for approximately 10% of lung cancers.<Reference refidx="26"/> These carcinogens include asbestos, radon, tar and soot (sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), arsenic, chromium, nickel, beryllium, and cadmium.<Reference refidx="27"/> For many of these workplace carcinogens, cigarette smoking interacts synergistically to increase the risk.<Reference refidx="28"/> In developed countries, workplace exposures to these agents have largely been controlled.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_241"><Title>Radon</Title><Para id="_242">Approximately 10% of all lung cancer deaths and 30% of lung cancer deaths in lifetime nonsmokers are estimated to be attributable to indoor exposure to radon, estimations that are supported by a meta-analysis and pooled-analyses of case-control studies of lung cancer and indoor radon exposure.<Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/> Due to a synergistic interaction between cigarette smoking and radon exposure, the radon-associated risk of lung cancer among smokers is considerably greater than for nonsmokers.<Reference refidx="31"/> The prevention strategy for residents of homes with high radon concentrations is to have the basement sealed to prevent radon gas from leaking into the home.<Reference refidx="32"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_243"><Title>Air pollution</Title><Para id="_244">Although early evidence from case-control and cohort studies did not support an association between air pollution and lung cancer, the evidence now points to a genuine association.<Reference refidx="33"/> In particular, two prospective cohort studies provide evidence to  suggest that air pollution is weakly associated with the risk of lung cancer.  In an extended follow-up of a study of six U.S. cities, the adjusted relative risk (RR) of lung cancer mortality for each 10 µg/m<Superscript>3</Superscript> increase in concentration of fine-particulate was 1.27 (95% CI,  0.96–1.69).<Reference refidx="34"/>  Using data from the American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study II, it was observed that compared with the least polluted areas, residence in areas with high sulfate concentrations was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (adjusted RR = 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.7) after adjustment for occupational exposures and the factors mentioned above.<Reference refidx="35"/>	In a subsequent update to this report, the risk of lung cancer was observed to increase 14% for each 10 μg/m<Superscript>3</Superscript> increase in concentration of fine particles.<Reference refidx="36"/> The evidence indicating an association between constituents of ambient air pollution and increased lung cancer mortality continues to strengthen, with reports from Asia,<Reference refidx="37"/><Reference refidx="38"/> New Zealand,<Reference refidx="39"/> and Europe,<Reference refidx="40"/> documenting increased risks with exposure to certain components of particulate matter.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_245"><Title>Factors of uncertain  association with risk</Title><SummarySection id="_246"><Title>Dietary factors</Title><Para id="_247">The results of many case-control and prospective cohort studies show that individuals with high dietary intake of fruits or vegetables have a lower risk of lung cancer than those with low fruit or vegetable intake.<Reference refidx="41"/> In a systematic review of the evidence, the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) rates the evidence as “limited suggestive” that nonstarchy vegetable consumption decreases lung cancer risk and “probable” that fruit consumption and foods containing carotenoids decrease lung cancer risk.   However, a subsequent systematic review and meta-analysis limited to prospective studies that adjusted for cigarette smoking found the evidence for carotenoids to be equivocal.<Reference refidx="42"/> </Para><Para id="_248">While the focus has been on fruit and vegetable consumption and micronutrients, a wide range of dietary and anthropometric factors have been investigated.

Avoidance of tobacco use is the most effective measure to prevent lung cancer.

Based on a synthesis of the results of 110 randomized trials, nicotine replacement therapy treatments, alone or in combination, improve cessation rates over placebos after 6 months (RR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.50–1.66).<Reference refidx="58"/> Since the AHCPR guidelines were published, additional evidence of the effectiveness of such pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation has been published.<Reference refidx="59"/><Reference refidx="60"/><Reference refidx="61"/> The choice of therapy should be individualized based on a number of factors, including past experience, preference, and potential agent side effects.

Health indicators including respiratory systems, sensory symptoms, and hospital admissions were reported as outcomes in 25 studies.  With respect to health outcomes, a consistent finding was reduced hospital admissions for cardiac events. Evidence suggested that smoke-free workplace legislation may also result in reduced prevalence of active cigarette smoking; for example, one study observed a 32% decreased smoking prevalence in a county that enacted smoke-free workplace legislation compared with a 2.8% decrease in nearby counties with no smoke-free workplace legislation.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_266"><Title>Preventing occupational exposure to lung carcinogens</Title><Para id="_267">After cigarette smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke, occupational exposure to lung carcinogens, such as asbestos, arsenic, nickel, and chromium, is the most important contributor to the lung cancer burden. When occupational exposure to lung carcinogens are all considered together, 9% to 15% of all lung cancer deaths can be attributed to occupational exposure to lung carcinogens.<Reference refidx="8"/>  Reducing or eliminating workplace exposures to known lung carcinogens would be expected to result in a corresponding decrease in the risk of lung cancer.  Consequently, the proportion of the lung cancer burden attributable to occupational exposures is declining over time in countries like the United States that have taken steps to protect the workforce from exposure to known lung carcinogens.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_268"><Title>Interventions Associated With Increased Risk of Lung Cancer</Title><SummarySection id="_269"><Title>Beta-carotene supplementation in smokers</Title><Para id="_270">Results of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) trial were first
published in  1994.<Reference refidx="65"/>  This trial included 29,133 Finnish male chronic
smokers aged 50 to 69 years in a 2 x 2 factorial design of alpha-tocopherol (50
mg/day) and beta-carotene (20 mg/day).  Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the following four
groups for 5 to 8 years: beta-carotene alone, alpha-tocopherol alone, beta-carotene plus
alpha-tocopherol, or placebo.  Subjects receiving beta-carotene (alone or with alpha-tocopherol) had a higher incidence of lung cancer
(RR = 1.18; 95% CI, 1.03–1.36) and higher
total mortality (RR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01–1.16).  This effect appeared to be
associated with heavier smoking (one or more packs/day) and alcohol intake
(at least one drink/day).<Reference refidx="66"/> Supplementation with
alpha-tocopherol produced no overall effect on lung cancer (RR = 0.99; 95% CI,
0.87–1.13). </Para><Para id="_271">In  1996, the results of the U.S. Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial
(CARET) were published.<Reference refidx="67"/>  This multicenter trial involved 18,314
smokers, former smokers, and asbestos-exposed workers who were randomly assigned to
beta-carotene (at a higher dose than the ATBC trial, 30 mg/day) plus retinyl
palmitate (25,000 IU/day) or placebo.  The primary endpoint was lung cancer
incidence.  The trial was terminated early by the Data Monitoring Committee and NCI because its results confirmed the ATBC finding of a harmful
effect of beta-carotene over that of placebo, which increased lung cancer incidence
(RR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.04–1.57) and total mortality (RR = 1.17; 95% CI, 
1.03–1.33).
In a follow-up study of CARET participants after  the intervention discontinued, these effects attenuated for a period of time.  After 6 years of postintervention follow-up, the postintervention RR for lung cancer incidence was 1.12 (95% CI, 0.97–1.31) and for total mortality was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.99–1.71). During the postintervention phase a larger RR among women, rather than men, emerged for both outcomes in subgroup analyses; the reason for this observation, if reliable, is not known.<Reference refidx="68"/></Para><Para id="_272">The overall findings from the ATBC <Reference refidx="65"/><Reference refidx="66"/> and CARET <Reference refidx="67"/><Reference refidx="69"/> studies, which
include over 47,000 subjects, demonstrated that pharmacological doses of beta-carotene increase lung cancer risk in relatively high-intensity smokers.  The
mechanism of this adverse effect is not known.  Lung cancer risks were not
increased in subsets of moderate-intensity smokers (less than a pack per day)
in the ATBC study, or in former smokers in the CARET study.  Evidence from other studies, such as  the Physicians’ Health Study (PHS),<Reference refidx="70"/> does not indicate that beta-carotene supplementation increases lung cancer risk in
nonsmokers.  Subsequent analyses of participants in these trials and cohorts   suggest that the beneficial outcomes
associated with high beta-carotene plasma levels may be due to increased
dietary intake of fruits and vegetables.  These findings show the importance of
randomized controlled trials to confirm epidemiologic studies.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_273"><Title>Interventions With Adequate Evidence That They Do Not Reduce Risk</Title><SummarySection id="_274"><Title>Chemoprevention</Title><Para id="_275">Studies have examined whether it is possible to prevent cancer development in
the lung  using chemopreventive agents. 
Chemoprevention is defined as the use of specific natural or synthetic chemical
agents to reverse, suppress, or prevent carcinogenesis before the development
of invasive malignancy.   So far, agents tested for efficacy in lung cancer chemoprevention have been micronutrients, such as beta-carotene and vitamin E.</Para><SummarySection id="_276"><Title>Beta-carotene supplementation in nonsmokers</Title><Para id="_277">Two other randomized controlled trials of beta-carotene were carried out in populations that were not at excess risk of lung cancer. The PHS was designed to study the effects
of beta-carotene and aspirin in cancer and cardiovascular disease.  The study
is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial begun in 1982 involving
22,071 male physicians aged 40 to 84 years. After 12 years of follow-up,
beta-carotene was not associated  with  overall risk of cancer (RR = 0.98) or 
lung cancer among current (11% of study population) or former (39% of study
population) smokers.<Reference refidx="70"/></Para><Para id="_278">In the Women’s Health Study (WHS) approximately 40,000 female health professionals were randomly assigned to 50 mg beta carotene on alternate days or placebo.  After a median of 2.1 years of beta-carotene treatment and 2 additional years of follow-up, there was no evidence that beta-carotene protected against lung cancer, as there were more lung cancer cases observed in the beta-carotene (n = 30) than placebo (n = 21) group.<Reference refidx="71"/> The strong evidence from rigorous randomized, placebo-controlled trials clearly indicate that beta-carotene supplementation does not lower the risk of lung cancer in populations that are not high-risk for lung cancer.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_279"><Title>Vitamin E supplementation</Title><Para id="_280">The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) trial began in 1993 and continued follow-up as the HOPE-The Ongoing Outcomes (HOPE-TOO) through 2003.  In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients aged 55 years or older with vascular disease or diabetes were assigned to 400 IU vitamin E or placebo.  With a median follow-up of 7 years, the group randomly assigned to vitamin E had a significantly lower lung cancer incidence rate (1.4%) than the placebo group (2.0%) (RR = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.53–0.98).<Reference refidx="72"/>  However, the protective association between vitamin E supplements and lung cancer in the HOPE-TOO study needs to be interpreted in the context of evidence from other randomized trials.  In the ATBC study, supplementation with alpha-tocopherol produced no overall effect on lung cancer (RR = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.87–1.13). In the WHS of 40,000 female health professionals, using 600 IU of vitamin E every other day showed no evidence of protection against lung cancer in women (RR = 1.09; 95% CI, 0.83–1.44).<Reference refidx="73"/> The  Medical Research Council/British Heart Foundation   Heart Protection Study (HPS) is a randomized placebo-controlled trial to test antioxidant vitamin supplementation with vitamin E, vitamin C, and beta-carotene among 20,536 United Kingdom adults with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes.  The trial began recruitment in 1994, and as of the 2001 follow-up the results showed a slightly higher rate of lung cancer in the vitamin group compared with the placebo group (1.6% vs. 1.4%, respectively).<Reference refidx="74"/></Para><Para id="_281">Looking at the vitamin E results for the ATBC, HPS, and HOPE-TOO studies combined, the summary odds ratio was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.87–1.08),<Reference refidx="72"/> and adding the results from the WHS to this would bring the association even closer to the null.   The combined evidence for vitamin E supplementation thus continues to be consistent with no effect on lung cancer risk.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">American Cancer Society: Cancer Facts and Figures 2015.
