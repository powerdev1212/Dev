It consists of a specialized <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044660">diet</GlossaryTermRef> to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000446105">“detoxify”</GlossaryTermRef> the body and rebuild the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356">immune system</GlossaryTermRef>, adding <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044744">vitamin</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045787">mineral</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000373932">supplements</GlossaryTermRef> to help in these processes.  Coffee <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044204">enemas</GlossaryTermRef> are an essential part of the regimen.   The therapy is named for its developer, Max Gerson, a German <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000390246">physician</GlossaryTermRef> who emigrated to the United States and started a medical practice in New York City in 1938.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_11">The Gerson therapy is rooted in the belief that cancer is a disease of the whole <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046250">organism</GlossaryTermRef>, the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumor</GlossaryTermRef> being only a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045022">symptom</GlossaryTermRef> of a diseased body. Gerson considered cancer to be an accumulation of several damaging factors that combine to cause the deterioration of the entire <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044056">metabolic</GlossaryTermRef> system.  The goal of the Gerson therapy is to bring the body back to its normal metabolic state, or as near to this state as possible, and to keep the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046173">metabolism</GlossaryTermRef> in natural equilibrium.<Reference refidx="1"/> 
<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_12">Gerson observed that cancer patients exhibited markedly degenerated <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000257523">organs</GlossaryTermRef>, especially the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046312">liver</GlossaryTermRef>, presumably caused by the clearing of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043986">toxic</GlossaryTermRef> materials of an unknown type that the disease produced. He also noted that the situation became worse after <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045214">chemotherapy</GlossaryTermRef>, probably because of more toxic products entering the bloodstream.   Gerson’s regimen focused on helping the liver rid the body of toxic substances while restoring and maintaining healthy liver function.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_13">According to Gerson, during the detoxification process that results from the Gerson diet, the liver becomes progressively overburdened as the body rids itself of toxic substances formed by the breakdown of cancer cells. Coffee enemas, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046704">pancreatic enzymes</GlossaryTermRef>, and crude liver <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000407760">extract</GlossaryTermRef> are used to help the liver deal with the burden of removing toxic substances.<Reference refidx="1"/> 
<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_14">Total control of everything that enters and leaves the body is the governing principle of the Gerson regimen.  Its three main components are strict diet, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463726">nutritional supplements</GlossaryTermRef>, and regular enemas.   </Para><Para id="_15">The diet is strictly vegetarian for at least 6 weeks and consists of specific fruits and vegetables, eaten either raw or stewed in their own juices. No animal <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046092">protein</GlossaryTermRef> is allowed. Some whole grains such as oatmeal are included.  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000285920">Flaxseed</GlossaryTermRef> oil is allowed only because it aids in the body’s use of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045248">vitamin A</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="2"/>  No other fat such as cooking oil and no salt or spices of any kind are allowed. A glass of freshly prepared juice from vegetables and fruits must be consumed every hour for 13 hours throughout the day.  The vegetables and fruits used on the diet are very high in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044344">potassium</GlossaryTermRef> and very low in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044731">sodium</GlossaryTermRef>. 
</Para><Para id="_16">Food preparation is also controlled.   Food may be prepared only in cast-iron pots and pans; no aluminum cookware is allowed.  Juices must be prepared using a specific type of juicer that crushes the fruit or vegetable rather than grinding it into pulp. Gerson advocated organically produced food, with all fruits, vegetables, and grains grown and raised in soil free of pesticides and contaminants and enriched only with natural fertilizers.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_17">The protein and dairy restriction may be lifted to include buttermilk; however, this restriction may continue through the entire course of the therapy, depending on the individual patient.   Some changes in the original diet have occurred over time, but the initiation phase of the diet has always been a vegetarian diet.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_18">Taking specific vitamin and mineral supplements plus pancreatic enzymes is the second component of the regimen.  Although there have been additions and substitutions to the basic list of supplements, there have been few changes since the 1940s.  The typical range of supplements includes the following:     </Para><OrderedList id="_19" Style="LAlpha"><ListItem>Potassium solution</ListItem><ListItem>Lugol’s solution (potassium iodide, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044548">iodine</GlossaryTermRef>, water)</ListItem><ListItem>Injectable crude liver extract (no longer used) with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000390323">vitamin B12</GlossaryTermRef> 
		(substitution: <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000346488">coenzyme Q10</GlossaryTermRef> and vitamin B12)

Lugol’s solution, which consists of 5 g of iodine and 10 g of potassium iodide dissolved in water, is given to increase the body’s metabolic rate.  The potassium solution and Lugol’s solution are both added to the hourly juice intake.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>  
</Para><Para id="_21">Originally, Gerson thought that using crude liver extract and juice (made by processing fresh calf and veal livers) would help maintain liver function.  The extract and juice were given to patients via <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044678">injection</GlossaryTermRef> with the vitamin B12.   In 1989, the use of injectable crude liver extract was banned by the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454785">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</GlossaryTermRef> because it was found to be contaminated with <ScientificName>Campylobacter</ScientificName>.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>  Desiccated liver <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000455334">capsules</GlossaryTermRef> replaced the crude extract, but this has now been replaced by coenzyme Q10.<Reference refidx="2"/>  As mentioned above, flaxseed oil is used to help the body utilize vitamin A.   Pancreatic enzymes are given to assist in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463707">digestion</GlossaryTermRef> and the elimination of the breakdown products in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046462">colon</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para><Para id="_22">Coffee (or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462671">chamomile</GlossaryTermRef>) enemas are the third component of the Gerson therapy.     Coffee enemas supposedly <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000257207">dilate</GlossaryTermRef> the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046738">bile duct</GlossaryTermRef> in the liver, thereby allowing the liver to release the breakdown products more easily and speed their removal to the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046335">intestine</GlossaryTermRef>.  At the beginning of therapy, a patient may take four or more coffee enemas per day.  Literature suggests that coffee enemas help relieve the pain associated with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045692">gastrointestinal</GlossaryTermRef> cancers; however, there is only anecdotal evidence to suggest that the enemas actually dilate the bile ducts.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_23">Central to the therapy is an abundance of potassium and the lack of sodium.  Gerson had observed that as soon as his cancer patients started on the diet regimen, they released large amounts of sodium in their <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046642">urine</GlossaryTermRef>. He noticed that cells in the patients’ bodies that had been bloated with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044669">fluid</GlossaryTermRef> started to shrink as the fluid was released.<Reference refidx="1"/>  After studying the research in cancer cell biology available to him at the time and noting the ratio of potassium to sodium in cancer cells versus healthy cells, he deduced that the reason for this sodium excretion was that the diet regimen was correcting generalized <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissue</GlossaryTermRef> damage caused by excess sodium.  Healthy cells had a high ratio of potassium to sodium; diseased cells had a low ratio of potassium to sodium or an abundance of sodium.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_24">The implications of this observation led Gerson to believe that part of the process of recovery from cancer was the replacement of excess sodium by potassium in damaged tissues.<Reference refidx="8"/> This belief is the theoretical basis for Gerson’s choice of high-potassium, low-sodium fruits and vegetables in his <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044711">prescribed</GlossaryTermRef> diet: a high intake of potassium was needed to restore a normal ratio of potassium to sodium in the cell. </Para><Para id="_25">The Gerson therapy is the basis for other <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044384">CAM</GlossaryTermRef> therapies that include cleansing enemas or special diets as part of their regimens, most notably the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000305991">Gonzalez regimen</GlossaryTermRef>.

In 1938, after passing the New York state medical board examinations, he started a practice in New York City.  While in Germany, Gerson had suffered from severe migraine headaches and developed a vegetarian <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044660">diet</GlossaryTermRef> as a way to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000318813">cure</GlossaryTermRef> his migraines.  The diet was based on his study of the history of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000482419">medicine</GlossaryTermRef> and his respect for the writings of Paracelsus (1490–1541), who said that diet must be the basis of medical <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044737">therapy</GlossaryTermRef>; however, Gerson noted that diet is only one part of a treatment <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045864">regimen</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="1"/> The special diet cured his migraines, and after seeing its success in one of his patients suffering from lupus vulgaris, he <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044711">prescribed</GlossaryTermRef> the diet for others suffering from the same disease.  He conducted a successful <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045961">clinical trial</GlossaryTermRef> in Germany using the vegetarian diet.<Reference refidx="1"/> His most noted patient was the wife of Albert Schweitzer, M.D., whom he reported curing.  The accolades he received from Dr. Schweitzer may have persuaded the medical community to seriously consider the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000446537">Gerson therapy</GlossaryTermRef> and perhaps led to Gerson’s 1946 appearance with five of his patients before a congressional committee considering a bill to increase funding for cancer research.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_37">When Gerson began prescribing his regimen for patients, he did not consider his therapy a cure for cancer.   At that time he wrote that there was no conclusive evidence from his work that cancer was influenced by diet; however, he did think that diet was a useful supportive measure.<Reference refidx="3"/> In 1958, after treating patients with his regimen for more than 15 years, Gerson published his complete theory, including the results of 50 cases. He started referring to his regimen as an “effective treatment for cancer, even in advanced cases.”<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_38">The practice of changing diet or fasting to cure or ameliorate the effects of disease has a long history, as does the practice of giving <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044204">enemas</GlossaryTermRef> to flush the body, thus keeping the body clear of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046622">toxins</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="5"/> There  are  no reported results of clinical trials examining the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000346517">efficacy</GlossaryTermRef> of either of these practices in the treatment of cancer or how these practices would affect a treatment.  Evolving evidence supports the idea that a plant-based diet plays a role in cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000439419">prevention</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para><Para id="_39">Gerson theorized that the use of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046704">pancreatic enzymes</GlossaryTermRef> would reduce demands on the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046312">liver</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046254">pancreas</GlossaryTermRef>, already in a weakened state, to manufacture the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046081">enzymes</GlossaryTermRef> necessary to convert food into usable <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044697">nutrients</GlossaryTermRef>; this would help stabilize the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044698">nutritional</GlossaryTermRef> needs of the body while it undergoes the detoxification process.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="6"/>   Gerson’s therapy was widely considered impossible because it was thought that pancreatic enzymes were reduced to their components in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044046">intestinal</GlossaryTermRef> tract.  However, it has been reported that these enzymes are not broken down but are released into the bloodstream and used again in the digestive process.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_40">Controversy about the efficacy of the Gerson therapy continued throughout Gerson’s life.   In 1946 and 1949, two articles in the Journal of the American Medical Association concluded that the treatment was of no value.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/> The <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044266">National Cancer Institute</GlossaryTermRef> (NCI) reviewed Gerson’s data from ten case histories in 1947 and 50 case histories in 1959.  NCI concluded that in most cases, basic criteria for evaluating clinical benefit were not met.  NCI concluded that the data demonstrated no benefit.<Reference refidx="2"/>  In 1972, the American Cancer Society (ACS) published a statement summarizing the negative assessments of Gerson’s treatment.<Reference refidx="11"/> Another statement published by ACS in 1991 concerned various “<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044056">metabolic</GlossaryTermRef> therapies” (defined as treatments that depend on changing <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046173">metabolism</GlossaryTermRef> through diet, enemas, and supplements given at clinics in Tijuana, Mexico) and reemphasized the lack of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044724">scientific</GlossaryTermRef> evidence on the efficacy of the Gerson regimen.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_41">Gerson died in 1959, leaving behind no systematic way to continue offering his treatment.  His malpractice insurance had been canceled in 1953, and in 1958 he was suspended for 2 years from the New York County Medical Society.<Reference refidx="11"/> In 1977, his daughter, Charlotte Gerson Straus, who had continued to lecture widely about the Gerson therapy, cofounded the Gerson Institute with Norman Fritz.  Located in San Diego, the Gerson Institute does not own or operate treatment facilities but maintains a licensing program for treatment centers such as the Centro Hospitalario Internacional Pacifico and Mexico’s Center for Integrative Medicine and the Gerson Hospital (CHIPSA) in Baja California, Mexico. CHIPSA refers to Max Gerson as the founder of “immunonutrition,” their term for Gerson’s idea of cleansing the body while building up the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356">immune system</GlossaryTermRef> through diet and supplementation.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Gerson M: A Cancer Therapy: Results of Fifty Cases and The Cure of Advanced Cancer by Diet Therapy.

Gerson’s published cases encompass a variety of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef> types.

Although some attempt at <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044671">follow-up</GlossaryTermRef> is made, it is not systematic and consists chiefly of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043995">anecdotal reports</GlossaryTermRef> and conversations with patients by mail or phone.   
</Para><Para id="_43">A preliminary study conducted between 1983 and 1984 attempted to collect any available retrospective data on three nonallopathic treatments offered in clinics in Tijuana, Mexico: Gerson, Hoxsey, and Contreras.<Reference refidx="5"/>   The authors did not have access to medical records and relied on patient interviews for all information.  The self-reporting was incomplete and inconsistent, lacking precise information in areas such as how far the disease had advanced.  In the Gerson segment, only 18 of the 38 patients stayed in the study for 5 years or until they died; their <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000285973">mean</GlossaryTermRef> survival was 9 months from the beginning of the study. The other 20 patients were lost to follow-up.  At 5 years, 17 of the 18 had died, and one patient with advanced <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045148">non-Hodgkin lymphoma</GlossaryTermRef>  was alive but not disease free. Overall, this study did not offer meaningful data to support the clinical efficacy of the approaches studied.</Para><Para id="_44">A 1990 noncontrolled, self-selected, matched-pairs study conducted in Austria used a diet regimen based on the Gerson therapy to evaluate diet as an adjuvant to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045570">surgery</GlossaryTermRef>.

Each of the two groups was divided into a diet group and a nondiet group.  All patients continued with whatever <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044711">prescribed</GlossaryTermRef> conventional regimen was required after their surgery.  Results in the matched pairs with colorectal cancer showed an increased survival time in three of the nine patients in the diet group (28.6 months) as compared with four of the nine patients (16.2 months) in the nondiet group. In the breast cancer matched pairs, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046580">side effects</GlossaryTermRef> of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045214">chemotherapy</GlossaryTermRef> and pain and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045843">pleural effusion</GlossaryTermRef> were lower in the diet group.

Of the 14 stage I–II patients, all were disease-free at 17 years posttreatment; however, this number was too small for a statistical comparison with other cohorts.  For stage III patients, the 5-year survival rate was 71% compared with rates of 27% to 42% reported in the literature.  The stage IV patients had the largest survival advantage.  The 5-year survival rate for these 18 patients was 39%, compared with 6% in the published literature.
