because the leukemic cells of more than 95% of patients have a distinctive
cytogenetic abnormality, the Philadelphia  chromosome (Ph1).<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>  The Ph1
 results from a reciprocal translocation between the long arms of
chromosomes 9 and 22 and is demonstrable in all hematopoietic precursors.<Reference refidx="4"/> 
This translocation results in the transfer of the Abelson (ABL) on chromosome 9 oncogene to an
area of chromosome 22 termed the breakpoint cluster region (<GeneName>BCR</GeneName>).<Reference refidx="4"/>  This, in
turn, results in a fused <GeneName>BCR/ABL</GeneName> gene and in the production of an abnormal
tyrosine kinase protein that causes the disordered myelopoiesis found in CML. 
Furthermore, these molecular techniques can now be used to supplement
cytogenetic studies to detect the presence of the 9;22 translocation in
patients without a visible Ph1 (Ph1-negative).  

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_381"><Title>Prognosis and Survival</Title><Para id="_382">Ph1-negative CML is a poorly defined
entity that is less clearly distinguished from other myeloproliferative
syndromes.  Patients with Ph1-negative CML generally have a poorer response to treatment
and shorter survival than Ph1-positive patients.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Ph1-negative patients who have <GeneName>BCR/ABL</GeneName>
gene rearrangement detectable by Southern blot analysis, however,  have prognoses
equivalent to Ph1-positive patients.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_383"><Title>Diagnosis</Title><Para id="_78">  A small subset of patients have <GeneName>BCR/ABL</GeneName>
detectable only by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR),
which is the most sensitive technique currently available.  Patients with RT–PCR evidence of the <GeneName>BCR/ABL</GeneName> fusion gene appear clinically and prognostically
identical to patients with a classic Ph1; however, patients who are
<GeneName>BCR/ABL</GeneName>-negative by RT–PCR have a clinical course more consistent with chronic
myelomonocytic leukemia, which is a distinct clinical entity related to myelodysplastic
syndrome.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/>  Fluorescent <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> hybridization  of the <GeneName>BCR/ABL</GeneName> translocation can be performed on the bone marrow aspirate or on the peripheral blood of patients with CML.<Reference refidx="10"/>

</Para><Para id="_178">At the time of diagnosis of patients with CML, splenomegaly is the most common finding on physical examination.<Reference refidx="10"/>  The spleen may be enormous, filling most of the abdomen and
presenting a significant clinical problem, or the spleen may be only minimally
enlarged.  In about 10% of patients, the spleen is neither palpable nor
enlarged on splenic scan.
</Para><Para id="_86">The median age of patients with Ph1-positive CML is 67 years.<Reference refidx="11"/> While the median survival used to be 4 to 6 years, with the advent of the new oral therapies, the median survival is expected to approach normal life expectancy for most patients, although it is still too soon to say this definitively.

</Para><Para id="_9">Histopathologic examination of bone marrow aspirate demonstrates a shift in the
myeloid series to immature forms that increase in number as patients progress
to the blastic phase of the disease.  The marrow is hypercellular, and
differential counts of both marrow and blood show a spectrum of mature and
immature granulocytes similar to that found in normal marrow.  Increased
numbers of eosinophils or basophils are often present, and sometimes
monocytosis is seen.  Increased megakaryocytes are often found in the marrow,
and sometimes fragments of megakaryocytic nuclei are present in the blood,
especially when the platelet count is very high.  The percentage of lymphocytes
is reduced in both the marrow and blood in comparison with normal subjects, and
the myeloid/erythroid ratio in the marrow is usually greatly elevated.  The
leukocyte alkaline phosphatase enzyme is either absent or markedly reduced in
the neutrophils of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).<Reference refidx="1"/>
