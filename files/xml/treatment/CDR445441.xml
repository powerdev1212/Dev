The National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine offers national certification examinations for practitioners of acupuncture and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449722">traditional Chinese medicine</GlossaryTermRef> (TCM) (<ExternalRef xref="http://www.nccaom.org/">www.nccaom.org</ExternalRef>); most, but not all, states require this certification. More than 50 schools and colleges of acupuncture and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449739">Oriental medicine</GlossaryTermRef> operate in the United States, many of which offer master’s-level programs and are accredited by or have been granted candidacy status by the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM). ACAOM standards for a master's-level degree require a 3-year program (approximately 2,000 hours of study) for acupuncture and a 4-year program for Oriental medicine, which includes acupuncture and herbal therapy (<ExternalRef xref="http://www.acaom.org/">www.ACAOM.org</ExternalRef>).  In recent years, some schools have begun to offer programs for Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine with an additional 1,200 hours of clinical-based doctoral training. Some Western medical training, including the study of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000467828">anatomy</GlossaryTermRef>, physiology, and clean-needle technique is included in the curriculums of these schools. Postgraduate training programs in medical acupuncture for <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000390246">physicians</GlossaryTermRef> also exist. In the United States, training to be a licensed acupuncturist  is regulated according to individual state law. Because the educational and licensing requirements for acupuncture practice vary from state to state, one should inquire from each state board of acupuncture (or other relevant board) for particular information (<ExternalRef xref="http://www.nccaom.org/">www.nccaom.org</ExternalRef>). Third-party reimbursements also vary from state to state.   Some insurance companies cover acupuncture or limited acupuncture treatment.  Federal payers such as  Medicare do not generally reimburse for acupuncture treatment. </Para><Para id="_12">Acupuncture has been practiced in China and other Asian countries for more than 4,000 years.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/> In China, acupuncture is part of a TCM system of traditional medical knowledge and is practiced along with other treatment <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000270868">modalities</GlossaryTermRef> such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000462683">herbal medicine</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454783">tui na</GlossaryTermRef> (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454761">massage</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046723">acupressure</GlossaryTermRef>), <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000467850">mind/body exercise</GlossaryTermRef> (e.g., <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000467860">qigong</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000467869">tai chi</GlossaryTermRef>), and dietary therapy.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/> In the United States, several different acupuncture styles are practiced in addition to TCM. These include Japanese acupuncture (e.g., <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449744">meridian</GlossaryTermRef> therapy), English acupuncture (e.g., <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000467839">five element or traditional acupuncture</GlossaryTermRef>), French acupuncture (e.g., French energetic acupuncture), Korean acupuncture (e.g., <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000467834">constitutional acupuncture</GlossaryTermRef>), and American medical acupuncture. Most of these are derived from ancient Chinese medical philosophy and practices. All are based on the view that the human body must be perceived and treated as a whole and as part of nature; health is the result of harmony among bodily functions and between the body and nature, and disease occurs when this harmony is disrupted. TCM <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043985">therapeutic</GlossaryTermRef> interventions, including acupuncture are used to restore the state of harmony.</Para><Para id="_13">Acupuncture is closely associated with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449742">Chinese meridian theory</GlossaryTermRef>.  According to this theory, there are 12 primary meridians, or channels, and eight additional meridians, each following a particular directional course along the body.  A <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046649">vital</GlossaryTermRef> energy known as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454782">qi</GlossaryTermRef> flows through these meridians and participates in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000467842">homeostatic</GlossaryTermRef> regulation of various bodily functions.  Along the meridians are approximately 360 points that serve as both <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454769">pathognomonic</GlossaryTermRef> signs of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000407758">disorder</GlossaryTermRef> and as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000460162">loci</GlossaryTermRef> for acupuncture treatments.<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="17"/> When the normal flow of energy over a meridian is obstructed (e.g., as a result of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissue</GlossaryTermRef> injury or a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumor</GlossaryTermRef>), pain or other symptoms result. Chinese medicine proposes that the purpose of acupuncture therapy is to normalize energy flow, thereby relieving the symptoms by stimulating specific sites (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449727">acupuncture points</GlossaryTermRef>) on the meridians.<Reference refidx="18"/>  In acupuncture treatment, stainless steel needles, usually ranging from 0.22 mm to 0.25 mm in 
<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044224">diameter,</GlossaryTermRef> are inserted into relevant acupuncture points to stimulate the affected meridians. A <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449723">needling</GlossaryTermRef> sensation known as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000467835">de qi sensation</GlossaryTermRef> occurs, in which the patient may feel heaviness, numbness, or tingling during an acupuncture treatment. Length and frequency of treatment vary according to the condition being treated.  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045641">Chronic</GlossaryTermRef> conditions usually require a longer treatment period. Typically, two or three 
sessions per week are required initially and may decrease to once a week after several weeks of treatment. Needles are typically left in place for 15 to 30 minutes after insertion, and their effects may be augmented with manual or electrical stimulation and/or heat (e.g., <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449724">moxibustion</GlossaryTermRef> or heat lamps).</Para><Para id="_15">Classical techniques of acupuncture include needling, moxibustion, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449725">cupping</GlossaryTermRef>. Acupressure,  using fingers or mechanical <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000635288">devices</GlossaryTermRef> to apply pressure on acupuncture points is based on the same principles as acupuncture. Moxibustion is a method in which an herb (<ScientificName>Artemisia vulgaris</ScientificName>) is burned above the skin or on an acupuncture point for the purpose of warming it to alleviate symptoms.  Cupping promotes <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000270735">blood</GlossaryTermRef> circulation and stimulates acupuncture points by creating a vacuum or negative pressure on the surface of the skin.<Reference refidx="18"/> During the past several decades, various new auxiliary devices have been developed.  Acupuncture devices such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000269415">electroacupuncture</GlossaryTermRef> (EA) machines and heat lamps are commonly used to enhance the effects of acupuncture.</Para><Para id="_16">In addition to classical acupuncture techniques, other techniques have been developed and are sometimes used in cancer management.  These include <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449745">trigger point acupuncture</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000467844">laser acupuncture</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000467825">acupuncture point injection</GlossaryTermRef>, and techniques focusing on particular regions of the body: <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449817">auricular</GlossaryTermRef> acupuncture, scalp acupuncture, face acupuncture, hand acupuncture, nose acupuncture, and foot acupuncture. Of these, auricular acupuncture is the most commonly used.</Para><Para id="_138">In clinical practice, most acupuncturists in the United States   follow the traditional theories and principles of Chinese medicine. However, there are other schools of acupuncture practice, including medical acupuncture, which have different theories regarding meridians and acupuncture point locations.</Para><Para id="_17">Although acupuncture has been practiced for millennia, it has come under scientific investigation only recently.   In 1976, the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454785">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</GlossaryTermRef> (FDA) classified <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449728">acupuncture needles</GlossaryTermRef> as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044763">investigational</GlossaryTermRef> devices (Class III) (<ExternalRef xref="http://www.fda.gov/">www.fda.gov</ExternalRef>), resulting in a number of research studies on the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture.<Reference refidx="19"/>  In November 1994, the Office of Alternative Medicine (the predecessor of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454777">National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine</GlossaryTermRef>) at the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044268">National Institutes of Health</GlossaryTermRef> (NIH) sponsored an NIH-FDA workshop on the status of acupuncture needle usage. Two years later, the FDA reclassified acupuncture needles as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449732">medical devices</GlossaryTermRef> (Class II) without, however, giving specific indications for their use.<Reference refidx="20"/>    In 1997, NIH held a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000467833">Consensus Development Conference</GlossaryTermRef> on Acupuncture to evaluate its safety and efficacy. The 12-member panel concluded that promising research results showing the efficacy of acupuncture in certain conditions have emerged and that further research is likely to uncover additional areas in which acupuncture intervention will be useful. The panel stated that “there is clear evidence that needle acupuncture treatment is effective for <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043980">postoperative</GlossaryTermRef> and chemotherapy N/V.”  It also stated that there are “a number of other pain-related conditions for which acupuncture may be effective as an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000467826">adjunct therapy</GlossaryTermRef>, an acceptable alternative, or as part of a comprehensive treatment program,” and it agreed that further research is likely to uncover additional areas in which acupuncture intervention will be useful.<Reference refidx="19"/></Para><Para id="_18">These actions by the FDA and NIH have resulted in the establishment of a number of active programs of research into the mechanisms and efficacy of acupuncture, much of which is, or is potentially, relevant to cancer management. To date, the most extensively investigated aspect of these mechanisms has been the effect of acupuncture on pain management. The NIH Consensus Panel concluded that “acupuncture can cause multiple <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044510">biological</GlossaryTermRef> responses,” local and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000256557">distal</GlossaryTermRef>,      “mediated mainly by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044121">sensory</GlossaryTermRef> neurons…within the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046481">central nervous system</GlossaryTermRef>.”    Acupuncture “may also <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043976">activate</GlossaryTermRef> the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046359">hypothalamus</GlossaryTermRef> and the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046229">pituitary gland</GlossaryTermRef>, resulting in a broad spectrum of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045921">systemic</GlossaryTermRef> effects,” including “alterations in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045823">peptides</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045713">hormones</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000458085">neurotransmitters</GlossaryTermRef> and the regulation of blood flow.”<Reference refidx="19"/> Recent studies show the effect of acupuncture on chronic <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000373080">inflammatory</GlossaryTermRef> pain.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/> Evidence suggests that acupuncture operates through the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000446115">autonomic nervous system</GlossaryTermRef> to balance the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000467867">sympathetic</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000467855">parasympathetic</GlossaryTermRef> systems and suggests that the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044187">anti-inflammatory</GlossaryTermRef> effects of acupuncture are mediated by its electrophysiologic effects on neurotransmitters, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046130">cytokines,</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044064">neuropeptides</GlossaryTermRef>.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="31"/> Many studies provide evidence that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045054">opioid</GlossaryTermRef> peptides are released during acupuncture and that acupuncture <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000449929">analgesia</GlossaryTermRef> is mediated by the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044026">endogenous</GlossaryTermRef> opioid system.<Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/></Para><Para id="_19">Laboratory and animal cancer studies exploring the mechanisms of acupuncture have

For sham control, EA needles were inserted into GB30 without stimulation. Thermal hyperalgesia, a decrease in paw withdrawal latency to a noxious thermal stimulus, and mechanical hyperalgesia, a decrease in paw withdrawal pressure threshold, were measured at baseline and 20 minutes after EA. EA significantly attenuated the hyperalgesia compared with sham control. Moreover, the EA inhibited up-regulation of preprodynorphin mRNA and dynorphin as well as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and its mRNA compared with sham control. Intrathecal injection of antiserum against dynorphin A (1–17) and IL-1 receptor antagonist significantly inhibited the cancer-induced hyperalgesia.

Consistent with the findings from clinical studies of acupuncture on N/V due to other causes such as postoperative N/V and morning sickness, these studies showed acupuncture to be effective in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced N/V.  A well-documented example is discussed below.

The treatment group received acupuncture in combination with radiation therapy or chemotherapy, and the control group was treated with radiation therapy or chemotherapy alone. The data showed that the patients in the acupuncture group gained significantly more body weight than patients in the control group (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001). The acupuncture group also showed greater improvement than the controls in the symptoms of cough, thoracodynia, hemoptysis, and fever for patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000270740">lung</GlossaryTermRef> cancer and the symptoms of chest pain, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046274">mucus</GlossaryTermRef> vomiting, and difficulty in swallowing for patients with esophageal cancer. In addition, the acupuncture group suffered fewer side effects (poor appetite, N/V, dizziness, or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000321374">fatigue</GlossaryTermRef>) from radiation therapy or chemotherapy than the control group. However, no statistical analysis was performed on these data.

The data indicated that the major reasons for referral included pain (53%), xerostomia (32%), hot flashes (6%), and nausea/loss of appetite (6%). Sixty percent of the patients showed at least 30% improvement in their symptoms, and about one-third had no change in the severity of symptoms.
