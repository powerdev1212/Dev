For glioblastoma, combined modality therapy with resection, radiation, and chemotherapy is standard. Anaplastic astrocytomas, anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, and anaplastic oligoastrocytomas represent only a small proportion of CNS gliomas; therefore, phase III randomized trials restricted to these tumor types are not generally practical.   The natural histories of these tumors are variable, depending on histological and molecular factors; therefore, treatment guidelines are evolving.

This practice is based on observational evidence that survival is better in patients who undergo tumor resection than in those who have closed biopsy alone.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/> The benefit of resection has not been tested in randomized trials.

deep-seated tumors such as pontine gliomas, which are diagnosed on

Stereotactic biopsy can be used for lesions that are difficult to reach and
