The infusion of hematopoietic stem cells generally follows a preparative regimen given to the patient consisting of agents designed to do the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_41" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Create marrow space.</ListItem><ListItem>Suppress the patient's immune system to prevent rejection.</ListItem><ListItem>Intensively treat malignant cells in patients with cancer.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_10">HCT is currently used in the following three clinical scenarios:</Para><OrderedList id="_11" Style="Arabic">

It has also been used to attempt to reset the immune system in severe autoimmune disorders.  For autologous transplant to work, the following must apply:</Para><ItemizedList id="_156" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>The higher chemotherapy/radiation therapy dose that can be used because of hematopoietic stem cell support achieves a significantly higher cell kill of the disease. This may include increased tumor kill in areas where standard-dose chemotherapy has less penetration (central nervous system).</ListItem><ListItem>Meaningful percentages of cure or long-term remission from the disease must occur without significant nonhematopoietic toxicities that would otherwise limit the therapeutic benefit achieved.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_371">Current pediatric indications for autologous transplant include patients with certain lymphomas, neuroblastoma, and brain tumors.</Para><Para id="_162">Allogeneic transplant approaches to cancer treatment also may involve high-dose therapy, but because of immunologic differences between the donor and recipient, an additional graft-versus-tumor (GVT) or graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) treatment effect can occur. Although autologous approaches are associated with less short-term mortality, many malignancies are resistant to mega-dose therapy alone and/or involve the bone marrow, thus requiring allogeneic approaches for optimal outcome. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_157"><Title>Determining When HCT Is Indicated: Comparison of HCT and Chemotherapy Outcomes</Title><Para id="_158">Because the outcomes using chemotherapy and HCT treatments have been changing over time, regular comparisons between these approaches should be performed to continually redefine optimal therapy for a given patient.  For some diseases, randomized trials or intent-to-treat using a HLA-matched sibling donor have established the benefit of HCT by direct comparison.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> However, for very high-risk patients such as those with early relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL),  randomized trials have not been feasible because of investigator bias.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/>  </Para><Para id="_372">In general, HCT typically offers benefit only to children at high risk of relapse with standard chemotherapy approaches. Accordingly, treatment schemas that accurately identify these high-risk patients and offer HCT if reasonably HLA-matched donors are available have come to be the preferred approach for many diseases.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Less well-established, higher-risk approaches to HCT are generally reserved for only the very highest-risk patients. However, higher-risk approaches such as haploidentical transplantation are becoming safer and more efficacious and are increasingly being used interchangeably with fully matched allogeneic approaches.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/> (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000700000#_3" url="/types/childhood-cancers/child-hct-hp-pdq">Haploidentical HCT</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information.)</Para><Para id="_159">When comparisons of similar patients treated with HCT or chemotherapy are made in the setting where randomized or intent-to-treat studies are not feasible, the following issues should be considered:    </Para><OrderedList id="_160" Style="Arabic" Compact="No"><ListItem><Strong>Remission/disease status: </Strong>Comparisons between HCT and chemotherapy should include only patients who obtain remission, preferably after similar approaches to salvage therapy, because patients failing to obtain remission do very poorly with any therapy.  To account for time-to-transplant bias, the chemotherapy comparator arm should include only patients who maintained remission until the median time to HCT.  The HCT comparator arm should also include only patients who achieved the initial remission mentioned above and maintained that remission until the time of HCT. High-risk and intermediate-risk patient groups should not be combined because a benefit for HCT in the high-risk group can be masked when outcomes are similar to those achieved in the intermediate-risk group.<Reference refidx="10"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Therapy approaches used for comparison: </Strong>Comparisons should be made with the best or most commonly used chemotherapy and HCT approaches utilized during the time frame under study.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>HCT approach: </Strong>HCT approaches that are very high risk or have documented lower rates of survival should not be combined for analysis with standard-risk HCT approaches.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Criteria for relapse: </Strong>Risk factors for relapse should be carefully defined, and analysis should be based on the most current knowledge of risk.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Selection bias:</Strong>  Attempts should be made to understand and eliminate or correct for selection bias.

Bone marrow can be used for the transplant, but PBSCs have been shown to lead to quicker blood count recovery and less toxicity.  Patients under consideration for autologous HCT are generally given chemotherapy to determine tumor responsiveness and minimize risk of tumor contamination in their bone marrow.  After a number of rounds of chemotherapy, they undergo the apheresis procedure, either as their blood counts recover from chemotherapy or during a break between chemotherapy treatments.  Growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) are used to increase the number of circulating stem and progenitor cells (CD34+ cells).  Collection centers monitor the CD34-positive number in the patient and product each day to determine the best time to begin collection and when collection is complete.  Patients with poorly mobilized  CD34-positive cells can often have their cells successfully collected using alternative mobilization approaches (e.g., plerixafor). The collected PBSCs are cryopreserved for later use. After completion of an intensive preparative regimen using high-dose chemotherapy, which varies according to tumor, the PBSCs are administered back to the patient at the time of transplant.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_166"><Title>General Indications for Autologous Procedures/Preparative Regimens/Tumor Purging</Title><Para id="_169">In pediatrics, the most common autologous transplant indications are the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_373" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>High-risk neuroblastoma.

Given the distance on chromosome 6 between HLA A and HLA DRB1, there is approximately a 1% possibility of a crossover event occurring in a possible sibling match.  Because a crossover event could involve the HLA C antigen and because parents may share HLA antigens that actually differ at the allele level, many centers perform allele-level typing of possible sibling donors at all of the key HLA antigens (HLA A, B, C, and DRB1).  Any related donor that is not a full sibling should have full HLA typing because similar haplotypes from different parents could differ at the allele level.    </Para><Para id="_376">Although single-antigen mismatched related donors (5/6 antigen matched) have been used interchangeably with matched sibling donors in some studies, a large Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) study in pediatric HCT recipients showed that use of 5/6 antigen matched related donors who are not siblings results in rates of GVHD and overall survival equivalent to rates in 8/8 allele level matched unrelated donors and slightly inferior survival than in fully matched siblings.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_25"><Title>HLA matching considerations for unrelated donors</Title><Para id="_26">Optimal outcomes are achieved in unrelated allogeneic marrow transplantation when the pairs of antigens at HLA A, B, C, and DRB1 are matched between the donor and the recipient at the allele level (termed an 8/8 match).<Reference refidx="5"/>  A single antigen/allele mismatch at any of these antigens (7/8 match) lowers the probability of survival between 5% and 10%, with a similar increase in the amount of significant (grades III–IV) acute GVHD.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Of these four antigen pairs, different reports have shown HLA A, C, and DRB1 mismatches to potentially be more highly associated with mortality than the other antigens,<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/> but the differences in outcome are small and inconsistent, making it very difficult to conclude presently that one can pick a more favorable mismatch by choosing one type of antigen mismatch above another.  Many groups are attempting to define specific antigens or pairs of antigens that are associated with either good or poor outcomes. It has been established that a specific HLA C mismatch (HLA-C*03:03/03:04) has outcomes similar to a match; therefore, selection of this mismatch is desirable in an otherwise matched donor/pair combination.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_27">It is well understood that class II antigen DRB1 mismatches increase GVHD and worsen survival.<Reference refidx="6"/> Subsequent data have also shown that multiple mismatches of DQB1, DPB1, and DR3,4,5 lead to worse outcomes in the setting of less than 8/8 matches.<Reference refidx="8"/>  DPB1 mismatches have been extensively studied and classified as permissive or nonpermissive based on T-cell epitope matching.  Patients with 10/10 matches and nonpermissive DPB1 mismatches have more transplant-related mortality, but have survival rates similar to those with DPB1 matches or permissive matches.

The cord blood is processed, cryopreserved, HLA typed, and banked. Unrelated cord blood transplantation has been successful with less-stringent HLA matching requirements compared with standard related or unrelated donors, probably because of limited antigen exposure experienced in utero and different immunological composition.  Cord blood matching has traditionally been performed at an intermediate level for HLA A and B and at an allele level (high resolution) for DRB1.  This means that attempted matching of only six antigens is necessary to choose units for transplantation.  </Para><Para id="_377">Although better outcomes occur when 6/6 or 5/6 HLA matched units are used,<Reference refidx="16"/> successful HCT has occurred even with 4/6 or less matched units in many patients. In a large CIBMTR/Eurocord study, better matching at the allele level using eight antigens (matching for HLA A, B, C, and DRB1) resulted in less transplant-related mortality and improved survival.  Best outcome was noted with 8/8 allele matching versus 4/8 to 7/8 matches, with poor survival in patients with five or more allele mismatches.  Patients receiving 8/8 matched cord blood did not require higher cell doses for better outcomes; however, those with one to three allele mismatches had less transplant-related mortality with total nucleated cell counts  greater than 3 × 10<Superscript>7</Superscript>/kg, and those with four allele mismatches required a total nucleated cell count  greater than 5 × 10<Superscript>7</Superscript>/kg to decrease transplant-related mortality.<Reference refidx="17"/> Many centers will type additional alleles and use the best match possible, but the impact of DQB1, DPB1, and DR3,4,5  mismatches has not been studied in detail.</Para><Para id="_378">As in unrelated PBSC or bone marrow donors, extended HLA testing can support the selection of appropriate cord blood units in HLA-sensitized patients to avoid the potential risk of graft failure.<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/> Evidence also suggests that selecting a mismatched cord blood unit, where the mismatch involves a noninherited maternal antigen, may improve survival.<Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/></Para><Para id="_168">As with unrelated donors, individuals can occasionally have duplicate HLA antigens  (e.g., the HLA A antigen is 01 on both chromosomes).  When this occurs in a donor product and the antigen is matched to one of the recipient antigens, the recipient immune response will see the donor antigens as matched (matched, in the rejection direction), but the donor immune response will see a mismatch in the recipient (mismatch in the GVHD direction).  This variation of partial mismatching has been shown to be important in cord blood transplant outcomes.  Mismatches that are only in the GVHD direction (GVH-O) lead to lower transplant-related mortality and overall mortality than in those with recipient direction only (R-O) mismatches.<Reference refidx="22"/> R-O mismatches have outcomes similar to those caused by  bidirectional mismatches.<Reference refidx="23"/> Although some recommend using unidirectional mismatching as a criteria for cord blood selection, a Eurocord-EBMT analysis disputes the value of this type of mismatching.<Reference refidx="24"/></Para><Para id="_30">Two aspects of umbilical cord blood HCT have made the practice more widely applicable.  First, because a successful procedure can occur with multiple HLA mismatches, more than 95% of patients from a wide variety of ethnicities are able to find at least a 4/6 matched cord blood unit.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="25"/>  Second, as mentioned above, adequate cell dose (minimum 2–3 × 10<Superscript>7</Superscript> total nucleated cells/kg and 1.7 × 10<Superscript>5</Superscript> CD34+ cells/kg) has been shown to be associated with improved survival.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/>  Total nucleated cells are generally used to judge units because techniques to measure CD34-positive doses have not been standardized.  Because even large single umbilical cord blood units are only able to supply these minimum doses to recipients weighing up to 40 kg to 50 kg, early umbilical cord blood HCT focused mainly on smaller children.  Later studies showed that this size barrier could be overcome by using two umbilical cord blood units, as long as each of the units is at least a 4/6 HLA match with the recipient; because two cords provide higher cell doses, umbilical cord blood transplantation is now used widely for larger children and adults.<Reference refidx="28"/>  If a single unit provides an adequate cell dose, there may be disadvantages to adding a second unit.  A large randomized trial demonstrated that in children who had adequately sized single units, the addition of a second unit did not alter relapse, transplant-related mortality, or survival rates, but was associated with worse platelet recovery and higher rates of grades III and IV acute GVHD and extensive chronic GVHD.<Reference refidx="29"/>

This phenomenon came to be termed the GVL or graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effect, and has been shown to be associated with mismatches to both major and minor HLA antigens.  The GVL effect is challenging to use therapeutically because of a strong association between GVL and clinical graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

The most common approach is the use of DLI. This approach relies on the persistence of donor T-cell engraftment after transplant to prevent rejection of donor lymphocytes infused to induce the GVL.  Therapeutic DLI results in potent responses in patients with CML who relapse after transplant (60%–80% enter into long-term remission),<Reference refidx="49"/> but responses in other diseases (AML and ALL) have been less potent, with only 20% to 30% long-term survival.<Reference refidx="50"/> DLI works poorly in patients with acute leukemia who relapse early and who have high levels of active disease.

The killer immunoglobulin-like receptor effect in the allogeneic HCT setting hinges on expression of specific inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors on donor-derived NK cells and either the presence or the absence of their matching HLA class I molecules (killer immunoglobulin-like receptor ligands) on recipient leukemic and normal cells.  Normally, the presence of specific killer immunoglobulin-like receptor ligands interacting with paired inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptor molecules prevents NK cell attack on healthy cells.  In the allogeneic transplant setting, recipient leukemia cells genetically differ from donor NK cells, and they may not have the appropriate inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptor ligand.  Mismatch of ligand and receptor allows NK cell–based killing of recipient leukemia cells to proceed for certain donor-recipient genetic combinations.</Para><Para id="_68">The original observation of decreased relapse with certain killer immunoglobulin-like receptor-ligand combinations was made in the setting of T-cell–depleted haploidentical transplantation and was strongest after HCT for AML.<Reference refidx="55"/><Reference refidx="57"/>  Along with decreasing relapse, these studies have suggested a decrease in GVHD with appropriate killer immunoglobulin-like receptor-ligand combinations.

Because a limited number of centers perform haploidentical HCT and the results of the data in cord blood HCT are preliminary, most transplant programs do not use killer immunoglobulin-like receptor mismatching as part of their strategy for choosing a donor.

Mixed chimerism is associated with more relapse after HCT for malignancies and less GVHD; however, this condition is often advantageous for nonmalignant HCT, where usually only a percentage of normal hematopoiesis is needed to correct the underlying disorder and GVHD is not beneficial.<Reference refidx="85"/>  Finally, serially measured decreasing donor chimerism, especially T-cell–specific chimerism, has been associated with increased risk of rejection.<Reference refidx="86"/></Para><Para id="_80">Because of the implications of persistent recipient chimerism, most transplant programs test for chimerism shortly after engraftment and continue testing regularly until stable full donor hematopoiesis has been achieved.

(Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000700000#_54" url="/types/childhood-cancers/child-hct-hp-pdq">Using donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) or early withdrawal of immune suppression to enhance GVL</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information.) These approaches are frequently used to address this issue, and have been shown in some cases to decrease relapse risk and stop rejection.<Reference refidx="52"/><Reference refidx="87"/>  Timing of tapers of immune suppression and doses and approaches to the administration of DLI to increase or stabilize donor chimerism vary tremendously among transplant regimens and institutions.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="20800103">Barker JN, Byam CE, Kernan NA, et al.: Availability of cord blood extends allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant access to racial and ethnic minorities.

The best tool to assess the impact of pretransplant comorbidities on outcomes after transplant was developed by adapting an existing comorbidity scale, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI).  Investigators at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center systematically defined which of the CCI elements were correlated with transplant-related mortality in adult and pediatric patients.

Antifungal prophylaxis must be tailored to the patient's underlying immune status.  <ScientificName>Pneumocystis</ScientificName> infection can occur in all patients post–bone marrow transplant, and prophylaxis is mandatory.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para><Para id="_400">After HCT, viral infections can be a major source of mortality, especially after T-cell–depleted or cord blood procedures.  Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection has been a major cause of mortality in the past, but effective drugs to treat CMV are available, and preventive strategies, including quantitative PCR monitoring followed by preemptive therapy with ganciclovir, have been developed.  EBV rarely causes lymphoproliferative disease and is generally associated with intensive, multidrug GVHD therapy or T-cell–depleted HCT.  Adenovirus infection is a major issue in T-cell–depleted transplantation, and monitoring by quantitative blood PCR followed by cidofovir therapy has led to a major decrease in morbidity.  Other viruses have been implicated in hemorrhagic cystitis (BK virus), encephalitis and poor count recovery (human herpes virus 6), and other clinical issues. Careful viral monitoring is essential during high-risk allogeneic procedures.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para><Para id="_401">Late bacterial infections can occur in patients who have central lines or patients with significant chronic GVHD. These patients are susceptible to infection with encapsulated organisms, particularly <ScientificName>pneumococcus</ScientificName>. Despite reimmunization, these patients can sometimes develop significant infections, and continued prophylaxis is recommended until a serological response to immunizations has been documented. Occasionally, postallogeneic HCT patients can become functionally asplenic, and antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended.  Patients should remain on infection prophylaxis (e.g., PCP prophylaxis) until immune recovery.  Time to immune recovery varies, but ranges from 3 months to 9 months after autologous HCT and 9 months to 24 months after allogeneic HCT without GVHD.  Patients with active chronic GVHD may have persistent immunosuppression for years.  Many centers monitor T-cell subset recovery post–bone marrow transplant as a guide to infection risk.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para><SummarySection id="_402"><Title>Vaccination after transplantation</Title><Para id="_403">Specific guidelines have been developed by international transplant and infectious disease groups for administration of vaccinations after autologous and allogeneic transplantation (refer to <SummaryRef href="CDR0000700000#_423" url="/types/childhood-cancers/child-hct-hp-pdq">Table 5</SummaryRef>).<Reference refidx="13"/> Autologous transplant recipients should receive immunizations beginning at 6 months after stem cell infusion and should receive live vaccines 24 months after the transplant.  Patients undergoing allogeneic procedures can begin immunizations as soon as 6 months after transplant. However, many groups prefer to wait either until 12 months after the procedure for patients remaining on immune suppression or until patients are off immune suppression.
