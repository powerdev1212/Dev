Its incidence appears to be increasing in some,<Reference refidx="1"/> but not all,<Reference refidx="2"/>  areas of the country.  Overall U.S. incidence rates have likely been increasing for a number of years.<Reference refidx="3"/> At least some of this increase may be attributable to increasing skin cancer awareness and resulting increasing investigation and biopsy of skin lesions.   The total number and incidence rate of NMSCs cannot be estimated precisely because reporting to cancer registries is not required.  However, based on extrapolation of Medicare fee-for-service data to the U.S. population, it has been estimated that the total number of persons treated for NMSCs in 2006 was about 3,500,000.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/>   That number exceeds all other cases of cancer estimated by the American Cancer Society for that year, which totaled about 1.4 million.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_110">Melanoma is a reportable cancer in U.S. cancer registries, so there are more reliable estimates of incidence than is the case with NMSCs.

suggests that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the sensitivity of an
individual’s skin to UV radiation are risk factors for skin cancer, though
the type of exposure (high-intensity and short-duration vs. chronic exposure) and the pattern
of exposure (continuous vs. intermittent) may differ among the  three main skin cancer types.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> In addition, the immune system may play a role in pathogenesis of skin cancer.

comes from observational and analytic epidemiologic studies.  Such studies have consistently shown that
increased cumulative sun exposure is a risk factor for NMSC.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/>  Individuals whose skin tans poorly or burns easily after sun

adolescence may be particularly important.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_174"><Title>Interventions With Inadequate Evidence as to Whether They Reduce Risk of  Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer </Title><SummarySection id="_175"><Title>Sunscreen use and UV radiation avoidance</Title><Para id="_116">It is not known whether interventions designed to reduce exposure to UV radiation through the use of sunscreens and protective clothing or through limitation of exposure time  reduce the incidence of NMSC in humans.  Some studies have used solar keratoses rather than invasive skin cancer as the study endpoint.  It is generally felt that half or more of SCCs  arise from solar keratoses.  However, nearly half of SCCs occur in clinically normal skin.<Reference refidx="12"/>   A longitudinal study has shown that the progression rate from solar keratoses to SCC is about 0.075% to 0.096% per year, or less than 1 in 1,000 per year.<Reference refidx="12"/>   Moreover, in a population-based longitudinal study, there was an approximately 26% spontaneous regression rate of solar keratoses within 1 year of a screening examination.<Reference refidx="13"/> Therefore, it is likely that solar keratosis is a poor surrogate endpoint in SCC prevention trials.</Para><Para id="_117">One very small randomized placebo-controlled study of a sunscreen (sun protection factor [SPF] 29) was conducted in 53 volunteers who had either clinical evidence of solar keratoses or NMSC.<Reference refidx="14"/>   Only 37 of the participants returned for the planned 2-year follow-up (attrition rate of 30%).  The rate of new solar keratoses was lower after 2 years in the  sunscreen group than in the placebo (base-cream) group  (estimated 36% reduction in annual rate, <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .001). Another study showed that regular sunscreen use helps reduce the incidence of solar keratoses
 and increase remission of existing
lesions.<Reference refidx="15"/>  In Australia, 588 persons aged 40 years and older who attended a free
skin-cancer screening clinic and had 1 to 30 solar keratoses were enrolled in a
randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing the effect of regular sunscreen (SPF 17) use  on solar keratoses; 431 persons
completed the study.  Individuals in the sunscreen group developed 
fewer new lesions and had  more remissions of existing lesions
than those in the base-cream placebo group. There was an increase of 1.0 in the mean number of solar keratoses in the base-cream group versus a decrease of 0.6 in the sunscreen group (difference = 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81–2.25).  The rate ratio of new lesions was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.54–0.71).  Furthermore, in the sunscreen group,  the 
development of new lesions and the remission of existing lesions were related to the amount of sunscreen used. Such a relationship was not observed in the base-cream group.</Para><Para id="_132">However, a different Australian randomized study (the Nambour Skin Cancer Prevention Trial) showed that, after 4.5 years of follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of BCCs or SCCs with regular  SPF 16 sunscreen use. This study did not include a sunscreen placebo. Although a secondary subset analysis of the overall number of tumors showed a reduction in the frequency of SCCs  on the sites of daily sunscreen application, the validity of the finding is questionable because of the possible effects of extensive multiple statistical testing.<Reference refidx="16"/> An 8-year post-trial observational follow-up demonstrated statistically significant reductions in both the frequency and the overall incidence of SCCs in the regular sunscreen-use arm, but the reliability of these findings is uncertain given their occurrence outside of the controlled-trial environment.<Reference refidx="17"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_122"><Title>Chemopreventive agents</Title><SummarySection id="_137"><Title>Beta carotene</Title><Para id="_123">In the Physicians’ Health Study, 21,884 male physicians with no reported history of BCC or SCC were randomly assigned to take 50 mg doses of daily oral beta carotene versus placebo in a 2 × 2 factorial trial of beta carotene and aspirin.<Reference refidx="18"/>   Incidence of NMSCs was a secondary endpoint in the trial.  After 12 years of beta carotene or placebo administration, there was no difference in incidence of either BCC or SCC.    RCTs
of long-term treatment with beta carotene in individuals previously treated for
NMSC also showed no benefit in preventing the occurrence of new NMSCs.<Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="19"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_138"><Title>Isotretinoin</Title><Para id="_124">High-dose isotretinoin was found to prevent new skin cancers in
individuals with xeroderma pigmentosum.<Reference refidx="20"/>  However, a RCT of
long-term treatment with isotretinoin in individuals previously treated for
BCC  showed that this agent did not prevent the
occurrence of new BCCs but did produce side effects
characteristic of isotretinoin treatment.<Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_139"><Title>Selenium</Title><Para id="_126">A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 1,312
patients with a history of BCC or SCC and a mean
follow-up of 6.4 years showed that 200 µg of selenium (in brewer’s yeast tablets)
did not have a statistically significant effect on the primary endpoint of
BCC development  and may increase the risk of SCC and total NMSC.<Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/> The cumulative incidence of  NMSC was 0.20 versus 0.16 per person year of follow-up in the selenium and placebo groups, respectively (unadjusted relative risk = 1.27; 95% CI, 1.11–1.45).</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_140"><Title>Celecoxib</Title><Para id="_127">The use of celecoxib as a chemopreventive agent for actinic keratosis was assessed in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.  Two hundred forty high-risk men and women (each with 10–40 actinic keratoses and a history of previous skin cancer) received 200 mg doses of celecoxib twice daily or a placebo for 9 months with an additional 2-month follow-up.  No difference was found in the incidence of actinic keratosis, but a post hoc analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in the mean number of NMSCs per patient (rate ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.24–0.75; absolute difference, 0.2 lesions per patient).  The ultimate utility of celecoxib in preventing NMSCs remains unclear, given the exploratory nature of the analysis, the challenge of interpreting benefits in fractions of lesions, and the potential for serious adverse cardiovascular effects associated with long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, the unexpected finding of the lack of effect of celecoxib on actinic keratosis but apparent effect on SCC and BCC incidence raises questions about the use of actinic keratosis as an intermediate endpoint for SCC and BCC and the current understanding of the natural history of NMSCs.<Reference refidx="25"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_141"><Title>Alpha-difluoromethylornithine</Title><Para id="_128">Alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor used in intravenous form to treat African trypanosomiasis and in topical form to treat female hirsutism, was investigated as a chemopreventive agent in patients with prior NMSCs.<Reference refidx="26"/>  After a 4-week placebo run-in period, 291 volunteers who took at least 80% of their placebos were randomly assigned to oral DFMO (500 mg/m<Superscript>2</Superscript>/day) versus placebo for up to 5 years (average 4 years).  At baseline, the placebo group had a higher mean number of prior NMSCs than the DFMO group (4.9 vs. 4.2; <Emphasis> P</Emphasis> = .1), and a longer history of NMSC (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .002), possibly favoring the DFMO group. The primary endpoint of the study was the number of new NMSC events, and the rate was 0.44 new cancers per year in the DFMO group versus 0.61 in the placebo group (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .07).  In a subset analysis, there was a statistically significant difference in BCC events favoring the DFMO group (0.28 vs. 0.40 per year; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .03) and no difference in SCC rates.  DFMO is known to have ototoxicity, and the average hearing loss of audiograms was greater in the DFMO group, which was about 4 dB versus 2 dB (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .003).  In the DFMO  group,10.8%   discontinued the study drug because of a greater than 15 dB hearing loss, compared with a 4.5% discontinuation in the placebo group (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .06).  DFMO hearing loss is usually reversible.  In summary, the efficacy of DFMO for skin cancer prevention is unclear, and it remains investigational for this indication.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_177"><Title>Interventions With Inadequate Evidence as to Whether They Reduce Risk of Melanoma</Title><SummarySection id="_178"><Title>Sunscreens</Title><Para id="_179">  Results from a collaborative
European case-control study and one animal study suggest that
sunscreens that protect against sunburn may not protect against UV
radiation–associated cutaneous melanoma.<Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/>  Nonmodifiable host factors,
such as propensity to burn, a large number of benign melanocytic nevi, and
atypical nevi may also increase the risk of developing cutaneous melanoma.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_133">A post hoc analysis of the Nambour Skin Cancer Prevention Trial (discussed above) examined the incidence of melanoma at a median of 14.2 person-years  of follow-up.  In the trial, participants were randomly assigned to daily or discretionary sunscreen use from 1992 to 1996.  Follow-up continued until 2006 via either active participation, in which subjects completed periodic questionnaires about new skin cancers and relevant sun behaviors, or passive participation, in which subjects' medical records were reviewed for skin cancer diagnoses; 52% of the trial participants were actively participating as of 2006.  Eleven melanomas were diagnosed in the daily sunscreen arm versus 22 in the discretionary-use arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.5; 95% CI, 0.24–1.02), of which 3 versus 11 were invasive, respectively (HR =  0.27; 95% CI, 0.08–0.97).  There was no difference in the rates of melanoma on prescribed sunscreen application sites between the two groups.  This study has several important limitations: melanoma was not a planned outcome of the original trial; the CIs of the outcome estimates are very wide, indicating substantial uncertainty of the magnitude of the effect; and there is potential for the introduction of confounding with the widespread use of the passive participant option during the follow-up phase of the study.<Reference refidx="29"/></Para><Para id="_134">A meta-analysis of 18 studies that explored the association between melanoma risk and previous sunscreen use illustrates widely differing study qualities and suggests little or no association.<Reference refidx="30"/> A systematic review of the association between sunscreen use and the development of melanocytic nevi in children reported similar issues with study quality and heterogeneity, hindering conclusive assessments; however, of 15 studies meeting inclusion criteria, 12 found either an increased incidence or no association.<Reference refidx="31"/> Thus, the current evidence indicates that sunscreen application as practiced   in the general population shows no clear  association with reduced risk of melanocytic nevi or melanoma.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_129"><Title>Behavioral Interventions to Change Sun-Protective Practices</Title><Para id="_130">As noted previously, direct evidence that interventions, such as sunscreen or protection from UV light exposure, decrease the risk of skin cancer is sparse.  However, given the association between UV light exposure and subsequent risk of skin cancer, counseling interventions aimed at increasing sun-protective behaviors have been examined.  The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review of this evidence.  Although the USPSTF review found no randomized trials directly linking counseling strategies to skin cancer reduction, it found 11 trials, rated as fair in quality, that tested the effect of interventions on sun-protective behaviors.<Reference refidx="32"/>  Several trials of behavioral interventions in adults, sometimes as part of an intervention addressing multiple health-related behaviors, such as smoking and nutrition, showed a short-term increase in self-reported sun-protective behaviors.  However, the effect sizes were small to modest, without clear evidence that the differences were clinically meaningful.<Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/><Reference refidx="35"/><Reference refidx="36"/><Reference refidx="37"/> Likewise, appearance-based behavioral interventions in young women have had a favorable impact on self-reported indoor tanning behavior, but no long-term follow-up or health outcomes were reported.<Reference refidx="38"/><Reference refidx="39"/><Reference refidx="40"/>   A randomized, primary care office–based counseling intervention in adolescents showed an increase in self-reported midday sun avoidance and sunscreen use in the intervention group for up to 24 months.<Reference refidx="41"/>   A randomized trial of a provider-based sun protection promotion counseling program for parents for their infant children showed a small increase in sun-protective actions, of questionable clinical importance according to the researchers.<Reference refidx="42"/></Para><Para id="_135">Nevertheless, studies of intervention strategies for reducing UV radiation exposure suggest that the best approach is education about the risks associated with sun exposure and sunburn and education about sun-protection strategies.<Reference refidx="43"/><Reference refidx="44"/>  In one study, an educational intervention at the time of treatment for skin cancer—a time when an individual may have heightened awareness of his or her susceptibility to skin cancer—seemed to have the greatest effect.<Reference refidx="43"/> However, even in such a high-risk group, it was difficult for many individuals to maintain sun-protective behaviors.  In a community skin cancer screening study, researchers found that, although regular use of sunscreens was not related to personal or family history of skin cancer, it was more common among persons who perceived themselves to be at moderate or high risk of developing melanoma.<Reference refidx="44"/></Para><Para id="_136">Sun-protective strategies may include avoiding sun exposure at times of the day when the exposure is more intense and wearing clothing that protects skin from sun exposure. Self-examination for skin-pigmentary characteristics associated with melanoma (e.g., freckling status) may be a useful way to identify individuals at an increased risk of developing melanoma.<Reference refidx="45"/>  Skin type (propensity to burn after sun exposure and tanning ability), alone or with other physical characteristics, such as hair color, has been used as a measure of sun sensitivity in epidemiologic studies.<Reference refidx="46"/></Para><Para id="_131">In summary, a number of randomized trials and other studies have suggested that counseling or health information may have an effect on sun- or UV-protective behaviors.  However, in addition to lack of information on health outcomes and relatively short follow-up times, most of the studies suffer from important methodologic problems, including the possibility of self-reporting inaccuracy, high study attrition rates, and lack of information about sustainability of the interventions.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="14578151">Athas WF, Hunt WC, Key CR: Changes in nonmelanoma skin cancer incidence between 1977-1978 and 1998-1999 in Northcentral New Mexico.
