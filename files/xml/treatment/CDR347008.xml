Gaertn. Milk thistle is also referred to as holy thistle, Marian thistle, Mary thistle, Our Lady’s thistle, St. Mary thistle, wild artichoke, Mariendistel (German), and Chardon-Marie (French). The plant is indigenous to Europe but can also be found in the United States and South America. Traditionally, the leaves have been used in salads, and the fruit of the flower has been roasted as a coffee substitute. The seeds of milk thistle are the medicinal parts of the plant.<Reference refidx="1"/> The primary active constituent of milk thistle is <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000340936">silymarin</GlossaryTermRef>, which is composed of  the following <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000373084">isomers</GlossaryTermRef>: silybin (consisting of silybins A and B), isosilybin (consisting of isosilybins A and B), silychristin, and silydianin.    Most supplements are standardized according to their  silybin content.   Silybin and isosilybin are both mixtures of two diastereomers, silybins A and B and isosilybins A and B, respectively.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/> Special formulations of  silybin have been developed to enhance the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044225">bioavailability</GlossaryTermRef> of the herbal product; these forms are sold under the names Legalon, silipide, and Siliphos. Because of milk thistle’s <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000373086">lipophilic</GlossaryTermRef> nature, it is usually administered in capsule or tablet form rather than as an herbal tea. In Europe, silybin is administered <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046682">intravenously</GlossaryTermRef> as the only effective antidote for <ScientificName><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000367455">Amanita phalloides</GlossaryTermRef></ScientificName> (Fr.).<Reference refidx="4"/> Humans exposed to this mushroom toxin develop serious liver failure that ultimately progresses to death.</Para><Para id="_11">Several companies distribute milk thistle as a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000373932">dietary supplement</GlossaryTermRef>. In the United States, dietary supplements are regulated as foods, not drugs. Therefore, premarket evaluation and approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are not required unless specific disease prevention or treatment claims are made. Because dietary supplements are not formally reviewed for manufacturing consistency, ingredients may vary considerably from lot to lot; in addition, there is no guarantee that ingredients identified on product labels are present at all or are present in the specified amounts. It is important to note that the FDA has not approved the use of milk thistle as a treatment for cancer patients or patients with any other medical condition.</Para><Para id="_12">To conduct <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044168">clinical</GlossaryTermRef> drug research in the United States, researchers must file an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044763">Investigational</GlossaryTermRef> New Drug (IND) application with the FDA. The IND application process is confidential, and IND information can be disclosed only by the applicants. To date, only one investigator has announced holding an IND to study milk thistle as an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000367454">adjunct</GlossaryTermRef> cancer treatment.</Para><Para id="_13">Despite milk thistle’s long history of being used to treat <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046312">liver</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044970">biliary</GlossaryTermRef> complaints, it was not until 1968 that silymarin was isolated from the seeds of the plant, and it was proposed that silymarin might be the active ingredient.<Reference refidx="5"/> Silymarin was later determined to be a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000330168"/>flavonolignan that is composed of four structurally similar compounds: silybin, isosilybin, silydianin, and silychristin.<Reference refidx="2"/> Researchers have investigated the role that silibinin may play in the treatment of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046371">hepatitis</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045478">cirrhosis</GlossaryTermRef>. Most studies have investigated the isolated compound silymarin or its most active isomer silybin, rather than the herbal plant in its whole form.</Para><Para id="_14">Silymarin is most well known for its purported effects on the liver.
