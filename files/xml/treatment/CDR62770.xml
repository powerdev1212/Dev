The average patient is between 32
to 38 years of age and because many women choose to delay childbearing, it is
likely that the incidence of breast cancer during pregnancy will increase.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_102"><Title>Pathology</Title><Para id="_43">Breast cancer pathology is similar in age-matched pregnant and nonpregnant
women.  Hormone receptor assays are usually negative in pregnant breast cancer
patients, but this may be the result of receptor binding by high serum estrogen
levels associated with the pregnancy.  Enzyme immunocytochemical
receptor assays, however,  are more sensitive than competitive binding assays.  A study
that used binding methods indicated similar receptor positivity between pregnant
and nonpregnant women with breast cancer.<Reference refidx="1"/>  The study concluded that
increased estrogen levels during pregnancy could result in a higher incidence
of receptor positivity detected with immunohistochemistry than is detected by
radiolabeled ligand binding, which is because of competitive inhibition by high levels of
endogenous estrogen.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_103"><Title>Diagnosis</Title><Para id="_56">The natural tenderness and engorgement of the breasts of pregnant and lactating
women may hinder detection of discrete masses and early diagnoses
of breast cancer.  Delays in diagnoses are common, with an average reported
delay of 5 to 15 months from the onset of symptoms.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>  Because of this
delay, cancers are typically detected at a later stage than in a nonpregnant,
age-matched population.<Reference refidx="6"/>  To detect breast cancer, pregnant and lactating
women should practice self-examination and undergo a breast examination as part
of the routine prenatal examination by a doctor.  If an abnormality is found,
diagnostic approaches such as ultrasound and mammography may be used.  With
proper shielding, mammography poses little risk of radiation exposure to the
fetus.<Reference refidx="7"/>  Mammograms should only be used, however,  to evaluate dominant masses
and to locate occult carcinomas in the presence of other suspicious physical
findings.<Reference refidx="7"/>   Since at least 25% of mammograms in pregnancy may be negative in
the presence of cancer, a biopsy is essential for the diagnosis of any palpable
mass.  Diagnosis may be safely accomplished with a fine-needle aspiration, core biopsy, or
excisional biopsy under local anesthesia.  To avoid a false-positive diagnosis
as a result of misinterpretation of pregnancy-related changes, the pathologist
should be advised that the patient is pregnant.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_104"><Title>Survival</Title><Para id="_105">Overall survival of pregnant women with breast cancer may be worse than in
nonpregnant women at all stages;<Reference refidx="7"/>  however, this may be primarily the result of  delayed diagnoses.<Reference refidx="9"/>
Termination of pregnancy has not been shown to have any beneficial effect on
breast cancer outcome and is not usually considered as a therapeutic
option.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/>  </Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="8095853" MedlineID="93201474">Elledge RM, Ciocca DR, Langone G, et al.: Estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER-2/neu protein in breast cancers from pregnant patients.

radiation exposure to the fetus.  Nuclear scans cause fetal
radiation exposure.<Reference refidx="1"/>  If such scans are essential for evaluation, hydration and

radioactivity.  Timing of the exposure to radiation relative to the gestational
age of the fetus may be more critical than the actual dose of radiation

congenital malformations, mental retardation, and increased relative risk of carcinogenesis.  Doses greater than 1 Gy

If surgery  is
planned, however, lactation should be suppressed to decrease the size and vascularity of
the breasts.  If chemotherapy is to be given, lactation should also be suppressed because many antineoplastics (i.e., cyclophosphamide and methotrexate), when 
given systemically,  may occur in high levels in breast milk and would
affect the nursing baby.  In general, women receiving chemotherapy should not
breastfeed.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_60"><Title>Fetal Consequences of Maternal Breast Cancer</Title><Para id="_61">No damaging effects on the fetus from maternal breast cancer have been

transplantation for hematologic disorders, a 25% incidence of preterm labor and low
