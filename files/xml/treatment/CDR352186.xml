In fact, patients older than 65 years bear a disproportionate burden of cancer as well as increased prevalence of medical problems such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension.<Reference refidx="1"/>    Whether patients are seen in primary care  or cancer care settings, unexplained symptoms often frustrate physicians and patients.<Reference refidx="2"/> Because many advanced cancers spread to the thorax, symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, chest pain, or palpitations often present a challenge in sorting out the likely cause of the problem and developing appropriate interventions. Evidence-based recommendations have been published describing various approaches to the problems of cancer-related fatigue, anorexia, depression, and dyspnea.<Reference refidx="3"/> Cancer patients are often also at higher risk for pulmonary infections.</Para><Para id="_7">Clinicians caring for cancer patients should be familiar with the assessment and treatment of common conditions that manifest as chest symptoms.  In addition, these clinicians need to be familiar with some cancer-specific aspects of chest symptoms and syndromes.  Dyspnea is a common symptom of certain cancers such as lung cancer and is also common in patients with numerous advanced cancers.  It is often multifactorial.  Optimal treatment requires an understanding of contributing etiologies and pathophysiologies to direct therapeutic interventions as clinically appropriate.  Important cardiopulmonary syndromes include malignant pleural effusion, malignant pericardial effusion, superior vena cava syndrome, and lymphangitic carcinomatosis.</Para><Para id="_1_4">In this summary, unless otherwise stated, evidence and practice issues as they relate to adults are discussed.

It is a subjective experience involving many factors that modulate the quality and intensity of its perception. Patients with comparable degrees of functional lung impairment and disease burden may describe varying intensities of dyspnea.  Patients use a host of different words and phrases to describe the sensation of breathlessness. Terms such as tightness and suffocating are sometimes used.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_11">Reports on the frequency of dyspnea also vary, depending on the setting and the extent of disease.<Reference refidx="2"/>     In one study, 49% of a general cancer population reported breathlessness, and 20% rated their breathlessness as moderate to severe.<Reference refidx="3"/> Patients with advanced cancer experience this symptom more frequently and more intensely than do patients with limited disease.  One study found that 75  of 135 patients with advanced cancer reporting to an outpatient palliative care clinic were experiencing moderate-to-severe dyspnea.<Reference refidx="4"/>   Breathlessness was a complaint at presentation in 60% of 289 patients with lung cancer.<Reference refidx="5"/> Results of a large study showed that 70% of patients suffered from dyspnea in the last 6 weeks of life.<Reference refidx="6"/>       About one-third of  patients who could report the intensity of their dyspnea rated it as moderate to severe. Another study revealed that half of patients with advanced cancer scored their dyspnea as moderate to severe.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_12"><Title>Pathophysiology and Etiology</Title><Para id="_13">The pathophysiological mechanisms of breathlessness are numerous and complex.<Reference refidx="8"/>   Peripheral and central mechanisms as well as mechanical and chemical pathways are involved with a variety of sensory afferent sources.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_188">The qualities of dyspnea can be appreciated as work/effort, tightness, and air hunger.  The experience of excess work and effort  is caused by sensory-perceptual mechanisms similar to those involved in muscles exercising.  Tightness is caused by stimulation of airway receptors with bronchoconstriction. Intensity of air hunger and unsatisfied inspiration is caused by imbalances of respiratory drive, outgoing signals from the brain, and feedback from afferents in the respiratory system.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_14">The direct causes of dyspnea in patients with advanced cancer are numerous; categorizing them can assist in the etiologic work-up. One approach is to divide direct causes into the following four groups:</Para><OrderedList id="_15" Style="Arabic" Compact="No"><ListItem>Direct tumor effects such as intrinsic or extrinsic airway obstruction, pleural involvement, parenchymal involvement either by primary or metastatic disease,  superior vena cava syndrome, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, and pericardial effusion.</ListItem><ListItem>Indirect tumor effects such as pneumonia, a pulmonary embolus, paralysis of a hemidiaphragm, or weakening of the respiratory muscles from sarcopenia.</ListItem><ListItem>Treatment-related causes such as pulmonary fibrosis secondary to radiation therapy or chemotherapy or chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy.</ListItem><ListItem>Causes unrelated to the cancer. These include chronic obstructive airway disease, congestive heart failure, anemia, certain acidotic states, and bronchospasm.</ListItem><ListItem>Functional causes (e.g., anxiety).</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_16">One study found that in patients experiencing dyspnea from advanced cancer, a median of five different abnormalities could have contributed to their shortness of breath.<Reference refidx="7"/>   Spirometry was abnormal in 93% of  100 patients examined, with 5% having obstructive patterns, 41% restrictive patterns, and 47% mixed patterns; 49% of patients had lung cancer, 91% had abnormal chest radiographs, and 65% had parenchymal or pleural involvement. These results indicate that a subset of patients will experience shortness of breath without any apparent lung involvement. The potentially correctable causes of dyspnea included hypoxia (40%), anemia (20%), and bronchospasm (52%). No significant association between the type of respiratory impairment and the degree of dyspnea was found. Most of these patients were current or former smokers. Most patients also had a significant lowering of their maximum inspiratory pressures, suggesting severe respiratory muscle dysfunction. This finding was duplicated in another study.<Reference refidx="4"/>   Of patients admitted to hospice care, 34% had histories of cardiac disease and 24% had histories of respiratory disease.<Reference refidx="6"/>   Only 39% of  terminally ill patients who reported dyspnea had lung or pleural involvement. The etiology of dyspnea could not be clearly identified in approximately one-quarter of  patients. Another study found that 49% of lung cancer patients presented with airflow obstruction.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="13"/></Para><Para id="_17">Respiratory muscle dysfunction is  an underrecognized factor contributing to dyspnea. Causes of respiratory muscle dysfunction include neuromuscular disease, malnutrition, and deficiencies of potassium, magnesium, and inorganic phosphate.<Reference refidx="14"/>       Poor oxygenation, muscle fatigue, abnormal cortisol and catecholamine levels, and circulating cytokines are also implicated.</Para><Para id="_18">Although it is commonly believed that anxiety is associated with breathlessness, researchers found that anxiety and shortness of breath do not invariably go together.<Reference refidx="7"/>  One study demonstrated that the involvement of the lungs by cancer, anxiety, and poor maximal inspiratory pressures were correlates of the intensity of dyspnea in patients with advanced cancer. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_19"><Title>Assessment</Title><Para id="_20">The multidimensional nature of dyspnea must be noted in the complicated assessment of this symptom. Patient-reported outcome is the gold standard for assessment of dyspnea. There is no consensus on what constitutes the best instrument for assessing dyspnea. Visual analog and numerical rating scales appear to be useful and are commonly utilized.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/> The Borg Scale is occasionally utilized.<Reference refidx="15"/> The Cancer Dyspnea Scale is a multidimensional instrument, initially developed in Japan for patients with lung cancer and later translated into Swedish. This scale has been shown to be valid and reliable in patients with advanced lung cancer.   The subscales measure sense of effort (physical dimension), sense of anxiety (psychological dimension), and sense of discomfort.<Reference refidx="18"/>      These tools are limited, however, because they are unidimensional and do not account for the relative contribution of different factors to a patient’s perception of breathlessness. Assessment should include the impact of dyspnea on the patient’s functional status and appreciation of  the dynamic component of dyspnea—namely, exertional dyspnea.</Para><Para id="_202">Objective signs such as tachypnea or the use of accessory breathing muscles frequently do not match a patient’s perception of dyspnea and the degree of functional impairment it causes. Numerous factors, including psychosocial issues, may affect a patient’s experience of dyspnea.  Pulmonary function tests, with few exceptions, play a limited role in the assessment of this syndrome.  Lack of a clear understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying dyspnea hampers the clinician’s overall ability to effectively manage it.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Para id="_22">A comprehensive history and examination are essential to an accurate assessment of dyspnea.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="15"/>      The temporal onset, qualities of the symptom, associated symptoms, precipitating and relieving events or activities, and responses to medications should be reviewed. Sudden onset may herald a pulmonary embolism or infection, whereas gradual onset may suggest the development of a pleural effusion. A history of obstructive airways or cardiac disease can shed some light on possible underlying causes. Investigations such as measuring oxygen saturation can be useful in determining whether a patient is hypoxic. In the setting of advanced, incurable cancer, arterial blood gasses play a limited role.</Para><Para id="_23">Diagnostic tests that may help to determine the etiology of dyspnea include chest imaging by radiography, computer-assisted tomography, complete blood counts, oxygen saturation at rest and with exercise and, to a much lesser extent, pulmonary function tests. Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) measurements may be helpful, particularly if no apparent cause can be found.<Reference refidx="7"/>   MIP is a reliable functional test of the strength of the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles. Functional assessments such as the 6-minute walk test and exercise ergometry may also provide valuable information about the severity and impact of dyspnea.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_24"><Title>Management of Dyspnea</Title><SummarySection id="_26"><Title>Management of underlying causes</Title><Para id="_27">As with all symptoms, it is essential to identify and treat the underlying cause(s) of dyspnea if possible and when appropriate. Examples of specific underlying causes (some of them potentially reversible) and their treatments include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_28" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem> Tumor obstruction (upper airways, bronchus, or superior vena cava): Radiation therapy, hormone therapy, or chemotherapy for sensitive tumors. Bronchoscope-guided cauterization or laser ablation of intraluminal masses in large airways can be considered when such technology and expertise is available.<Reference refidx="21"/>    Stenting of large airways with expandable stents when the obstruction is extraluminal has been described. </ListItem><ListItem>Carcinomatous lymphangitis: A trial of corticosteroids, e.g., dexamethasone. The optimal dose is not clear. Chemotherapy should be considered in sensitive cancers.</ListItem><ListItem>Superior vena cava obstruction:  Chemotherapy for sensitive tumors, radiation therapy, stenting, opioids for dyspnea, and/or steroids as appropriate for the clinical context.</ListItem><ListItem>Bronchospasms: Bronchodilators. The indiscriminate use of bronchodilators, particularly in the absence of bronchospasm, is discouraged.  The treatment of underlying chronic obstructive disease should be optimized with bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids as appropriate, particularly because many patients may be current or former smokers.</ListItem><ListItem>Pleural effusions: Pleural aspiration by thoracentesis or chest drain. Pleurodesis in selected patients with recurrent effusions should be considered. Indwelling catheters are now available for patients with recurrent effusions who are not suitable for pleurodesing.</ListItem><ListItem>Pericardial effusions: Drainage for immediate relief and possibly intrapericardial chemotherapy or definitive surgery, depending on the clinical context and goals of care.</ListItem><ListItem>Gross ascites: Abdominal paracentesis to relieve the diaphragmatic splinting.</ListItem><ListItem>Cardiac failure: Diuretics and other drugs as appropriate.</ListItem><ListItem>Chest infections: Antibiotics and chest physiotherapy when appropriate.</ListItem><ListItem>Anemia: Blood transfusions in select patients.</ListItem><ListItem>Pulmonary embolism:  Anticoagulate when appropriate.</ListItem><ListItem>Anxiety: Psychotropic medications and psychotherapy.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_29"><Title>Symptomatic management</Title><Para id="_30">Symptomatic management of dyspnea is based primarily on oxygen therapy, opioids for palliation of dyspnea, and treatment of underlying causes (e.g., superimposed infection) when appropriate.</Para><Para id="_32">Opioids represent an extremely effective treatment for dyspnea in cancer patients. Fear of side effects should not prevent the appropriate use of opioids in this setting. Most authorities believe that, if used appropriately, opioids do not hasten death in dyspneic cancer patients; rather, they reduce physical and psychological distress and exhaustion, and early use improves quality of life.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="22"/>     Clinically significant hypoventilation following opioid therapy depends largely on the history of previous exposure to opioids and the rate of increase of the opioid dose.  As with opioid use in pain management, the principles of starting at a regular low dose in opioid-naïve patients followed by appropriate dose titration applies. Opioid therapy for dyspnea is administered similarly to, and often concurrent with, opioid therapy for pain control.  Most of the available evidence supports the role of opioids in relieving dyspnea in malignant and nonmalignant conditions.<Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>];<Reference refidx="25"/><Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_33">Anecdotal and experimental evidence suggest a role for nebulized opioid administration in the treatment of dyspnea.<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="30"/> Opioid receptors are present on sensory nerve endings in the airways; however, nebulization is an inefficient way of administering drugs.<Reference refidx="28"/>      Pharmacokinetic studies suggest that the systemic bioavailability of nebulized morphine is extremely poor and erratic, varying from 4% to 8%.<Reference refidx="31"/>   Some patients may experience claustrophobia. Available evidence does not support the clinical use of nebulized opioids. More clinical trials are needed to better determine the role of this mode of treatment.</Para><Para id="_203">Patients who are hypoxic on room air are likely to benefit from oxygen therapy, probably through a decrease in the chemoreceptor input to the respiratory center and the brain cortex.  In two controlled trials, cancer patients with dyspnea who were randomly assigned in a crossover design showed significant improvement in their dyspnea.<Reference refidx="32"/><Reference refidx="33"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] The role of supplemental oxygen has also been examined in patients without hypoxemia in a large randomized controlled trial.  Supplemental oxygen given at 2 L/min did not significantly improve dyspnea, compared with supplemental air.<Reference refidx="34"/> Therefore, supplemental oxygen is recommended for cancer patients with hypoxemia but not for those who are nonhypoxemic.</Para><Para id="_204">Other investigators have examined the effect of other oxygen delivery modalities on dyspnea in cancer patients, such as high-flow oxygen and noninvasive ventilation with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP).  High-flow oxygen devices deliver up to 40 L of humidified and heated oxygen per minute, and may reduce the intensity of dyspnea in patients who do not respond to low-flow oxygen.<Reference refidx="35"/>  BiPAP has also been shown in several randomized controlled trials to alleviate dyspnea among hospitalized cancer patients,<Reference refidx="35"/><Reference refidx="36"/> particularly in patients with hypoventilation.   These interventions may be reasonable options for patients with hypoxemia and refractory dyspnea despite the use of low-flow supplemental oxygen.</Para><Para id="_34">Other options suggested for symptomatic treatment include methylxanthines, sedatives, tranquilizers, nebulized local anesthetics, and antiprostaglandins. The role of methylxanthines in cancer-related dyspnea has not been clarified. Chlorpromazine and promethazine have been shown to decrease dyspnea without affecting ventilation in noncancer patients, but their role in cancer-related dyspnea is unclear. Four out of five randomized controlled trials failed to demonstrate any benefit for using benzodiazepines in cancer patients.<Reference refidx="15"/>;<Reference refidx="37"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] One randomized single-blind study suggests that the combination of two scheduled medications (subcutaneous morphine and subcutaneous midazolam) and one as needed (subcutaneous morphine)  for episodes of breakthrough dyspnea is more effective than the other evaluated combinations for controlling breakthrough dyspnea and requires further study.<Reference refidx="38"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]    The role of benzodiazepines appears to be limited to treatment of dyspnea that is considered a somatic manifestation of a panic disorder or use when a patient has concurrent severe anxiety. 

No evidence supports the use of nebulized local anesthetics for the treatment of breathlessness.

is a common cause of pleural effusions in general.  Malignancy accounts for
roughly 40% of symptomatic pleural effusions, with congestive heart failure and
infection being the other leading causes.<Reference refidx="1"/>
Lung cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma, and leukemia account for approximately 75% of
all malignancy-associated effusions.  Significant use of health care resources is
attributable to malignant effusions, with approximately 100,000 cases per year
being diagnosed in the United States and 43 cases being detected per 100,000
hospital admissions.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_43"><Title>Pathogenesis</Title><Para id="_44">The normal pleural fluid space is occupied with approximately 10 cc of fluid with 2 g/dL
protein. A pleural effusion is an accumulation of an abnormal amount of fluid between
the visceral and parietal pleura of the chest.  Normally, pleural fluid is absorbed by
pulmonary venous capillaries (80%–90%), with some of it also absorbed by pleural
lymphatics.  Malignant effusions are usually exudative rather than transudative.
Exudative effusions exhibit any one of the following characteristics:<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_45" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Pleural fluid to serum protein ratio greater than 0.5.</ListItem><ListItem>Pleural fluid to serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) ratio greater than  0.6.</ListItem><ListItem>Pleural fluid LDH greater than two-thirds of the upper limit of serum LDH.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_46">These exudative malignant effusions are generally caused by pleural metastases, disruption of pulmonary capillary endothelium, or malignant obstruction of pleural lymphatics.  Paramalignant effusions may result from chemotherapy, radiation therapy, atelectasis, or lymph node involvement.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_47"><Title>Assessment</Title><Para id="_48">Common symptoms associated with malignant pleural effusions include dyspnea, cough, and chest discomfort.  About 20% of patients may experience weight loss and malaise.
A chest x-ray is most commonly used for radiographic assessment.  About 175 cc of
pleural fluid will cause a blunted costophrenic angle discernible on chest radiography.  A
chest computerized tomography scan is more sensitive than a simple chest x-ray and is
often used for assessment of loculated effusions because, in some instances, up to 500 cc
of loculated fluid can be obscured behind the dome of the diaphragm.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_49">Not all pleural effusions detected in cancer patients will
turn out to be malignant effusions.  Cancer patients are prone to developing conditions
such as congestive heart failure, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, malnutrition, and associated low serum albumin, each
of which may cause a symptomatic effusion for which the clinical management would  
substantially differ from the management of a malignant effusion.  For this reason, 
cytologic assessment is important.  Pleural fluid cytology requires a minimum sample of
250 cc.  The morphology of cells obtained from the pleural space can be difficult to
assess because of mesothelial and macrophage abnormalities.  The diagnostic sensitivity
of pleural fluid cytology is approximately 65%, with a specificity of 97%.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Flow cytometry can be applied to these specimens and is
often useful, especially for assessment of lymphomas.  Thoracoscopy and pleural biopsy
are rarely needed for definitive diagnosis, but these techniques may be useful when routine pleural fluid
collection and assessment are difficult because of loculation of the effusion.  Thoracoscopy-guided biopsy is generally performed under local anesthesia and has a yield of more than 80%, with a lower risk of complications than thoracotomy.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_50"><Title>Management of Malignant Pleural Effusions</Title><SummarySection id="_51"><Title>To treat or not to treat</Title><Para id="_52">Pleural effusions are generally markers of advanced, unresectable disease or disease
progression.  The median survival for patients with malignant pleural effusions is around 3 to 4 months.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>   Because a paramalignant effusion resulting from pneumonia or atelectasis may be present, the cytology should be confirmed before major treatment decisions are made.  Once the cytology has been confirmed, the management strategy depends on the underlying primary malignancy and the number and type of previous therapies.  For example, patients with newly diagnosed small cell carcinoma or malignant lymphoma are very likely to respond to systemic chemotherapy; however, patients who have already failed several lines of chemotherapy for gastric or ovarian cancer are unlikely to obtain significant palliation with systemic therapy.  
</Para><Para id="_53">About three-quarters of patients exhibit symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, and chest discomfort.  Such patients may benefit from efforts to reduce the fluid burden, depending on their performance status, expected survival, and preference for risks versus benefits.
The literature on the efficacy of treatment for pleural effusions is difficult to interpret because of the paucity of randomized trials, and the wide variability in the response criteria and the timing and duration of follow-up in uncontrolled trials.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/>     Generally, the goal of therapy is palliation of symptoms.  Measures of success may include complete drainage of the effusion, lung re-expansion, lack of fluid reaccumulation (i.e., duration of response), and subjective report of symptom relief. The choice of treatment depends on patient prognosis, functional status,  and goals of care.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_54"><Title>Thoracentesis</Title><Para id="_55">Thoracentesis involves percutaneous insertion of a needle for drainage of the effusion.  Thoracentesis is not expected to permanently resolve the problem but rather to alleviate symptoms that are acute and severe.  The use of thoracentesis is also appropriate as a therapeutic trial to determine whether fluid drainage is beneficial when the relationship between symptoms and effusion is unclear.</Para><Para id="_56">Most effusions will reaccumulate a few days after thoracentesis. The reaccumulation rate is approximately 98% by day 30.<Reference refidx="8"/>  Repeated thoracenteses carry the potential risks of bleeding, infection, and pneumothorax.  Other potential complications of thoracentesis include noncardiogenic pulmonary edema from rapid lung re-expansion (usually with the rapid removal of &gt;1,500 cc) and pleural shock caused by an excessive vagal response to penetration of the parietal pleura.  Any of these complications may be lethal, especially for the cancer patient with poor cardiopulmonary reserve.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_193"><Title>Chronic long-term indwelling tunneled pleural catheters</Title><Para id="_194">Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) represent an alternative to pleurodesis for patients with malignant pleural effusion whose dyspnea has responded to thoracentesis.  IPCs are relatively contraindicated in patients with a short life expectancy, pleural infections, multiloculated collections, and chylothorax.   The insertion of chronic long-term indwelling tunneled pleural catheters is useful against recurrent and symptomatic malignant pleural effusions, including for patients with trapped lung.  These tunneled pleural catheters allow up to 96% of patients to achieve symptom improvement, with spontaneous pleurodesis occurring in up to 44% of patients.<Reference refidx="9"/> Published results indicate significantly shorter hospital stays (1 day) for patients with IPCs versus the doxycycline pleurodesis group (6 days).  In the IPC group, spontaneous pleurodesis was achieved in 42 of 91 patients. Both the IPC group and doxycycline pleurodesis group reported modest improvement in quality of life and dyspnea.<Reference refidx="10"/> A randomized controlled trial comparing IPC and talc pleurodesis showed similar reduction of dyspnea (24 mm of 100 mm) and similar quality of life.<Reference refidx="11"/> IPC use was associated with a shorter initial hospitalization and lower rates of re-treatment, with a spontaneous pleurodesis rate of 51%.  However, there were also higher rates of adverse effects, such as infections and catheter blockage. The choice between IPC and pleurodesis should be based on patient preference and local resource availability.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_57"><Title>Use of pleural sclerosing agents after chest tube drainage</Title><Para id="_58">Chemical sclerosants may be administered through a chest tube to create
inflammation and subsequent fusion of the parietal and visceral pleura so that fluid
cannot reaccumulate in this potential space. This kind of fusion is called pleurodesis.
Numerous chemical agents can cause the irritation necessary to produce pleurodesis.  The
ideal agent would produce effective pleurodesis with minimal cost and minimal side effects.

talc appear to be the most effective agents.<Reference refidx="25"/>   A prospective, randomized study of video-assisted thoracoscopic pleurodesis with talc versus doxycycline in 33 patients with malignant pleural effusion suggests that talc provides superior short-term and long-term results.<Reference refidx="26"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] Talc appears to be the least expensive agent, at least when given as a

recurrent pleural effusions.<Reference refidx="1"/> An observational cohort study investigated the use of intrapleural urokinase in 48 patients with loculated pleural effusions or trapped lungs. Lung reexpansion and resolution of dyspnea occurred in approximately 60% of patients, suggesting that intrapleural urokinase may be useful in treating loculated pleural effusions or trapped lungs in medically inoperable cancer patients.

aggressive treatment remains appropriate.  Pleuroperitoneal shunting can be considered
for these patients.  This procedure involves implantation of a shunt with one-way valves
that allow the transfer of fluid from the pleural space to the peritoneal space, in which the
fluid creates less  hazard and is more easily removed.  Another option is surgical
pleurectomy, but this procedure requires general anesthesia.  The risks of significant
acute and chronic pain as well as other morbidity approaches 20% to 25%, and the risk of
1-month mortality is 5% to 10%.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_TrialSearch_40_sid_4"><Title>Current Clinical Trials</Title><Para id="_TrialSearch_40_13">Check NCI’s list of cancer clinical trials for U.S. supportive and palliative care trials about

impairment of blood flow through the superior vena cava (SVC) to the right
atrium.  Symptoms that prompt suspicion of this syndrome include dyspnea,
coughing, and swelling of the face, neck, upper trunk, and extremities.  In rare
instances, patients may complain of hoarseness, chest pain, dysphagia, and
hemoptysis.  Physical signs that may be noted on presentation are neck vein
distention, thoracic vein distention, edema of the face or upper extremities,
plethora, and tachypnea.  Rarely, cyanosis, Horner syndrome, and a paralyzed
vocal cord may also be present.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_100">SVCS is usually a sign of locally advanced bronchogenic carcinoma.  Survival
depends on the status of the patient’s disease.  When small cell bronchogenic
carcinoma is treated with chemotherapy, the median survival times with or
without SVCS are almost identical (42 weeks or 40 weeks, respectively).  The 24-month
survival rate is 9% in patients without SVCS and 3% in those with the syndrome. 
When the malignancy is treated with radiation therapy, 46% of patients who have
non-small cell lung cancer experience relief of symptoms compared with 62% of
patients who have small cell bronchogenic carcinoma.  The 2-year survival rate of 5%
is almost the same for both groups.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_101">Most non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients with SVCS respond to appropriate
chemotherapy or to combined modality regimens.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_102"><Title>Etiology and Physiology</Title><Para id="_103">Since SVCS was first described by William Hunter
in 1757, the spectrum of underlying conditions associated with it has shifted
from tuberculosis and syphilitic aneurysms of the ascending aorta to malignant
disorders.  Almost 95% of SVCS cases described in published modern series result from cancer; the most common cause is small cell bronchogenic carcinoma,
followed by squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, adenocarcinoma of the lung,
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and large cell carcinoma of the lung.<Reference refidx="3"/>  A
nonmalignant cause of SVCS in cancer patients is thrombosis that is associated
with intracaval catheters or pacemaker wires.<Reference refidx="4"/> A rare cause of SVCS is
fibrosing mediastinitis, either idiopathic or associated with
histoplasmosis.<Reference refidx="5"/> Additional rare causes of SVCS include metastatic germ cell
neoplasms, metastatic breast cancer, colon cancer, Kaposi sarcoma, esophageal
carcinoma, fibrous mesothelioma, Behçet syndrome, thymoma, substernal thyroid
goiter, Hodgkin lymphoma, and sarcoidosis.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_104">Knowledge of the anatomy of the SVC and its relationship
to the surrounding lymph nodes is essential to understanding the development of
the syndrome.  The SVC is formed by the junction of the left and right
brachiocephalic veins in the mid third of the mediastinum.  The SVC extends
caudally for 6 to 8 cm, coursing anterior to the right mainstem bronchus and terminating in the superior right atrium, and extends
anteriorly to the right mainstem bronchus.  The SVC is joined posteriorly by
the azygos vein as it loops over the right mainstem bronchus and lies posterior
to and to the right of the ascending aorta.  The mediastinal parietal pleura is
lateral to the SVC, creating a confined space, and the SVC is adjacent to the
right paratracheal, azygous, right hilar, and subcarinal lymph node groups. 
The vessel itself is thin-walled, and the blood flowing therein is under low
pressure.  Thus, when the nodes or ascending aorta enlarge, the SVC is
compressed, blood flow slows, and complete occlusion may occur.</Para><Para id="_105">The severity of the syndrome depends on the rapidity of onset of the
obstruction and its location.  The more rapid the onset, the more severe the
symptoms because the collateral veins do not have time to distend to
accommodate an increased blood flow.  If the obstruction is above the entry of
the azygos vein, the syndrome is less pronounced because the azygous venous
system can readily distend to accommodate the shunted blood with less venous
pressure developing in the head, arms, and upper thorax.  If the obstruction is
below the entry of the azygos vein, more florid symptoms and signs are seen
because the blood must be returned to the heart via the upper abdominal veins
and the inferior vena cava, which requires higher venous pressure.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_106">One study suggested that the general recruitment of venous collaterals over
time may lead to remission of the syndrome, although the SVC remains
obstructed.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_107"><Title>Assessment and Diagnosis</Title><Para id="_108">Once SVCS is recognized, prompt clinical
attention is important.  For the following reasons, a diagnosis should be established before

not justified.</Para><Para id="_111">The initial evaluation of the patient should include a chest x-ray to look
for mediastinal masses and associated findings, such as pleural effusion, lobar
collapse, or cardiomegaly.  Computed tomography (CT) scanning of the thorax
yields the most useful diagnostic information and can define the anatomy of the
involved mediastinal nodes.  Venous patency and the presence of thrombi are
assessed by using contrast and rapid scanning techniques.<Reference refidx="9"/> Depending on
local expertise, contrast or nuclear venography, magnetic resonance imaging,
and ultrasound may be valuable in assessing the site and nature of the
obstruction.</Para><Para id="_112">If bronchogenic carcinoma is suspected, a sputum specimen should be obtained. 
If the sputum specimen is negative, a biopsy specimen should be taken from the
most accessible site that is clinically involved with disease.  The biopsy
approach depends on the working diagnosis, the location of the tumor, the
physiologic status of the patient, and the expertise available at the facility. 
It may include bronchoscopy, biopsy of palpable cervical or supraclavicular
lymph nodes, needle biopsy of a lung mass or mediastinal nodes using either CT
or ultrasound guidance, mediastinoscopy, mediastinotomy, median sternotomy,

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_113"><Title>Treatment Options</Title><Para id="_114">The treatment of SVCS depends on the etiology of
the obstruction, the severity of the symptoms, the prognosis of the patient,
and patient preferences and goals for therapy.  Radiation therapy or
chemotherapy should be withheld until the etiology of the obstruction is clear. 
The treatments discussed here focus on SVC
obstruction caused by a malignant tumor.  Because the treatment of malignant
obstruction may depend on tumor histology, a histologic diagnosis—if not made
earlier—should be made before treatment is initiated.  Unless there is
airway obstruction or cerebral edema, there appears to be no detriment in
outcome when treatment is delayed for the assessment.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/>  The following
treatment approaches can be used for SVCS.</Para><SummarySection id="_115"><Title>Medical management</Title><Para id="_116">A patient with sufficient collateral blood flow and minimal symptoms may not
need treatment.  If the lesion is above the azygous vein or if the onset of SVC
occlusion is slow enough to allow sufficient collateral circulation, the
symptoms and signs may stabilize, and the patient may be comfortable enough to
forego further therapy.  Short-term palliation of a symptomatic patient who
does not want aggressive treatment may be achieved by elevating the head and
using corticosteroids and diuresis. There are no definitive studies that prove the
effectiveness of steroids,  although steroids are potentially useful to treat
respiratory compromise.  Diuretics may give symptomatic relief of edema but
can ultimately cause systemic complications, such as dehydration.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="16"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_117"><Title>Radiation therapy</Title><Para id="_118">If the obstruction of the SVC is caused by a tumor that is not
sensitive to chemotherapy, radiation therapy should be given.  Treatment with
larger fractions of radiation is thought to be beneficial in developing a rapid
response.  One study shows, however, that there is no obvious need for large
radiation fraction sizes for the first few radiation treatments as was
previously believed.<Reference refidx="17"/> Many fractionation schemes have been used, with doses
ranging from 30 Gy in 10 fractions to 50 Gy in 25 fractions.  Relief of
symptoms in small cell lung cancer is reported to be 62% to 80%, whereas in non-small cell lung cancer, approximately 46% of the patients experienced
symptomatic relief.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="18"/>  In one study, more than 90% of the patients
achieved a partial or complete response with a 3-week regimen of 8 Gy given
once a week for a total dose of 24 Gy.<Reference refidx="19"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_119"><Title>Chemotherapy</Title><Para id="_120">Chemotherapy is the treatment of choice for sensitive tumors such as lymphoma
or small cell lung cancer.  SVCS does not appear to be an independent
prognostic factor, and its presence should not change the treatment
approach.  Rapid initiation of chemotherapy can result in complete and partial
response rates of the SVCS of more than 80% in small cell lung cancer
patients.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="18"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_121"><Title>Thrombolysis</Title><Para id="_122">It has been suggested that SVCS arises when a thrombus forms in a partially
occluded vein.  In patients with a documented thrombus in the SVC, treatment
may include thrombectomy, with or without tissue plasminogen activator or
other thrombolytic agents such as streptokinase or urokinase.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_123"><Title>Stent placement</Title><Para id="_124">There have been numerous small studies using an intravascular expandable stent
to reopen the occluded SVC; however, no prospectively designed comparative
studies have been published.<Reference refidx="20"/> The reported response rates have been about
90% or greater.<Reference refidx="21"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]  There is no agreement on the need for anticoagulant
therapy after stent placement.  In one series that used anticoagulant therapy
for patients as part of the treatment protocol, there were reports of
reocclusion after this therapy was stopped.<Reference refidx="22"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] However, in another study, 17
cancer patients who were treated with stents and who did not have anticoagulant
therapy had no occlusions.<Reference refidx="23"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_125"><Title>Surgery</Title><Para id="_128">Surgical bypass of an obstructed SVC is more appropriate for patients with a
benign obstruction than with a malignant obstruction,<Reference refidx="24"/> although surgical
bypass has also been used for patients with malignant obstructions.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_127"><Title>Psychosocial Considerations</Title><Para id="_129">Patients and family members are often frightened and anxious because of the
symptoms produced by SVCS, particularly swelling,
dysphagia, coughing, and hoarseness.  Information about the cause of the symptoms and about short-term
measures for palliation is needed by patients and family members, especially during the diagnostic period.  When
aggressive treatment is declined because of the terminal nature of the
underlying disease, symptom management approaches
 may need to be taught to patients and family members.</Para><Para id="_138">Because most adult patients who develop SVCS have lung cancer, the treatment
and psychologic support approaches that are developed for SVCS should take into
account the patient’s prognosis and psychologic condition, goals of care, and other symptoms
caused by the malignancy.<Reference refidx="25"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_130"><Title>Pediatric Considerations</Title><Para id="_131">As described in other sections of this summary, SVCS refers to the symptoms associated with the compression or obstruction of
the SVC; the compression of the trachea is termed superior
mediastinal syndrome (SMS).  Because SMS and the resulting respiratory
compromise frequently occur in children with SVCS, the two syndromes have
become almost synonymous in pediatric practice.<Reference refidx="26"/><Reference refidx="27"/>  In adults, the trachea
and the right mainstem bronchus are relatively rigid structures compared with
the vena cava, but in children these structures are more susceptible to
compression.  In addition, the relatively smaller intraluminal diameters of a
child’s trachea and bronchus can tolerate little edema before respiratory
symptoms occur.  Because of this accompanying respiratory component, SVCS in
children differs from the adult syndrome and constitutes a serious medical
emergency.</Para><Para id="_132">The most common symptoms of SVCS in children are similar to those in adults and
include coughing, hoarseness, dyspnea, orthopnea, and chest pain.  Symptoms
that are less common but more serious are anxiety, confusion, lethargy,
headache, distorted vision, a sense of fullness in the ears, and, especially,
syncope.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para><Para id="_133">SVCS is rare in children and appears at presentation in 12% of pediatric
patients with malignant mediastinal tumors.<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/>  The etiology, diagnosis, and
treatment of SVCS in children differs from that in adults.  Whereas the most
frequent cause of SVCS in adults is bronchogenic carcinoma,<Reference refidx="3"/> in children the
most frequent malignant cause of the syndrome is non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  As in
adults, a frequent nonmalignant cause is thrombosis from catheterization for
venous access.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para><Para id="_134">A physical examination, chest radiograph, and the medical history of the
patient are usually sufficient to establish a diagnosis of SVCS.  If lymphoma
or other malignant disease is suspected, it is desirable to obtain a tissue
sample for diagnosis.  However, the procedure to obtain the specimen may
involve significant risk and may not be clinically feasible.  Children with
SVCS have a poor tolerance for the necessary general anesthesia because the
accompanying cardiovascular and pulmonary changes aggravate the SVCS, often
making intubation impossible.  Also, extubation may be difficult or impossible,
thus requiring prolonged airway provision (intubation).  A CT
scan of the chest to determine tracheal size, upright and supine
echocardiography, and a flow volume loop may help evaluate anesthetic risk. 
Because anesthesia use is a serious risk, the diagnosis should be made with the
least invasive means possible.<Reference refidx="30"/> Published reports suggest a stepwise
approach to diagnosis.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para><Para id="_135">When a malignant mass is the cause of the SVCS, the situation may be a medical
emergency with no opportunity to establish a tissue diagnosis.  In these cases,
the most appropriate course may be to initiate empiric therapy prior to biopsy. 
The traditional empiric therapy is irradiation, with the daily dose governed by
the presumed radiosensitivity of the tumor.  After irradiation, respiratory
deterioration from the apparent tracheal swelling may occur because of the
inability of narrow lumens in children to accommodate edema and because of the
greater degree of edema at onset, which is the result of the rapid speed at which
tumors grow in children.  In these situations, a course of prednisone at 10 mg/m<Superscript>2</Superscript> of body surface area 4 times per day may be necessary.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para><Para id="_136">In addition to radiation, empiric therapy of SVCS has included chemotherapeutic
agents incorporating steroids, cyclophosphamide, or both in combination with an
anthracycline and vincristine.<Reference refidx="26"/>  If the tumor fails to respond, it may be a
benign lesion.</Para><Para id="_137">If surgery becomes necessary, it should be performed with the patient in the
semi-Fowler’s position, allowing the surgeon the ability to rapidly change the patient's position to lateral
or prone.  Cardiopulmonary bypass facilities and a rigid bronchoscope should be
available in a standby capacity.<Reference refidx="30"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="8257336" MedlineID="94079583">Gauden SJ: Superior vena cava syndrome induced by bronchogenic carcinoma: is this an oncological emergency?
