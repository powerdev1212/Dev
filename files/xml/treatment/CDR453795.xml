The <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045864">regimen</GlossaryTermRef> also includes <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044711">prescribed</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044660">diets</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000463726">nutritional supplements</GlossaryTermRef>, and  coffee <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044204">enemas</GlossaryTermRef>  (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000453795#_31" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/gonzalez-pdq">Question 1</SummaryRef>). 
</ListItem><ListItem>The Gonzalez regimen is based on the theory that pancreatic enzymes help the body get rid of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046622">toxins</GlossaryTermRef> (harmful substances) that lead to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef> (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000453795#_35" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/gonzalez-pdq">Question 3</SummaryRef>).
</ListItem><ListItem> A few studies have examined the effect of pancreatic enzymes in animals with implanted cancers, but it is not possible to test many other parts of the Gonzalez regimen this way. (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000453795#_39" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/gonzalez-pdq">Question 5</SummaryRef>).
</ListItem><ListItem>In an early small study of Dr. Gonzalez's patients with <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000478743">advanced</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044521">pancreatic cancer</GlossaryTermRef>, he reported that patients on his regimen lived  longer than most people with the same type of cancer (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000453795#_41" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/gonzalez-pdq">Question 6</SummaryRef>). 
</ListItem><ListItem>A later     <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044160">nonrandomized</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044014">controlled clinical trial</GlossaryTermRef>  compared the effectiveness of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044930">standard treatment</GlossaryTermRef> with that of the Gonzalez regimen in patients whose pancreatic cancer  could not be removed by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045570">surgery</GlossaryTermRef>. Patients treated with standard <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045214">chemotherapy</GlossaryTermRef> survived an average of 14 months and patients treated with the Gonzalez regimen survived only an average of 4.3 months.  In addition, patients treated with chemotherapy reported a better <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef> than those treated with the Gonzalez regimen (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000453795#_41" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/gonzalez-pdq">Question 6</SummaryRef>).

Later, William Kelley, a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000389460">dentist</GlossaryTermRef>, further developed Dr. Beard’s ideas and published the results of his own practice. Impressed by these findings, Dr. Gonzalez began working closely with Dr. Kelley. The Gonzalez regimen combines the work of Dr. Gonzalez and Dr. Kelley with the theories and practice of Dr. Max Gerson. Dr. Gerson also treated cancer with diet and nutritional supplements.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_35"><Question>What is the theory behind the claim that the Gonzalez regimen is useful in treating cancer?</Question><Answer><Para id="_52">Supporters of the Gonzalez regimen believe that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046622">toxins</GlossaryTermRef> (harmful substances) in the environment and in processed foods cause cancer to form in the body. These toxins are said to build up in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissues</GlossaryTermRef> of the body, preventing important body processes from working correctly and letting cancer develop. The theory is that if these toxins could be destroyed and removed from the body, cancer would stop growing.</Para><Para id="_53">The <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046254">pancreas</GlossaryTermRef> secretes enzymes, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046092">proteins</GlossaryTermRef> that help digest food. The Gonzalez regimen is based on the theory that pancreatic enzymes also help the body get rid of toxins that lead to cancer. The coffee enemas are added because they are believed to improve the liver’s ability to remove toxins from the body.</Para><Para id="_54">The diets used in the Gonzalez regimen are planned for each patient’s <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000446118">metabolic type</GlossaryTermRef>. Metabolic typing is a theory that people fall into one of three groups based on the main type of food (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046092">protein</GlossaryTermRef>,   <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000285960">carb</GlossaryTermRef>, or mixed) that their bodies need to stay healthy. The developer uses certain tests, including looking at the patient’s hair under a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000638184">microscope,</GlossaryTermRef> to decide a patient’s metabolic type. The theory is that a diet that is correct for the patient’s metabolic type will keep the body healthy and better able to prevent or fight cancer.  
</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_37"><Question>How is the Gonzalez regimen administered?</Question><Answer><Para id="_38">The pancreatic enzyme is taken by mouth, in a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000455334">capsule</GlossaryTermRef>. Between 130 and 160 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044664">doses</GlossaryTermRef> of other nutritional supplements are taken by mouth each day. The patients also eat a special diet and have coffee enemas twice a day.  </Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_39"><Question>Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using the Gonzalez regimen?</Question><Answer><Para id="_55">Research in a laboratory or using animals is done to find out if a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000348921">drug</GlossaryTermRef>, procedure, or treatment is likely to be useful in humans. These <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044517">preclinical studies</GlossaryTermRef> are done before any testing in humans is begun. <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454774">Animal studies</GlossaryTermRef> of the Gonzalez regimen looked at the effect of pancreatic enzymes in cancer treatment, but did not study the regimen as a whole. There has been preclinical testing on the effects of pancreatic enzymes in several cancers:</Para><ItemizedList id="_56" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>In 1999, an animal study tested the effect of different doses of pancreatic enzymes taken by mouth on the growth and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046710">metastasis</GlossaryTermRef> (spread) of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000444971">breast cancer</GlossaryTermRef> in rats. Some of the rats received magnesium citrate in addition to the enzymes. Rats receiving the enzymes were compared to rats that did not receive the enzymes.<ItemizedList id="_57" Style="dash"><ListItem>Results showed that the enzyme did not affect growth of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045847">primary tumor</GlossaryTermRef> (where the cancer started). 
</ListItem><ListItem>The cancer spread to the most places in the rats that received the highest <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044664">dose</GlossaryTermRef> of enzymes. 
</ListItem><ListItem>The cancer spread to the fewest places in the rats that received the lowest dose of enzymes plus magnesium citrate.</ListItem></ItemizedList> 
</ListItem><ListItem>Another animal study looked at the effects of pancreatic enzymes on <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044301">survival rates</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumor</GlossaryTermRef> growth in rats with pancreatic cancer. Rats receiving the enzyme treatment lived longer, had smaller tumors and fewer signs of disease, and were more active than the rats in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044149">control group</GlossaryTermRef>, which did not receive the enzyme. </ListItem></ItemizedList></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_41"><Question>Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) of the Gonzalez regimen been conducted?</Question><Answer><Para id="_40">Nicholas Gonzalez, a New York physician, first studied his regimen in 11 patients who had advanced pancreatic cancer. In 1993, he reported selected results of the study to the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044266">National Cancer Institute</GlossaryTermRef> (NCI). Patients treated with the Gonzalez regimen lived a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000655249">median</GlossaryTermRef> of 17 months, which is longer than usual for patients with this disease. Most patients with advanced pancreatic cancer live less than a year.</Para><Para id="_58">Because of the small number of patients in the study, and for other reasons, the NCI and the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) decided that the results were not clear and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044079">prospective studies</GlossaryTermRef> were encouraged. In prospective studies, patients are followed forward in time. The NCI and  the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454777">National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health</GlossaryTermRef> (NCCIH) sponsored a second study with a much larger number of patients. This was a 7-year <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044195">clinical study</GlossaryTermRef> that included patients who had <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045490">stage II</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045497">stage III</GlossaryTermRef>, or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045511">stage IV pancreatic cancer</GlossaryTermRef> that could not be removed by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045570">surgery</GlossaryTermRef>. 
</Para><Para id="_59">In this study, one group of patients followed the Gonzalez regimen while another group was given <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044930">standard treatment</GlossaryTermRef> (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045214">chemotherapy</GlossaryTermRef>). Results in the two groups were compared to see if the Gonzalez regimen works better than the standard treatment and if it has bad <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046580">side effects</GlossaryTermRef>. Results of the study were reported in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000537399">peer-reviewed</GlossaryTermRef> <ExternalRef xref="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19687327?dopt=Abstract">Journal of Clinical Oncology</ExternalRef> in April 2010. Patients treated with standard chemotherapy survived a median of 14 months and patients treated with the Gonzalez regimen survived a median of 4.3 months. Patients treated with chemotherapy reported a better <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef> than those treated with the Gonzalez regimen. Dr. Gonzalez published <ExternalRef xref="http://www.dr-gonzalez.com/jco_rebuttal.htm">comments</ExternalRef> on his Web site to express concerns about how the trial was conducted.  One concern was how well patients in the Gonzalez regimen group actually followed the regimen.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_43"><Question>Have any side effects or risks been reported from the Gonzalez regimen?</Question><Answer><Para id="_60">The reported side effects of treatment with the Gonzalez regimen are the following:

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_2"><Title>General CAM Information</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_3">Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also referred to as integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_4">Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_5">Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. </Para></SummarySection> 
  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_6"><Title>Evaluation of CAM Approaches</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_7">It is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute  and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_8">Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH)  in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.</Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_9"><ExternalRef xref="http://cam.cancer.gov/cam/best_case_intro.html">The NCI Best Case Series Program</ExternalRef>   which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.</Para></SummarySection>
