Overall survival rates vary depending on cancer type, patient age, and other patient characteristics.<Reference refidx="1"/> With these improved outcomes, the focus of research and expectations of patients, parents, and health care providers has increasingly emphasized reducing the burden of cancer and its treatment for these children during treatment, after the completion of treatment, and as adult survivors.</Para><Para id="_11">Cancer treatment for children differs in many ways from treatment for adults. Some of the principal differences include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_12" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem><Emphasis>Intensity.</Emphasis> In general, treatment of childhood cancer is more intense. Because the dose-limiting toxicities of most chemotherapy and radiation treatments are generally reached at higher doses, more-intensive chemotherapy and radiation therapy are feasible for children than would be possible for adults.</ListItem><ListItem>	<Emphasis>Toxicity.</Emphasis> Some of the toxicities of treatment have a much more significant and lasting effect on children than on adults because of the active development of nearly all organ systems during childhood and adolescence.</ListItem><ListItem><Emphasis>Supportive Care.</Emphasis> Developmental differences extend to the types of supportive care that children may receive. Medications that represent standards of care for adult cancer supportive care may be contraindicated for children because of adverse toxicities that are associated with specific periods of childhood development.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_13">Fundamental to these differences is the clear recognition that children are not small adults and that even the term <Emphasis>children</Emphasis> is not all-encompassing. Treatment and supportive care require different approaches across the spectrum from newborn through young adult age groups, and the outcomes of both cancer survivorship (control of disease) and quality of survivorship (impact of toxicities) differ with the age of a child at the time of treatment.</Para><Para id="_14">Equally important is the recognition that treatment of childhood cancer inevitably occurs in the context of a family. Frequently, the impact of an adult’s cancer treatment focuses on one or two key adults in the cancer patient’s life. In childhood cancer, the effects are often felt by more individuals, including one or both parents, one or more siblings who are themselves children or adolescents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, teachers, friends, and other individuals who may be directly involved in the care or life experience of the child. Furthermore, because children are not considered legally competent exclusively on the basis of age, most decisions about cancer treatment are made by proxy. Instead of children making decisions about their own care, their parents or guardians make these decisions for them. The large number of people involved, legal issues related to decision making about minors by others, and ethical concerns about informed consent and assent involving children add extra layers to the complexity of treatment for children.</Para><Para id="_15">In this pediatric supportive care summary, issues specifically related to children and adolescents will be reviewed. Evidence and recommendations may differ significantly from information provided about supportive care for adults.</Para><Para id="_16">Topics addressed include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_17" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Psychological adjustment and treatment of psychological adjustment problems.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_55">The following information will be added to the summary as it is completed:</Para><ItemizedList id="_56" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Pain and distress, particularly related to painful procedures.</ListItem><ListItem>Acute toxicity issues.</ListItem><ListItem>Neurodevelopment and learning.</ListItem><ListItem>Growth and physical development.</ListItem><ListItem>Impact of cancer treatment on families and family members.</ListItem><ListItem>Long-term survivorship.</ListItem></ItemizedList><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">American Cancer Society: Cancer Facts and Figures 2015.

It is therefore assumed that children undergoing cancer treatment are at significantly higher risk for depression, anxiety, and other indicators of psychological distress. However, the empirical evidence to support this assumption is weak. Overall, studies suggest that children treated for cancer and children who are long-term survivors of cancer experience few significant psychological adjustment problems.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_18">There is evidence that children experience distress during the cancer treatment process. Distress appears to be most significant early in therapy, typically when frequent hospitalizations are necessary, with a pattern of less distress occurring over time.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>  One group of 39 families of children newly diagnosed with leukemia was compared with a group of 49 families of healthy children. While parents and the children treated for cancer reported higher levels of distress immediately following diagnosis, these levels of distress decreased over 4 years of follow-up, and there were no significant differences in psychological distress compared with the healthy comparison cohort.<Reference refidx="4"/> Similar findings have been reported across cultures.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_19">The validity of obtaining accurate reports of psychologic distress in this population has been questioned. One investigation of whether psychological defensiveness might mask the reporting of depression and other symptoms of psychological distress studied 107 children treated for cancer and 422 healthy controls who completed a series of measures of depression and anxiety.<Reference refidx="7"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] Children treated for cancer reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms than did healthy children, and defensive style was not related to report of depression. Another study of 205 children and 321 parents of children with either cancer, asthma, or no significant health problem also found no significant levels of depression in children treated for cancer. However, parents of children with cancer attributed more cheerful characteristics to their children than did the parents of children in the other groups.<Reference refidx="8"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_20">Studies have reported no differences from controls on the following measures:</Para><ItemizedList id="_86" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Self-esteem.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/></ListItem><ListItem> Hopefulness.<Reference refidx="9"/></ListItem><ListItem>Depression, anxiety, or loneliness.<Reference refidx="10"/></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_87">One group of investigators <Reference refidx="10"/> found that teachers perceived children with cancer as more social and less aggressive, and peers rated them as less aggressive and having greater social acceptance than other peers. It may make a difference who is reporting: parents of children report more limitations in their children than the children themselves report,<Reference refidx="11"/> although children do report lower satisfaction with athletic competence than do their peers.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><SummarySection id="_88"><Title>Differences in Adjustment</Title><Para id="_89">Diagnosis and type of treatment appear to make a difference in adjustment in specific subgroups of children with cancer.<Reference refidx="12"/> </Para><SummarySection id="_90"><Title>Solid tumors</Title><Para id="_91">Children treated for solid tumors not involving the central nervous system (CNS) appear to have minimal psychological distress, and this is maintained after treatment.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_92"><Title>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma</Title><Para id="_93">Children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoma report poorer emotional functioning, cognitive skills, autonomy, and family interaction than do children treated for non-CNS solid tumors.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_94"><Title>CNS tumors</Title><Para id="_95">For children whose disease or treatment directly involves the CNS, the risk of developing social and emotional problems appears much greater. Children with brain tumors are seen by their peers as being sick, fatigued, absent from school, and socially isolated and are less likely to be endorsed as friends by their peers.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_96"><Title>Stem cell transplantation</Title><Para id="_97">Children receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are likely to experience declines in both social competence and self-concept over time.<Reference refidx="15"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_98"><Title>Ethnicity</Title><Para id="_99">Ethnicity can also play a role in quality of life.<Reference refidx="16"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_42"><Title>Family Factors</Title><Para id="_43">Family factors appear to play a large role in child adjustment, with family cohesion and expressiveness associated with better outcomes and family conflict associated with poorer outcomes, particularly for children experiencing more-intensive treatment.<Reference refidx="15"/> Younger (pre-school) children are more likely to experience higher levels of externalizing behavior problems (e.g., aggression, impulsivity, or disruptive behavior) during treatment than do adolescents, but overall health-related quality of life (HRQL) reported by parents is better for younger children than for adolescents.<Reference refidx="17"/> Age may also serve as a mediator in the approach to coping and perceived level of control experienced by children being treated for cancer. While one group of researchers found that children with cancer reported significantly more use of avoidant coping strategies than did healthy children, regardless of age,<Reference refidx="18"/> another group found that the relationship between perceived control and problem-focused or emotion-focused coping (problem-focused coping related to higher appraisals of control) was mediated by age.<Reference refidx="19"/> A limited number of studies has been conducted in this area, and there are likely a number of additional mediators of adjustment-coping relationships that have not yet been examined.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_44"><Title>Childhood Cancer Survivor Study</Title><Para id="_45">The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is a large, ongoing, multicenter study of more than 10,000 long-term survivors of childhood cancer and a comparison sibling control population. Using extensive survey methodology that links reports of current functioning to diagnosis, types of treatment, and other health factors associated with cancer and its treatment, the CCSS has selectively looked at long-term adjustment in large samples of young adults treated for similar childhood cancers. In one CCSS report, 2,778 survivors of solid tumors diagnosed in childhood and 2,925 siblings were surveyed using a standardized long-term follow-up questionnaire. Symptoms associated with depression, somatization, and anxiety were reported, along with demographic, health, and medical information. Few, if any, symptoms of psychological distress were reported by the cancer survivors, although survivors of solid-tumor cancers reported higher levels of global distress than did their siblings. There were no differences on these measures from population norms. For both cancer survivors and their siblings, female gender, lower education and income attainment, perceived poor health status, and reports of current health problems were all associated with higher levels of psychological distress symptoms.<Reference refidx="20"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_46">Positive findings also have been reported by the CCSS for young adults who are survivors of leukemias and lymphomas. Follow-up questionnaires about psychological adjustment were administered to 5,736 young adult survivors of leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and Hodgkin disease and to 2,565 adult siblings. Survivors reported higher levels of depressive symptoms and somatic distress than did siblings, but scores for neither group fell within the clinically significant range for the general population. Sociodemographic factors such as gender and socioeconomic status were associated with reports of depressive symptoms, regardless of treatment status. The only disease-related factor associated with psychological distress was intensive chemotherapy, which was associated with an increase in somatic complaints.<Reference refidx="2"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] Similar outcomes were reported for survivors of brain cancers. Brain tumor survivors reported higher levels of depressive symptomatology than did siblings, but the rates for both groups were similar to rates for the general population.<Reference refidx="3"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] A summary of the main psychosocial outcomes reported by the CCSS is available.<Reference refidx="21"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]  Other reports  from the CCSS address alcohol consumption,<Reference refidx="22"/> the role of physical limitations on HRQL,<Reference refidx="23"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]  fatigue, and sleep.<Reference refidx="24"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_58"><Title>Depression and Suicide</Title><Para id="_59">Young adult survivors of childhood cancer may have an elevated risk for suicidality. A report from Eastern Europe compared the responses of 228 long-term survivors of childhood cancer with those of 127 controls to the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the Suicidal Ideation and Behaviour Questionnaire. The rates of depressive symptoms reported by the childhood cancer survivors were three times the rates reported by the controls, with 13% indicating some level of suicidal ideation.<Reference refidx="25"/> Similarly, 226 adult survivors of childhood cancer seen in a survivor clinic completed the Short Form-36 (SF-36), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and suicide items from the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) and the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS). The measures assessed whether the survivors had ever attempted suicide or whether they had experienced significant suicidal ideation within the past week; 29 participants (12.83%) reported suicidality. Suicidality was associated with younger age at diagnosis, longer time since diagnosis, cranial radiation therapy, a diagnosis of leukemia, pain, and concerns about physical appearance. Current physical condition, including pain, was associated with suicidality.<Reference refidx="26"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] These studies represent relatively small samples with small comparison groups and may reflect a reporting bias represented in individuals who actively attend follow-up clinics. Nonetheless, while these results are inconsistent with other findings related to psychological distress, they do suggest the need for ongoing monitoring and surveillance of adults who are survivors of childhood cancer.</Para><Para id="_121">Significant concern about the potential for suicide as a side effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue a caution about their use that includes the importance of careful monitoring of potential risks.<Reference refidx="27"/> Before this FDA Health Advisory was issued, clinical experience and the  results of small clinical trials suggested that antidepressants can be safely administered to adult cancer patients, although there are no controlled clinical trials to support this position.   The risk/benefit ratio for use of SSRIs may not be as favorable for children and adolescents.   Several multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials using SSRIs with children and adolescents with major depressive disorder but not cancer found modest improvements for fluoxetine,<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/> paroxetine,<Reference refidx="30"/> and sertraline.<Reference refidx="31"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] Balancing these improvements were reports of serious adverse events  that included worsening of psychiatric symptoms, increased suicidal ideation and gestures, increased conduct problems or hostility with paroxetine,<Reference refidx="30"/>  and suicide and suicide attempts with sertraline.<Reference refidx="31"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_122">None of these clinical trials have included or focused on children and adolescents being treated for cancer.  Risk/benefit concerns have  reached the level of international regulatory concern. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency of Great Britain has recommended that most of the drugs in the SSRI category not be used with children and adolescents,<Reference refidx="32"/>  and the FDA  raised similar concerns in  a Talk Paper and subsequently issued a “black box” warning.<Reference refidx="27"/> A major meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association reanalyzed the data from the child and adolescent studies <Reference refidx="33"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] (including seven studies not included in the initial meta-analysis <Reference refidx="34"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]) using a random-effects model. While this reanalysis  found an overall increased risk of suicidal ideation/suicide attempt consistent with the initial meta-analysis, the pooled risk differences were found to be smaller and statistically insignificant.<Reference refidx="33"/>    Furthermore, another study examining the U.S. and Dutch data suggests a drop in SSRI prescriptions for children and adolescents and a simultaneous increase in suicide rates in this patient population since the FDA Health Advisory was issued.<Reference refidx="35"/></Para><Para id="_124">  In summary, the risk/benefit equation favors appropriate use of antidepressants with careful monitoring for suicidality.<Reference refidx="36"/>       The British Committee on Safety of Medicines considered only one of the SSRIs (fluoxetine) to have a favorable balance of risks and benefits, but it is only considered beneficial in approximately one in ten patients.<Reference refidx="37"/> Consistent with this finding, age-stratified analyses of the child and adolescent studies found that for children younger than 12 years who have major depression, only fluoxetine showed benefit over placebo.<Reference refidx="33"/></Para><Para id="_123">As noted, none of the children or adolescents in these studies had cancer, so there are no reports available that address whether there are additional increased risks of adverse events associated with the use of SSRIs following exposure to different chemotherapeutic agents and/or CNS radiation treatment.  Frontline, alternative, effective, behavioral, and pharmacologic treatments for depression should be used for children and adolescents being treated for cancer.  However, if the risks of depression are significant and SSRIs are considered,  consultation with a child psychiatrist or neurologist is essential, and close monitoring of potential adverse events is crucial.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_60"><Title>Post-traumatic Stress Disorder and Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms</Title><Para id="_61">The cancer treatment experience may be considered a significant traumatic event, given the nature of diagnosis, the number of invasive and painful procedures, and the often long hospitalizations that children and their families must experience. On the basis of this exposure model, a number of studies have examined whether children treated for cancer are at a significantly higher risk for the development of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The results of these studies have been mixed.<Reference refidx="38"/> One study reported that children and adolescents who were undergoing treatment reported some symptoms of post-traumatic stress; however, for most children these symptoms did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, and the symptoms diminished over time.<Reference refidx="39"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_62">Other studies suggest that survivors of childhood cancer have an increased risk for post-traumatic stress symptoms and PTSD after treatment is finished. In a study of 78 adults aged 18 to 41 years who had been treated for childhood cancer, 20.5% met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD at some time since the end of their treatment. Clinically significant events of intrusive symptoms (9%) and avoidant symptoms (16.7%) were reported in the sample, and the symptoms were associated with elevated reports of anxiety and other measures of psychologic distress.<Reference refidx="40"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] Survivors who report higher levels of uncertainty about their disease and future appear to be more likely to have elevated reports of post-traumatic stress symptoms.<Reference refidx="41"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]<Reference refidx="42"/> A study of 182 adolescent and young adult cancer survivors who were more than 5 years from diagnosis and more than 2 years from completion of cancer treatment also found that 16% met the criteria for PTSD. A relationship between PTSD and higher levels of other psychological problems was also reported.<Reference refidx="43"/> When survivors meet the criteria for PTSD, they are more likely to experience depression and negative affect, lower satisfaction with life, and poorer reported HRQL, as well as difficulty performing developmental tasks.<Reference refidx="44"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="10980049">Eiser C, Hill JJ, Vance YH: Examining the psychological consequences of surviving childhood cancer: systematic review as a research method in pediatric psychology.

However, the effects of having a child or sibling with cancer are not uniform, either for all family members or at all points in the treatment process, and the literature reflects the variability of each family member’s experience.</Para><SummarySection id="_30"><Title>Parents</Title><Para id="_31">The diagnosis of childhood cancer represents the start of a period of substantial distress for parents, who report shock, emotional pain, difficulty coping with the necessary procedures performed on their child, rumination, and high levels of information seeking accompanied by a sense of lack of control.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/> One study found that all but one participant in a sample of 119 mothers and 52 fathers of children undergoing cancer treatment reported traumatic stress symptoms such as intrusive thoughts, physiologic arousal, and avoidance.<Reference refidx="4"/> When parents of children undergoing treatment (n = 175) were compared with parents of children who had completed treatment (n = 238), symptoms of traumatic stress (intrusion, arousal) were reported more frequently by the parents during the acute phase of treatment than by the parents after treatment, though some parents reported these symptoms after treatment. Some demographic factors may play a role in the degree to which parents experienced significant stress that impairs function. Mothers were more likely to report higher levels of stress than were fathers, and parents with fewer years of formal education and lower socioeconomic status were more likely to experience traumatic stress at any time.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_32">Patterns of parental stress in families of children treated for cancer differ from those in families of children treated for other diseases. In one large study of 675 parents of children who were treated for cancer or diabetes or who were healthy, parents of children with cancer reported significantly higher levels of distress—as indicated in the specific areas of anxiety, physical and psychological distress, depression, and loneliness—than did parents of children with diabetes. Distress levels of parents of patients with cancer matched those in parents of patients with diabetes in measures of uncertainty, loss of control, self-esteem, disease-related fear, and sleep disturbances. Distress levels for parents of children with cancer decreased in intensity with longer time since diagnosis.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_33">At the same time that they are dealing with increased distress, parents of children with cancer report wanting to remain strong and optimistic for their children.<Reference refidx="7"/> One study found no differences in multiple measures of family distress and psychological functioning between families of children with cancer and families with healthy children.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_100">Several factors appear to be predictive of long-term parental adjustment.

Thirty-eight percent of the parents indicated that their children continued to receive cancer-directed therapy, even after the parents recognized that there was no realistic chance of success. Sixty-one percent of these reported that their child experienced some suffering, and 57% reported little or no benefit from the continued treatment. Despite these experiences, 57% reported that they would recommend standard chemotherapy during the end-of-life phase, and 33% would recommend experimental (phase I and phase II) treatment.

However, even those who did not personally support using standard chemotherapy at the end of life (91%) felt that physicians should offer this as an option.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_72">Parent and physician perspectives on quality of care at the end of life do not always match.

Medications and other supportive care interventions should be provided for pain, agitation, pruritus, nausea and vomiting, seizures, and secretions. For children for whom bleeding is a disturbing end-of-life consequence, platelet transfusions may also be appropriate.</ListItem><ListItem>The emotional and spiritual needs of families and children should be identified and addressed. Families are composed of individuals, and there are usually variations in how individual family members cope with impending death; cultural beliefs and practices may also influence this process. Being aware of factors that contribute to this variation and tailoring interventions to individual families are important aspects of end-of-life care.</ListItem><ListItem>Structured support for bereavement care should be provided. Some institutions support bereavement teams who provide families with items such as handprints of the child, photo albums, and quilts to facilitate transition at the time of the child’s death. Other institutions provide parents with information about what may occur at the time of death and common experiences of family members in the hours, days, weeks, and months following the death. Some also provide one to three sessions of bereavement support for family members after the child’s death. (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062821" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/caregivers/planning/bereavement-hp-pdq">Grief, Bereavement, and Coping With Loss</SummaryRef> for more information.)</ListItem><ListItem>Parents should be engaged in early discussion about advance care planning. It has been suggested that this discussion begin at the time of diagnosis for all children who have a survival prognosis lower than 50%, although others prefer to delay this discussion until the time of relapse or disease progression. Advanced care planning includes discussion about the use of standard or experimental treatments, preferred location for the child’s death, whether to involve hospice, funeral arrangements, and whether a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order is to be implemented in inpatient and outpatient settings. Depending on their developmental and cognitive capacities, some children who are dying benefit from being included in these advance care decisions.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_81"><Title>Other Issues</Title><Para id="_82">Many aspects of end-of-life care for adults and children with cancer overlap. At the same time, specific developmental, family, and even legal issues are unique to children and require careful consideration. State laws related to withdrawal or withholding of care vary, and end-of-life care may be affected by whether a child is in the custody of biologic parents or legal guardians or is a ward of the state. Some states do not permit DNR decisions to be made for children in their care. Health care teams have a responsibility to be aware of state laws, hospital policies, and ethical standards in their community and integrate this information into end-of-life care. Ultimately, the challenge is to balance available intervention and support with unique family, child, and physician concerns in a way that optimizes quality of life for the child and family.<Reference refidx="15"/> (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000543592" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/caregivers/planning/last-days-hp-pdq">Last Days of Life</SummaryRef> for more information.)</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="18837040">Linabery AM, Ross JA: Childhood and adolescent cancer survival in the US by race and ethnicity for the diagnostic period 1975-1999.
