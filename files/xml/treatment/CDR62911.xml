</Para><Para id="_6">In localized distal gastric cancer, more than 50% of patients can be cured. 
However, early-stage disease accounts for only 10% to 20% of all cases
diagnosed in the United States.  The remaining patients present with metastatic
disease in either regional or distant sites.  The overall survival rate in
these patients at 5 years ranges from almost no survival for patients with
disseminated disease to almost 50% survival for patients with localized distal
gastric cancers confined to resectable regional disease.  Even with apparent
localized disease, the 5-year survival rate of patients with proximal gastric
cancer is only 10% to 15%.  Although the treatment of patients with
disseminated gastric cancer may result in palliation of symptoms and some
prolongation of survival, long remissions are uncommon.
