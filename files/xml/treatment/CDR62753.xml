the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States.<Reference refidx="2"/>     It is
estimated that there will be 132,700 new cases diagnosed in the United States in   2015 and    49,700 deaths due to this disease.  From 2007 to 2011, CRC incidence declined by 4.3% per year  among adults aged 50 years  and
older. However, in adults younger than 50 years, CRC incidence rates have been increasing by 1.8% per year. From 2007 to 2011, mortality from CRC
declined by  2.5% per year.<Reference refidx="2"/>  The
incidence is higher in men than in women.  It ranges from   45.9 per 100,000 per
year in Hispanic men to 62.3 per 100,000 per year in African American men.  In women, it ranges from
  31.4 per 100,000 per year in Hispanics to 47.5  per 100,000 per year in African Americans.

 The 
age-adjusted mortality rates is  19.1  per 100,000 per year in men and  13.5  per 100,000 per year in
women.<Reference refidx="3"/>  About 5% of Americans are expected to develop the disease within
their lifetime and about half of those will die from it.<Reference refidx="3"/> Age-specific incidence and mortality rates show that  the vast majority of
cases are diagnosed after age 50 years; about 4% of CRCs occur younger than age 50 years.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>
</Para><Para id="_15">Among the groups that have a high incidence of CRC are those with hereditary conditions, such as familial adenomatous
polyposis and hereditary nonpolyposis CRC (inherited in an
autosomal dominant manner).  Combined, the two groups account for no more than 6% of
CRCs.  More common conditions associated with an increased risk
include a personal history of CRC or adenomas; first-degree
relative with CRC; a personal history of ovarian, endometrial, or
breast cancer; and a personal history of long-standing chronic ulcerative
colitis or Crohn colitis.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/>  These high-risk groups account for about a
quarter of all CRCs.  Limiting screening or early cancer
detection to only these high-risk groups would miss the majority of CRCs.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_16">Genetic,<Reference refidx="10"/> experimental, and epidemiologic <Reference refidx="11"/> studies suggest that
CRC results from complex interactions between inherited
susceptibility and environmental or lifestyle factors.  Efforts to identify
causes   led to the hypothesis
that adenomatous polyps (adenomas) are precursors for the vast majority of
CRCs.<Reference refidx="12"/>  In effect, measures that reduce the incidence and
prevalence of adenomas may result in a subsequent decrease in the risk of
CRCs;<Reference refidx="13"/> however, some CRC mortality may be caused by fast-growing lesions and even lesions that do not pass through an adenomatous phase. Overall, the details of growth rates of adenomas and cancer are unknown; most likely there is a broad spectrum of growth patterns, including formation and spontaneous regression of adenomas.<Reference refidx="14"/></Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="2203551" MedlineID="90367246">Shike M, Winawer SJ, Greenwald PH, et al.: Primary prevention of colorectal cancer.

Collection details vary somewhat for different tests, but typically involve collection of as many as three different specimens on 3 different days, with small amounts from one specimen smeared by a wooden stick on a card with two windows or otherwise placed in a specimen container.</Para><Para id="_234">The guaiac test identifies peroxidase-like activity that is characteristic of human and nonhuman hemoglobin.

progress to evaluate the efficacy of screening utilizing the  FOBT.  The Swedish trial is a targeted study for individuals aged 60 to 64 years.<Reference refidx="1"/>  The English trial selects candidates from lists of family
practitioners.<Reference refidx="2"/>  The Danish trial offers screening to a population aged 45
to 75 years who were randomly assigned to a control or study group.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> 
</Para><Para id="_20">The Minnesota trial randomly assigned 46,551 men and women aged 50 to 80 years  to one of three arms:  colorectal cancer screening with guaiac-based, rehydrated FOBT every year (15,570), every 2 years (15,587), or control (15,394). This trial demonstrated that annual FOBT screening decreased mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) by 33% after 18 years of follow-up (relative risk [RR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51–0.83, compared with the control group) and
that biennial testing resulted in a 21% relative mortality reduction (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62–0.97).<Reference refidx="5"/>   Some part of the reduction may have been attributed to chance
detection of cancer by colonoscopies; rehydration of guaiac test slides greatly
increased positivity and consequently increased the number of colonoscopies performed.<Reference refidx="6"/> 
Subsequent analyses by the Minnesota investigators using mathematical modeling
suggested that for 75% to 84% of the patients, mortality reduction was achieved
because of sensitive detection of CRCs by the test; chance
detection played a  modest role (16%–25% of the reduction).<Reference refidx="7"/>  Nearly 85% of
patients with a positive test underwent diagnostic procedures that included
colonoscopy or double-contrast barium enema plus flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS).   After
18 years of follow-up, the incidence of CRC was reduced by 20% in
the annually screened arm and 17% in the biennially screened arm. With follow-up through 30 years, there was a sustained reduction in CRC mortality of 32% in the annually screened arm (RR,  0.68; 95% CI, 0.56–0.82) and 22% in the biennially screened arm (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.93).  There was no reduction in all-cause mortality in either screened arm (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99–1.01 for the annually screened arm; and RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98–1.01 for the biennially screened arm).<Reference refidx="8"/>   Important information that was not reported includes the treatment of CRC cases by stage by arm and the extent of CRC screening in each arm by  FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy after the completion of the trial protocol.<Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_21">The English trial allocated approximately 76,000 individuals to each arm. 
Those in the screened arm were offered nonrehydrated guaiac FOBT (gFOBT)   testing every 2 years
for three to six rounds from 1985 to 1995.  At a median follow-up time of 7.8 years, 60% completed at least one test,    and 38% completed all tests.  Cumulative
incidence of CRC was similar in both arms, and the trial reported a RR  reduction of 15% in CRC mortality (odds ratio
[OR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74–0.98).<Reference refidx="10"/>   The
serious complication rate of colonoscopy was 0.5%.  There were five deaths within
30 days of surgery for screen-detected CRC or adenoma in a
total of 75,253 individuals screened.<Reference refidx="11"/>
After a median follow-up of 11.8 years,  no difference in CRC incidence between the intervention and control groups was  observed.  The disease-specific mortality rate ratio associated with screening was 0.87 (0.78–0.97; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .01). The rate ratio for death from all causes was 1.00 (0.98–1.02; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .79).<Reference refidx="12"/> When the median follow-up was extended to 19.5 years, there was a 9% reduction in CRC mortality (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84–0.98) but no reduction in CRC incidence (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.91–1.03), or death from all causes (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.99–1.02).<Reference refidx="13"/></Para><Para id="_22">The Danish trial in Funen, Denmark, entered approximately 31,000 individuals
into two arms, in which individuals in the screened arm were offered
nonrehydrated gFOBT testing every 2 years for nine rounds over a 17-year period. 
Sixty-seven percent completed the first screen, and more than 90% of individuals
invited to each subsequent screen underwent FOBT testing.  This trial
demonstrated an 18% reduction in CRC mortality at 10 years of
follow-up,<Reference refidx="14"/>  15% at 13 years of follow-up (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 
0.73–1.00),<Reference refidx="15"/> and 11% at 17 years of follow-up (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78–1.01).<Reference refidx="16"/> CRC incidence and overall mortality were
virtually identical in both arms.</Para><Para id="_163">The Swedish trial in Goteborg enrolled all 68,308 citizens in the city born between 1918 and 1931 who were aged 60 to 64 years and randomly assigned them to screening and control groups of nearly equal size.  Participants in the control group were not contacted and were unaware they were part of the trial.  Screening was offered at different frequencies to three different cohorts according to year of birth.  Screening was done using the gFOBT Hemoccult-II test after dietary restriction.  Nearly 92% of tests were rehydrated.  Individuals with a positive test result were invited to an examination consisting of a case history, FS, and  double-contrast barium enema.  The range of follow-up times was from 6 years 7 months to 19 years 5 months, depending on the date of enrollment. The primary endpoint was CRC-specific mortality. The overall screening compliance rate was 70%, and 47.2% of participants completed all screenings.  Of the 2,180 participants with a positive test, 1,890 (86.7%) underwent a complete diagnostic evaluation with 104 cancers and 305 adenomas of at least 10 mm detected.  In total, there were 721 CRCs (152 Dukes D, 184 Dukes C) in the screening group and 754 CRCs (161 Dukes D, 221 Dukes C) in the control group, with an incidence ratio of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.86–1.06). Deaths from CRC  were 252 in the screening group and 300 in the control group, with a mortality ratio of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.71–0.99).  This CRC mortality difference emerged after 9 years of follow-up.  Deaths from all causes were very similar in the two groups, with a mortality ratio of 1.02 (95% CI, 0.99–1.06).<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_23">All trials have shown a more favorable stage distribution in the screened
population compared with controls (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062753#_55" url="/types/colorectal/hp/colorectal-screening-pdq">Table 3</SummaryRef>).  Data from the Danish
trial indicate that while the cumulative incidence of CRC was
similar in the screened and control groups, a higher percentage of CRCs and adenomas were Dukes A and B lesions in the screened group.<Reference refidx="14"/> 
A meta-analysis of all previously reported randomized trials using biennial FOBT showed no overall mortality reduction by gFOBT screening (RR, 1.002; 95% CI, 0.989–1.085). The RR of CRC death in the gFOBT arm was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.8–0.95),  and the RR of non-CRC death in the gFOBT group was 1.02 (95% CI, 1.00–1.04; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .015).<Reference refidx="17"/></Para><Para id="_25">Mathematical models have been constructed to extrapolate the results of

</Para><Para id="_126">A systematic review done through the Cochrane Collaboration examined all CRC screening randomized trials that involved gFOBT testing on more than one occasion.   The combined results showed that trial participants allocated to screening had a 16% lower CRC   mortality (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78–0.90).  There was, however, no difference in all-cause mortality between the screened and control groups (RR, 1.00;   95% CI, 0.99–1.02).  Furthermore, the trials reported a low positive predictive value (PPV)  for the FOBT test, suggesting that most positive tests were false positives.   From the trials with nonrehydrated slides (Funen and Nottingham), the PPV was 5.0% to 18.7%, while the PPV in the trials using rehydrated slides (Goteborg and Minnesota) was 0.9% to 6.1%.

The advantage of iFOBT over gFOBT is that it does not detect hemoglobin from nonhuman dietary sources.  It also does not detect partly digested human hemoglobin that comes from the upper respiratory or GI tract.  Preliminary studies of several commercially developed iFOBT tests define their sensitivity and specificity compared with concurrently performed colonoscopy.  These studies also examine these outcomes for different cut points, and the benefit of multiple versus single stool samples.<Reference refidx="30"/>  Generally,  iFOBT testing is more sensitive for cancers than for benign neoplasias.  As expected, higher cut points decrease sensitivity and increase specificity.</Para><Para id="_130"> In one study, 2,188 patients scheduled for colonoscopy because of an elevated risk due to personal or family history of colorectal neoplasm, positive gFOBT result, change in bowel habits, anemia, abdominal pain with weight loss, or anal symptoms were invited to participate in a comparative assessment of iFOBT against colonoscopy findings.  After exclusions for health and cognitive reasons, 1,859 patients were offered iFOBT, 1,116 patients adhered to the protocol, and 1,000 patients completed the procedure.  Sensitivity and specificity were calculated at various cut-points.  At a cut-point of 100 ng/mL, sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 88.2% and 89.7% for cancer and 61.5% and 91.4% for any clinically significant neoplasia (cancer and advanced polyps).  At 150 ng/mL the respective sensitivities and specificities were 82.4% and 91.9% for cancer and 53.8% and 95% for any clinically significant neoplasia.  Calculations were based on the most severe pathologic finding from colonoscopy and the highest fecal-hemoglobin concentration measured by iFOBT applied to three stool samples collected prior to the colonoscopy.  Stool samples were collected by patients following iFOBT kit instructions and analyzed by the OC-MICRO analyzer (from the Eiken Chemical Company in Tokyo, Japan).<Reference refidx="31"/></Para><Para id="_204">In another study, 21,805 asymptomatic patients received iFOBT based on one stool sample collected by patients following the kit instructions on the day of or the day before the colonoscopy. Stool samples were analyzed using the Magstream 1,000/Hem SP automated system (from Fujirebio Incorporated, Tokyo, Japan), which is based on the HemeSelect system (from Beckman Coulter, Palo Alto, California). Sensitivity and specificity based on subsequent colonoscopy were, respectively, 65.8% and 94.6% for cancer and 27.1% and 95.1% for advanced neoplasm.<Reference refidx="32"/></Para><Para id="_212">Fecal immunochemical tests may vary with regard to numbers of stools tested and cut-off values for a positive result.<Reference refidx="30"/><Reference refidx="33"/><Reference refidx="34"/></Para><Para id="_205">A systematic review to evaluate the comparative diagnostic performance of gFOBT and iFOBT in the context of a decision to introduce screening for CRC in the United Kingdom, included 33 studies evaluating gFOBT and 35 studies evaluating iFOBT, including nine that evaluated both gFOBT and iFOBT.  There was no clear evidence for superiority of either gFOBT or iFOBT.  Sensitivities for the detection of all neoplasms ranged from 6.2% (specificity 98%) to 83.3% (specificity 98.4%) for gFOBTs and 5.4% (specificity 98.5%) to 62.6% (specificity 94.3%) for iFOBT.  Increasing sensitivity entailed adjusting cut-points to decrease specificity.  Sensitivities were higher for the detection of CRC and lower for adenomas.<Reference refidx="35"/></Para><Para id="_192">Some studies have utilized the quantitative ability of iFOBT to consider detection and specificity at various test cut-points for defining a positive test.  One study <Reference refidx="36"/> found that reducing the cut-point from the standard 100 ng/mL to 50 ng/mL increased the detection of advanced adenomas but had little impact on the detection of cancer.  The number of colonoscopies required to detect a single advanced adenoma or cancer increased from 1.9 to 2.3; a 20% increase.  Specificity declined from 97.8% to 96%.</Para><Para id="_206">Potential false-positive test results due to an increased risk of upper GI bleeding are of concern with FOBT testing and pretest protocols, therefore; low-dose aspirin regimens should be discontinued for a week or more prior to FOBT.  The performance of iFOBT was tested in an ongoing diagnostic study (2005–2009) at 20 internal medicine GI practices in southern Germany.  Nineteen hundred seventy-nine patients (233 regular low-dose aspirin users and 1,746 never users) were identified in the records for inclusion in the analysis.  All patients provided one stool sample taken within a week before colonoscopy preparation, which was collected according to instructions in a container that was kept refrigerated or frozen until rendered to the clinic on the day of colonoscopy, and the patients agreed to complete a standard questionnaire regarding the use of analgesics and low-dose aspirin (for prevention of cardiovascular disease).  Stool samples were thawed within a median of 4 days after arrival at the central laboratory (shipped frozen from the recipient clinics).  Fecal occult blood levels were measured by two automated iFOBT tests according to the manufacturer’s instructions (RIDASCREEN Haemoglobin and RIDASCREEN Haemo-/Haptoglobin Complex, r-biopharm, Bensheim, Germany) following clinical procedures and blinded to colonoscopy results.  Advanced neoplasms were found in 24 aspirin users (10.3%) and in 181 nonusers (10.4%).  At the cut-point recommended by the manufacturer, sensitivities for the two tests were 70.8% (95% CI, 48.9%–87.4%) for users compared with 35.9% (95% CI, 28.9%–43.4%) for nonusers and 58.3% (95% CI, 36.6%–77.9%) for users compared with 32% (95% CI, 25.3%–39.4%) for nonusers (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .001 and <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .01, respectively).  Specificities were 85.7% (95% CI, 80.2–90.1%) for users compared with 89.2% (95% CI, 87.6%–90.7%) for nonusers and 85.7% (95% CI, 80.2%–90.1%) for users compared with 91.1% (95% CI, 89.5%–92.4%) for nonusers (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .13 and <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .01, respectively).  For these iFOBTs, sensitivity for advanced neoplasms was notably higher with the use of low-dose aspirin while specificity was only slightly reduced, suggesting that there might be an advantage to aspirin use to increase sensitivity without much decrease in specificity.<Reference refidx="37"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_32"><Title>Sigmoidoscopy</Title><Para id="_33">The flexible fiberoptic sigmoidoscope was introduced in 1969.

acceptable patient tolerance than the older rigid sigmoidoscope.  The rigid instrument can discover 25% of polyps, and the 60 cm

These are the Norwegian Colorectal Cancer Prevention (NORCCAP) trial; the Telemark trial in Norway; the United Kingdom trial; the SCORE trial in Italy; and the U.S. Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.  Participants were aged 50 to 59 years in the Telemark trial, aged 55 to 74 years in PLCO, and aged 55 to 64 years in the other three trials.  Together the trials enrolled 166,000 participants in the screened groups and 250,000 participants in the control groups.  Follow-up ranged from 6 to 13 years.  Results were summarized in two systematic reviews.  There was an overall 28% relative reduction in CRC mortality (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.65–0.80), an 18% relative reduction in CRC incidence (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73–0.91), and a 33% relative reduction in the incidence of left-sided CRC (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.59–0.76).

Sigmoidoscopy detects lesions in the left colon directly but detects lesions in the right colon only indirectly when a positive sigmoidoscopy (that may variously be defined as a finding of advanced adenoma, any adenoma, or any polyp) is used to trigger a colonoscopic examination of the whole colon.</Para><Para id="_41">In 2,885 veterans (97% male; mean age 63 years), the prevalence of advanced
adenoma at colonoscopy was 10.6%.  It was estimated that combined screening
with one-time FOBT and sigmoidoscopy would detect 75.8% 
(95% CI, 71.0%–80.6%) of advanced neoplasms.  Examination of the rectum and
sigmoid colon during colonoscopy was defined as a surrogate for sigmoidoscopy. 
This represented a small but statistically insignificant increase in the rate of
detection of advanced neoplasia when compared with  FS alone
(70.3%; 95% CI, 65.2%–75.4%).  The latter result could be achieved assuming that
all patients with an adenoma in the distal colon undergo complete colonoscopy. 
Advanced neoplasia was defined as a lesion measuring at least 10 mm in
diameter, containing 25% or more villous histology, high-grade dysplasia, or
invasive cancer.<Reference refidx="47"/>  One-time use of FOBT differs from

FIT plus the finding of  advanced neoplasia in the rectosigmoid colon yielded a sensitivity of 62.5% and a specificity of 93%. Thus, in this trial, the addition of sigmoidoscopy to FIT did not substantially improve the detection of right-sided colon cancers, compared with FIT alone.<Reference refidx="48"/></Para><Para id="_66">The NORCCAP once-only screening study randomly assigned 20,780 men and women, aged 50 to 64 years, to FS only or a combination of FS and FOBT with FlexSure OBT.<Reference refidx="49"/>  A positive FS was defined as a finding of any neoplasia  or any polyp at least 10 mm.

Adenomas were found in 2,208  participants (17%), and 545 (4.2%) had high-risk adenomas.

largest adenomas detected were no larger than 5 mm, 53% for those in which the
largest adenomas detected were 6 mm to 10 mm, and 48% for those in which the
largest adenomas detected were larger than 10 mm.  In patients who have undergone
colonoscopic polypectomy, colonoscopic examination is a more sensitive method
of surveillance than double-contrast barium enema.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_44"><Title>Colonoscopy</Title><Para id="_173">Because there are no completed RCTs of colonoscopy, evidence of benefit is indirect.  Most indirect evidence is about   detection rate of lesions that may be clinically important (like early CRC or  advanced adenomas).  Some case-control results are available.  One RCT of colonoscopy has  been initiated.<Reference refidx="51"/></Para><SummarySection id="_174"><Title>Evidence about lesion detection rate</Title><Para id="_175">In a colonoscopic study of 3,121 predominantly male U.S. veterans (mean age: 63
years), advanced neoplasia (defined as an adenoma that was ≥10.0 mm in
diameter, a villous adenoma, an adenoma with high-grade dysplasia, or invasive
cancer) was identified in 10.5% of the individuals.<Reference refidx="52"/>  Among patients with no
adenomas distal to the splenic flexure, 2.7% had advanced proximal neoplasia. 
Patients with large adenomas (≥10.0 mm) or small adenomas (&lt;10.0 mm) in the
distal colon were more likely to have advanced proximal neoplasia than were
patients with no distal adenomas (OR, 3.4; 90% CI, 1.8–6.5 and OR, 2.6; 90% CI,
1.7–4.1,  respectively).  One-half of those with advanced proximal neoplasia, however, had no
distal adenomas.  In a study of 1,994 adults (aged 50 years or older) who
underwent colonoscopic screening as part of a program sponsored by an employer,
5.6% had advanced neoplasms.<Reference refidx="53"/>  Forty-six percent of those with advanced
proximal neoplasms had no distal polyps (hyperplastic or adenomatous).  If
colonoscopic screening is performed only in patients with distal polyps, about
half the cases of advanced proximal neoplasia will not be detected.</Para><Para id="_176">A study of colonoscopy in women compared the yield of sigmoidoscopy versus colonoscopy.  Among 1,463 women, cancer was found in one woman and advanced colonic neoplasia in 72 women or 4.9% (about one-half the prevalence compared with men).      The authors focused, however, on RR (i.e., RR of missing an advanced neoplasm) as the outcome, instead of absolute risk of such neoplasms, which is substantially lower in women.  In addition, the natural history of advanced neoplasia is not known, so its importance as an outcome in studies of detection is not clear.<Reference refidx="54"/></Para><Para id="_177">Analysis of data from a colonoscopy-based screening program in Warsaw, Poland demonstrated higher rates of advanced neoplasia in men than in women.  The predominant age range of participants was 50 to 66 years. Of the 43,042 participants aged 50 to 66 years, advanced neoplasia was detected in 5.9% (5.7% among women with a family history of CRC, 4.3% among women without a family history of CRC, 12.2% among men with a family history of CRC, and 8.0% among men without a family history of CRC).     Clinically significant complications requiring medical intervention were rare (0.1%) consisting of five perforations, 13 episodes of bleeding, 22 cardiovascular events, and 11 other events over the entire population of 50,148 screened persons.  There were no deaths; however, the author reported that collection of 30-day complications data was not systematic; therefore, the data may not be reliable.<Reference refidx="55"/></Para><Para id="_228">Flat or difficult-to-detect lesions include "serrated polyps," which may be more common in the right colon than they are in  the left. The term serrated polyp is currently used to include hyperplastic polyps, sessile serrated adenomas, traditional serrated adenomas, and mixed serrated polyps.<Reference refidx="56"/><Reference refidx="57"/> The clinical significance of these lesions is uncertain, because the natural history is so difficult to learn for any polypoid lesion.  However, the histologic and molecular characteristics of some serrated lesions suggest possibly important malignant potential (mutations in the <GeneName>BRAF</GeneName> gene may be an early step toward carcinogenesis in serrated polyps).<Reference refidx="57"/> This potential, along with the challenges of detecting flat lesions, may partially account for recent reports of a colonoscopy's lesser protective effect in the right colon compared to the left.</Para><Para id="_231">In 2011, authors of one study reported variability of detection rates for proximal serrated polyps. They studied 15 colonoscopists on faculty at one university and showed, during the years 2000 to 2009, a wide variation in detection rate for proximal serrated polyps, ranging (per colonoscopy) from 0.01 to 0.26, suggesting that many proximal serrated lesions may be missed on routine exam.<Reference refidx="56"/> The overall proportion of polyps that are "serrated" is unknown, in part because these lesions have been unappreciated and/or difficult to identify.</Para><Para id="_261">Detection rates in colonoscopy screening vary with the rate at which the endoscopist examines the colon while withdrawing the scope.                                                  In one study, there were differences among gastroenterologists  in the rates of detection of adenomas (range of the mean number of lesions per patient screened, 0.10–1.05; range of the percentage of patients with adenomas, 9.4%–23.7%) and the times of withdrawal of the scope (3.1–16.8 minutes for procedures not including polyp removal).  Examiners whose mean withdrawal time was 6 minutes or more had higher detection rates than those with mean withdrawal times of less than 6 minutes (28.3% vs. 11.8%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001 for any neoplasia and 6.4% vs. 2.6%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt;    .005 for advanced neoplasia).<Reference refidx="58"/>  Overall detection rate of adenomas and cancer may be affected by how thoroughly endoscopists search for flat adenomas and flat cancer.                                      While the phenomenon of   flat neoplasms  has been appreciated for years in Japan, it has more recently been described in the United States.  In a study in which endoscopists used high-resolution white-light endoscopes, flat or nonpolypoid lesions were found to account for only 11% of all superficial colon lesions, but they were about 9.8 times as likely to contain cancer (<Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> neoplasia or invasive cancer) compared with polypoid  lesions.<Reference refidx="42"/>           However, because the definition of flat or  nonpolypoid was height less than one-half                           of the diameter,    it is likely that many lesions classified as  nonpolypoid   in this study would be routinely found and described by U.S. endoscopists as sessile.     At the same time, the existence of very flat or depressed lesions (depressed lesions are very uncommon but are highly likely to contain cancer) means that endoscopists will want to pay increasing attention to this problem.<Reference refidx="59"/>   Flat lesions may play a role in the phenomenon of missed cancers.<Reference refidx="60"/></Para><Para id="_262">The impact of adenoma detection rates (ADRs) was assessed in a health maintenance organization in follow-up after 314,872 colonoscopies done from 1998 to 2010 by 136 gastroenterologists, each of whom had done at least 300 colonoscopies during that period.  The goal was to determine rates of interval CRC, interval advanced CRC, and CRC death and to relate those rates to a gastroenterologist’s ADR.   There were 712 interval cancers (155 advanced) and 147 CRC deaths.  The risk of interval cancer from lowest to highest quintile of ADR was 9.8, 8.6, 8.0, 7.0, and 4.8 per 10,000 person-years of follow-up.   The adjusted hazard ratio, for physicians in the highest quintile compared with the lowest, was 0.52 for any interval CRC, 0.43 for advanced CRC, and 0.38 for fatal CRC.  Each 1.0% increase in ADR was associated with a 3% decrease in risk of cancer, although the CI for each quintile was broad.  Limitations of the study include the inability to determine which specific feature of ADR led to reduced interval cancer; for example, it is unclear whether it was due to the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_263" Style="bullet">

Based on case-control data about sigmoidoscopy, noted above, it has been speculated in the past that protection for the right colon might be similar to that found for the left colon.  However, a recent case-control study of colonoscopy raises questions about whether the impact of colonoscopy on right-sided lesions might be different than the impact on left-sided lesions.<Reference refidx="62"/> Using a province-wide administrative data base in Ontario, investigators compared cases of persons who had received a diagnosis of CRC from 1996 to 2001 and had died by 2003.  Controls were selected from persons who did not die of CRC.  Billing claims were used to assess exposure to previous colonoscopy.  The OR for the association between complete colonoscopy and left-sided lesions was 0.33, suggesting a substantial mortality reduction.  For right-sided lesions, however, the OR of 0.99 indicated virtually no mortality reduction.</Para><Para id="_181">This difference, which was striking and unexpected, might be explained in several possible ways and has been discussed extensively.<Reference refidx="63"/> It is possible that exams were incomplete and did not reach the cecum even though they were coded as complete.      It is possible that poor prep or incomplete mucosal inspection caused important lesions to be missed.  It is also possible that examination was complete but some right-sided lesions simply grow rapidly and are not detected and treated by periodic colonoscopy.  In other words, it is impossible to determine the reason for the dramatically different results on the right side compared to the left side, which are either the result of  physician-related and patient-related factors or are the result of  the biology of cancer.</Para><Para id="_182">Even if it is not possible to determine which reasons may be responsible for the right side  versus the left side difference, the findings beg the  question,   “What is the degree of mortality reduction from colonoscopy?”        While a figure of 90% is sometimes cited as the degree of mortality reduction,<Reference refidx="64"/> the question will not be properly answered until the  European study is completed.<Reference refidx="51"/>  In the meantime, the results of  the study mentioned above <Reference refidx="62"/> question what is known about the degree of CRC mortality reduction provided by colonoscopy.

There are several concerns from this study,      including the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_185" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Most, but not all, lesions found by CTC and not by OC were followed up with repeat OC.</ListItem><ListItem>The design itself did not allow for following patients, thus potentially missing lesions that grow rapidly and would only be seen after follow-up.</ListItem><ListItem>Because the centers conducting the screening were primarily academic centers and the radiologists and endoscopists were carefully trained, the generalizability of the findings is not clear.</ListItem><ListItem>Sixteen percent of people had an extracolonic finding that required further evaluation.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_186">Unknowns from the study include the following for either OC or CTC:  the number of detected polyps that would have progressed to invasive cancer, and the number of people harmed by the screening process.<Reference refidx="67"/></Para><Para id="_189">Another study reported similar sensitivity and specificity in persons with an increased risk of CRC.<Reference refidx="68"/>  In this study, the sensitivity of OC could not be determined because it was done in an unblinded manner.  This study suggests that virtual colonoscopy might be an acceptable screening or surveillance test for persons with a high risk of CRC, but this cross-sectional study does not address outcome or frequency of testing in high-risk persons.</Para><Para id="_97">Some studies have assessed how well virtual colonoscopy can detect colorectal polyps without a laxative prep.  The question is of great importance for implementation because the laxative prep required by both conventional colonoscopy and virtual colonoscopy is considered a great disadvantage by patients.  By tagging feces with iodinated contrast material ingested during several days prior to the procedure, investigators in one study  were able to detect lesions larger than 8 mm with 95% sensitivity and 92% specificity.<Reference refidx="69"/>   The particular tagging material used in this study caused about 10% of patients to become nauseated; however, other materials are being assessed.  </Para><Para id="_238">Another study <Reference refidx="70"/> utilized low fiber diet, orally ingested contrast, and "electronic cleansing," a process that subtracts tagged feces. CTC identified 91% of persons with adenomas 10 mm or larger, but detected fewer (70%) lesions greater than or equal to 8 mm. Patients who received both CTC and OC preferred CTC to OC (290 vs. 175). This study shows that CTC without a laxative prep detects small 1 cm lesions with high sensitivity and is acceptable to patients. Long-term utilization of CTC will depend on several issues including the frequency of follow-up exams that would be needed to detect smaller lesions that were undetected and may grow over time.</Para><Para id="_77">Extracolonic abnormalities are common in CTC. Fifteen percent of patients in an Australian series of 100 patients, referred for colonography because of symptoms or family history, were found to have extracolonic findings, and 11% of the patients needed further medical workups for renal, splenic, uterine, liver, and gallbladder abnormalities.<Reference refidx="71"/> In another study, 59%  of 111 symptomatic patients referred for clinical colonoscopy in a Swedish hospital between June 1998 and September 1999 were found to have moderate or major extracolonic conditions on CTC. CTC was  performed immediately prior to colonoscopy  and these findings required further evaluation. It is unstated to what extent the follow-up of these incidental findings benefited patients.<Reference refidx="72"/>    </Para><Para id="_82">Sixty-nine percent of  681 asymptomatic patients in Minnesota had extracolonic findings, of which 10% were considered to be highly important by the investigators, requiring further medical workup.  Suspected abnormalities involved kidney (34), chest (22), liver (8), ovary (6), renal or splenic arteries (4), retroperitoneum (3), and pancreas (1);<Reference refidx="73"/>  however, the extent to which these findings will contribute to benefits or harms is uncertain.  Two other studies, one large (n = 2,195) and one small (n = 136) examined the moderate or high importance of extracolonic findings from CTC. The larger study <Reference refidx="74"/> found that 8.6% of patients had an extracolonic finding of at least moderate importance, while 24% of patients in the smaller study <Reference refidx="75"/> required some evaluation for an extracolonic finding.  The larger study found nine cancers from these evaluations, at a partial cost (they did not include all costs) of $98.56 per patient initially screened.  The smaller study found no important lesions from evaluation, at a cost of $248 per person screened.  Both of these estimates of cost are higher than previous studies have found.  The extent to which any patients benefited from the detection of extracolonic findings is not clear.  Because both of these studies were conducted in academic medical centers, the generalizability to other settings is also not clear.  Neither of these studies examined the effect of extracolonic findings on patient anxiety and psychological function.</Para><Para id="_78">Technical improvements involving both the interpretation methodology, such as three dimensional (3-D) imaging, and bowel preparation are under study in many centers.  While specificity for detection of polyps is homogeneously high in many studies, sensitivity can vary widely. These variations are attributable to a number of factors including characteristics of the CT scanner and detector, width of collimation, mode of imaging (two dimensional [2-D] vs. 3-D and/or "fly-through"), and variability in expertise of radiologists.<Reference refidx="76"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_30"><Title>Digital Rectal Examination</Title><Para id="_31">A case-control study reported that routine digital rectal examination was not

colorectal adenomas and carcinoma have been well characterized.<Reference refidx="78"/>  Advanced
techniques have been developed to detect several of these gene mutations that
have been shed into the stool.<Reference refidx="79"/><Reference refidx="80"/><Reference refidx="81"/><Reference refidx="82"/>  Stool DNA testing was recently assessed in a prospective study of asymptomatic persons who received colonoscopy, three-card FOBT (Hemoccult II), and stool DNA testing based on a panel of markers assessing 21 mutations. Conducted in a blinded way with prestated hypotheses and analyses, the study found that among 4,404 patients, the DNA panel had a sensitivity for CRC of 51.6% (for all stages of CRC) versus 12.9% for Hemoccult II, while the false-positive rates were 5.6% and 4.8%, respectively.  On this basis, the approach looks promising but would be improved, if possible, by increased sensitivity (perhaps by increasing the number of DNA markers) and by reduced cost.<Reference refidx="83"/><Reference refidx="84"/>
</Para><Para id="_265">A subsequent study of stool DNA markers utilized a new multitargeted stool test that combined methylation markers for <GeneName>NDRG4</GeneName> and <GeneName>BMP3</GeneName>, several <GeneName>KRAS</GeneName> mutations, and a human hemoglobin immunoassay.  The markers, each quantitated separately, were combined using an algorithm in a prespecified multivariable analysis.  The assay’s sensitivity and specificity were compared with a commercial FIT test (OC FIT-CHEK Polymedco), using colonoscopy as the gold standard.  Among 12,776 participants who had colonoscopy screening, were  enrolled from 2011 through 2012 at 90 sites in the United States and Canada, and were aged 50 to 84 years (and weighted toward &gt;65 years), 9,989 had fully evaluable results.  There were 65 CRC and 757 advanced adenomas or sessile serrated polyps 1 cm or greater.  The sensitivity for CRC was 92.3% (60 of 65 CRC) for the multitargeted test and 73.8% for FIT.  Sensitivity for advanced lesions was 42.4% for the multitargeted test and 23.8% for FIT.  Sensitivity for high-grade dysplasia was 69.2% for the multitarget test and 46.2% for FIT.  Sensitivity for serrated sessile polyps 1 cm or greater was 42.4% for the multitargeted test and 5.1% for FIT. Specificities were 86.6% for the multitargeted test and 94.9% for FIT, using nonadvanced or negative colonoscopy results, and were 89.8% and 96.4% for totally negative colonoscopy results.  A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that the multitargeted test has higher sensitivity than FIT alone, even if the FIT “cut-off” is reduced to try to increase sensitivity.  A limitation is that there were no data about performance of repeated testing over time and what may be an appropriate testing interval.<Reference refidx="85"/></Para><Para id="_266">Overall, the multitargeted test was more sensitive than FIT for both CRC and advanced precancerous lesions, but was less specific.<Reference refidx="85"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_259"><Title>Adherence to Screening</Title><Para id="_260">Benefit from CRC screening can only occur if eligible people are actually screened. There have been problems with screening adherence, particularly for low income and uninsured people. There has also been concern that some people may adhere less to screening with colonoscopy than with fecal tests. One well-conducted RCT found that, among an uninsured population, mailed FIT kit outreach and follow-up reminder phone calls resulted in an adherence rate of 40.7%. Mailed colonoscopy invitations and follow-up phone reminders resulted in a 24.6% adherence rate. The usual care adherence rate in this trial was 12.1%.<Reference refidx="86"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="18563785">Lindholm E, Brevinge H, Haglind E: Survival benefit in a randomized clinical trial of faecal occult blood screening for colorectal cancer.

The trials reported a low positive predictive value for the FOBT, suggesting that more than 80% of all positive tests were false-positives.<Reference refidx="1"/> A positive test can lead to further diagnostic procedures that include

Fifteen percent of patients in an Australian series of 100 patients, referred for colonography because of symptoms or family history, were found to have extracolonic findings, and 11% of the patients needed further medical workups for renal, splenic, uterine, liver, and gallbladder abnormalities.<Reference refidx="3"/> Other areas of extracolonic findings include the chest, ovary, and pancreas. In another study, 59%  of 111 symptomatic patients referred for clinical colonoscopy in a Swedish hospital between June 1998 and September 1999 were found to have moderate or major extracolonic conditions on CT colonography. CT colonography was  performed immediately prior to colonoscopy,    and these findings required further evaluation. It is unstated to what extent the follow-up of these incidental findings benefited patients.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_183">Sixty-nine percent of 681 asymptomatic patients in Minnesota had extracolonic findings, of which 10% were considered to be highly important by the investigators, requiring further medical workup.
