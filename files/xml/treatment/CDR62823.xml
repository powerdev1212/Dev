Risk factors include postmenopausal estrogen therapy, endometrial hyperplasia, obesity, reproductive factors like nulliparity, early menarche and late menopause, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and tamoxifen use. Women with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer     syndrome have a markedly increased risk of endometrial cancer compared with women in the general population. Women with a family history of endometrial cancer in a first-degree relative are also at increased risk.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_1"><Title>Overview</Title><Para id="_2">Note: Separate PDQ summaries on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062819" url="/types/uterine/hp/endometrial-screening-pdq">Endometrial Cancer Screening</SummaryRef>; <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062903" url="/types/uterine/hp/endometrial-treatment-pdq">Endometrial

The relative risk with cyclic estrogen-progestin therapy was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.91–1.22), compared with never-users.  A similar finding was observed in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort,<Reference refidx="50"/> with a decreased risk associated with continuous estrogen-progestin therapy, but this association was based on only three exposed cases.  In the EPIC study, sequential therapy was associated with an attenuated risk of endometrial cancer compared with estrogen-only therapy, but the observed risk was a borderline significant excess risk with sequential therapy (RR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.00–2.29) compared with never-users.<Reference refidx="50"/> These observed risks were similar to those observed in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study Cohort.<Reference refidx="51"/>  In that study, fewer than 10 days of estrogen-progestin therapy was associated with a borderline excess risk of endometrial cancer (RR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.00–2.13), but continuous therapy was associated with a statistically significant decreased risk of endometrial cancer (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49–0.83).</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_170"><Title>Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM): Tamoxifen and raloxifene</Title><Para id="_171">Tamoxifen and raloxifene are SERMs, drugs that have divergent estrogen agonist and antagonist effects in different target organs. The association between endometrial cancer and tamoxifen was first recognized in 1985, when three cases of endometrial cancer were described in women who had been treated with tamoxifen for breast cancer.<Reference refidx="52"/> Since then, confirmation of the association has been provided by randomized clinical trials using tamoxifen for breast cancer treatment and prevention <Reference refidx="53"/><Reference refidx="54"/><Reference refidx="55"/><Reference refidx="56"/> and  by case-control, observational, and laboratory studies.</Para><Para id="_172">The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, Breast Cancer Prevention Trial P-1 Study in women at high risk of invasive breast cancer demonstrated that tamoxifen decreased breast cancer incidence by 49%, but confirmed an increased incidence of endometrial cancer.  The annual rate was 2.3 per 1,000 for women receiving tamoxifen versus 0.91 for those on placebo.   Women older than 50 years experienced the largest effect. Of the 51 invasive cancers diagnosed in this trial, 50 were stage I.<Reference refidx="57"/></Para><Para id="_173">Raloxifene is a second-generation SERM approved for prophylaxis against postmenopausal osteoporosis. Unlike tamoxifen, it does not have an estrogenic effect on the uterus. The Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene  randomized trial, after 40 months of follow-up, showed that raloxifene reduced the risk of estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer, without increasing endometrial cancer (RR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.2–2.7).<Reference refidx="58"/> A population-based study of 547 women with endometrial cancer and 1,410 controls was done in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Of the cases, 18 (3.3%) had taken raloxifene and 34 (6.2%) had taken tamoxifen (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.3–6.9).<Reference refidx="59"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_174"><Title>Obesity</Title><Para id="_175">Elevated BMI and obesity are  associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer. One of the possible mechanisms for the observed association is an increased level of serum estrone in obese women as a result of aromatization of androstenedione in adipose tissue, which increases the production of estrogen.<Reference refidx="60"/> Alternatively, obesity has been associated with a reduction in levels of  SHBG, which may protect against endometrial cancer by decreasing bioavailable estrogen.<Reference refidx="61"/>          Obesity has been associated with several factors known to increase the risk of endometrial cancer, including upper-body or central adiposity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and physical inactivity.<Reference refidx="62"/></Para><Para id="_176">Presumably, body weight is a modifiable risk factor, which accounts for a substantial proportion of endometrial cases worldwide. A study conducted among European countries estimated that between 26% and 47% of endometrial cancer cases can be attributed to overweight and obesity. The same group conducted a meta-analysis of 12 studies (5 cohort and 7 case-control), which examined the relationship between obesity and endometrial cancer. Eleven of the 12 studies concluded that there is a positive association between endometrial cancer and excess weight.<Reference refidx="63"/></Para><Para id="_177">RRs associated with obesity range from 2 to 10.
