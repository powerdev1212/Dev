There are two types of radiation therapy.  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046686">External radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef> uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046345">Internal radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef> uses a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046550">radioactive</GlossaryTermRef> substance sealed in needles, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000257219">seeds</GlossaryTermRef>, wires, or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045637">catheters</GlossaryTermRef> that are placed directly into or near the cancer.  The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045885">stage</GlossaryTermRef> of the cancer being treated and whether a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045164">biopsy</GlossaryTermRef> was done before surgery to remove the tumor.</Para><Para id="_417">External radiation therapy is used to treat Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_76"><KeyPoint id="_77">Chemotherapy</KeyPoint><Para id="_78">Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000348921">drugs</GlossaryTermRef> to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/espanol/recursos/pdq">Spanish</ExternalRef>.</Para><Para id="_AboutThis_4">PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_AboutThis_5"><Title>Purpose of This Summary</Title><Para id="_AboutThis_6">This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the treatment of Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.  It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_AboutThis_7"><Title>Reviewers and Updates</Title><Para id="_AboutThis_8">Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary ("Date Last Modified") is the date of the most recent change.
</Para><Para id="_AboutThis_9">The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/pediatric-treatment-board">PDQ Pediatric Treatment Editorial Board</ExternalRef>.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_AboutThis_10"><Title>Clinical Trial Information</Title><Para id="_AboutThis_11">A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
</Para><Para id="_AboutThis_12">Clinical trials are listed in PDQ and can be found online at <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials">NCI's Web site</ExternalRef>. Many cancer doctors who take part in clinical trials are also listed in PDQ. For more information, call the Cancer Information Service 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).
