cancer, and 15,590 will die of this malignancy. Of the new cases,  it is estimated that 13,570
will occur in men and   3,410 will occur in women.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_9">Two histologic types account for the majority of malignant esophageal
neoplasms: adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma.  The epidemiology of
these types varies markedly.  In the 1960s, squamous cell cancers comprised
more than 90% of all esophageal tumors.  The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinomas
has risen considerably for the past 2 decades, such that it is now more
prevalent than squamous cell cancer in the United States and Western Europe,
with most tumors located in the distal esophagus.<Reference refidx="2"/>  Although the overall
incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is declining, this
histologic type remains six times more likely to occur in black males than in
white males.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Incidence rates generally increase with age in all
racial/ethnic groups but squamous cell cancer is consistently more common in
blacks than in whites.  Among black men, the incidence rate for those aged 55 to 69
 years is close to that of white men aged 70   years and older.  In
black women aged 55 to 69 years, the incidence rate is slightly higher than
 white women aged 70 years and older.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_10"><Title>Risk Factors</Title><Para id="_11">While risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus have been
identified (such as tobacco, alcoholism, malnutrition, and infection with human
papillomavirus),<Reference refidx="4"/> the risk factors associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma
are less defined.  The most important epidemiological difference between
squamous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma, however, is the strong association
between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and adenocarcinoma.  The results
of a population-based case-controlled study suggest that symptomatic
gastroesophageal reflux is a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma.  The
frequency, severity, and duration of reflux symptoms were positively associated
with increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/>
</Para><Para id="_12">Long-standing GERD predisposes to Barrett esophagus, the condition in which
an abnormal intestinal epithelium replaces the stratified squamous epithelium
that normally lines the distal esophagus.<Reference refidx="8"/>  The intestinal-type epithelium of
Barrett esophagus has a characteristic endoscopic appearance that differs
from squamous epithelium.<Reference refidx="9"/>  Dysplasia in Barrett epithelium represents an 
alteration of the columnar epithelium that may progress to invasive
adenocarcinoma.<Reference refidx="10"/>
</Para><Para id="_13">An interesting hypothesis relates the rise in incidence of esophageal
adenocarcinoma to a declining prevalence of <ScientificName>Helicobacter pylori</ScientificName> infection in
Western countries.  Reports have suggested that gastric infection with <ScientificName>H.
pylori</ScientificName> may protect the esophagus from GERD and its complications.<Reference refidx="11"/> 
According to this theory, <ScientificName>H. pylori</ScientificName> infections that cause pangastritis also
cause a decrease in gastric acid production that protects against GERD.<Reference refidx="12"/> 
Patients whose duodenal ulcers were treated successfully with antibiotics
developed reflux esophagitis twice as often as those in whom infection
persisted.<Reference refidx="13"/>  
</Para><Para id="_14">Past use of lower esophageal sphincter (LES)-relaxing drugs was positively
associated with risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.  Among daily, long-term
users (&gt;5 years) of LES-relaxing drugs, the estimated incidence rate ratio was
3.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2–6.4) compared with persons who had never used these
drugs.  Gastric cardia adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
were not associated with use of LES-relaxing drugs.<Reference refidx="14"/>
</Para><Para id="_15">There exists a strong relationship between body mass index (BMI) and esophageal
adenocarcinoma.  The adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 7.6 (95% CI, 3.8–15.2) among
persons in the highest BMI quartile compared with persons in the lowest.  Obese
persons (those with BMI &gt;30 kg/m<Superscript>2</Superscript>) had an OR of 16.2 (95% CI, 6.3–41.4) compared with the leanest persons (BMI &lt;22 kg/m<Superscript>2</Superscript>).  Esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma was not associated with BMI.<Reference refidx="15"/>

</Para><Para id="_19">Efforts at early detection of squamous cell cancer of the esophagus have
concentrated on cytological or endoscopic screening of populations in countries
where there is a high incidence.  Although these programs have demonstrated
that it is possible to detect squamous cell cancers in an early asymptomatic
stage, no data on efficacy (e.g., mortality reduction) have been published. 
Esophageal cytological screening studies have been reported from China,<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/>
Iran,<Reference refidx="13"/> South Africa,<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/> Italy,<Reference refidx="16"/> and Japan.<Reference refidx="17"/>  In the United States,
such efforts have been focused on individuals perceived to be at higher
risk.<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/>  Studies of primary endoscopic screening have been reported from
France <Reference refidx="20"/> and Japan.<Reference refidx="21"/>
</Para><Para id="_20">Comparisons of both Chinese and U.S. cytological diagnoses with concurrent
histological findings showed low (14%  to 36%) sensitivities for the cytological
detection of biopsy-proven cancers.  Specificity ranged from 90% to 99% with a
positive predictive value of 23% to 94%.<Reference refidx="22"/>  The development of uniform and
accurate cytological criteria will require formal cytological-histological
correlation studies of esophageal lesions.  Such studies should become more
feasible with the increasing availability of endoscopy in high-risk
populations.
</Para><Para id="_21">The efficacy of surveillance cytology or endoscopy for high-risk patients with
tylosis or long-standing achalasia is not known.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_22"><Title>Adenocarcinoma of the Esophagus</Title><Para id="_23">Considerable debate has ensued concerning the risk of cancer in patients with Barrett 
esophagus.  Prospective studies have reported annual esophageal cancer
incidence rates ranging from 0.2% to 1.9%.<Reference refidx="23"/>  Concern over publication bias
has led some authors to suggest that the risk may be lower than the literature 
suggests.<Reference refidx="24"/>  A risk of 0.5% per year for development of adenocarcinoma is now
thought to be a reasonable estimate for Barrett  esophagus.<Reference refidx="25"/>
</Para><Para id="_24">Barrett   esophagus is strongly associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease
(GERD), and the changes of Barrett esophagus can be found in approximately
10% of patients who have GERD.  However, GERD is very common; surveys have
found that approximately 20% of adult Americans experience symptoms of GERD,
such as heartburn, at least once each week.<Reference refidx="26"/>  The likelihood of finding
Barrett esophagus on endoscopy is related to the duration of symptoms of
gastroesophageal reflux.  In a series of 701 individuals, 4% of those with 
symptoms for less than 1 year had Barrett   esophagus on endoscopy, whereas
Barrett esophagus was found in 21% of those with more than 10 years of
symptoms of GERD.  It has been estimated that physicians identify only
approximately 5% of the population who have Barrett esophagus.<Reference refidx="27"/>      There is insufficient evidence that population screening for Barrett esophagus reduces cancer mortality.<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/></Para><Para id="_25">Surveillance of Barrett  esophagus involves the use of tests to identify
preneoplastic changes or curable neoplasms in patients who are known to have
Barrett   esophagus.  Certain factors are essential in the implementation of an
effective surveillance protocol, including low risk of the surveillance method,
correct histological diagnosis of dysplasia, proof that surgical resection for
high-grade dysplasia will decrease the risk of cancer, and successful resection
of cancer.  The interval between endoscopic evaluations is typically determined
by histologic findings, in accordance with published guidelines by
gastroenterological committees.<Reference refidx="30"/>  GERD  should be treated prior to
surveillance endoscopy to minimize confusion caused by inflammation in the
interpretation of biopsy specimens.  The technique of random, four-quadrant
biopsies taken every 2 cm in the columnar-lined esophagus for standard
histological evaluation has been recommended by some clinicians.  For patients
with no dysplasia, surveillance endoscopy at an interval of every 2 to 3 years
has been recommended.<Reference refidx="30"/>  For patients with low-grade dysplasia, surveillance
every 6 months for the first year has been recommended, followed by annual
endoscopy if the dysplasia has not progressed in severity.  For patients with
high-grade dysplasia, two options have been recommended: surgical
resection or repeated endoscopic evaluation until the diagnosis of intramucosal
carcinoma is made.  Although widely adopted in clinical practice, these
practices are based on uncontrolled series and the opinion of expert
gastrointestinal endoscopists and pathologists.

be sampled extensively include chromoendoscopy <Reference refidx="31"/> and laser-induced
fluorescence spectroscopy.<Reference refidx="29"/><Reference refidx="32"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_34"><Title>Evidence of Harm</Title><Para id="_51">Screening for esophageal cancer  by the use of blind nonendoscopically directed balloon cytological sampling for squamous cell carcinoma is minimally inconvenient and uncomfortable.
