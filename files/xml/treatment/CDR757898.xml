Others wish to let the disease  take its course when a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000318813">cure</GlossaryTermRef> is not expected. In the end stages of cancer, chemotherapy usually doesn't help you live longer and it may lower the quality of the time that remains. Each person and each cancer is different. Talking with your doctor about the  effects  of treatment and your <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef> can help you make a decision.

Pain and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000269453">symptom control</GlossaryTermRef> can be part of your care in any place of care, such as the hospital, home, and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044182">hospice</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_50"><KeyPoint id="_51">Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)</KeyPoint><Para id="_6">It's important to decide if you will want to have <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000744627">cardiopulmonary resuscitation</GlossaryTermRef> (CPR). CPR is a procedure used to try to restart the heart and breathing when it stops.   In <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000478743">advanced cancer</GlossaryTermRef>, the heart, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000270740">lungs</GlossaryTermRef>, and other <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000257523">organs</GlossaryTermRef> begin to fail and it's harder to restart them with CPR. Your doctor can help you  understand how CPR works and talk with you about whether CPR is likely to work for you.</Para><Para id="_19">People who are near the end of life may choose not to have CPR done. Your decision about having CPR is personal. Your own <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000441265">spiritual</GlossaryTermRef> or religious views about death and dying may help you decide. If you decide you don’t want CPR, you can ask your doctor to write a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000430480">do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order</GlossaryTermRef>. This tells other health care professionals not to perform CPR if your heart or breathing stops. You can remove the DNR order at any time.   
</Para><Para id="_20">Talk with your doctors and other <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000648947">caregivers</GlossaryTermRef> about CPR as early as possible (for example, when being admitted to the hospital), in case you’re not able to make the decision later.  If you do choose to have your doctor write a DNR, it’s important to tell all your family members and caregivers about it.</Para><Para id="_96">In the United States, if  there is no DNR order,  you will be given CPR  to keep you alive.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_52"><KeyPoint id="_53">Ventilator use</KeyPoint><Para id="_54">A <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454512">ventilator</GlossaryTermRef> is a machine used to help you breathe and keep you alive after normal breathing stops. It  doesn't treat a disease or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000651193">condition</GlossaryTermRef>. It's used only for life support. You can tell doctors whether you would want to be put on a ventilator if your lungs stop working  or if you cannot breathe on your own after CPR. If your goal of care is to live longer, you may choose to have a ventilator used. Or you may choose to 

have a ventilator for only a certain length of time.  It's important to tell your family and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000650566">health care providers</GlossaryTermRef> what you want before you have trouble breathing.

You will probably want to know how long you have to live. That's a hard question for doctors to answer. It can be different for each person and depends on  the type of cancer, where it has spread, and whether you have other illnesses. Treatments can work differently for each person.   Your doctor can talk about the treatment options with you and your family and explain the effects they may have on  your cancer and your <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef>. Knowing the benefits  and risks of  available treatments can help you decide on your goals of care for the last <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045885">stages</GlossaryTermRef> of the cancer. </Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Decide on your care goals</Strong><Para id="_93">Your care goals for advanced cancer depend in part on whether  quality of life or length of life is more important to you.

During active treatment to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000318813">cure</GlossaryTermRef> the cancer, supportive care helps you stay healthy and comfortable enough to continue receiving the cancer treatments. In the last <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045885">stages</GlossaryTermRef> of cancer, when a cure is no longer the goal, supportive care is used for side effects that continue.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_45"><KeyPoint id="_46">Palliative  care</KeyPoint><Para id="_114">Palliative care is specialized medical care for people with serious or life-threatening illnesses. The focus of palliative care is relief from pain and other symptoms, both during active treatment and when treatment has been stopped. Palliative care is offered in some hospitals, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044520">outpatient</GlossaryTermRef> centers, and in the home.

</Para><Para id="_73">Palliative care helps to improve your <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045417">quality of life</GlossaryTermRef> by preventing and relieving suffering. When you're more comfortable, your family's quality of life may also be better.  Palliative care includes treating physical symptoms such as pain, and helping you and your family with emotional, social, and spiritual concerns. When palliative treatment is given at the end of life, the focus is on relieving symptoms and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454701">distress</GlossaryTermRef> caused by the process of dying and to make sure your goals of care are followed.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_48"><KeyPoint id="_49">Hospice care</KeyPoint><Para id="_36">When treatment is no longer helping, you may choose hospice. Hospice is a program that gives care to people who are near the end of life and have stopped treatment to cure or control their cancer. Hospice care focuses on quality of life rather than length of life. The hospice team offers physical, emotional, and spiritual support for patients who are expected to live no longer than six months. The goal of hospice is to help patients live each day to the fullest by making them comfortable and relieving their symptoms. This may include supportive and  palliative care to control pain and other symptoms so you can be as alert and comfortable as possible. Services to help with the emotional, social, and spiritual needs of you and your family are also an important part of hospice care.</Para><Para id="_37">Hospice programs are designed to keep the patient at home with family and friends, but hospice care may also be given in hospice centers and in some hospitals and nursing homes. The hospice team includes doctors, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000269445">nurses</GlossaryTermRef>, spiritual advisors, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044730">social workers</GlossaryTermRef>, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044662">nutritionists</GlossaryTermRef>, and volunteers. Team members are specially trained on issues that occur at the end of life. The hospice program continues to give help, including <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000476410">grief counseling</GlossaryTermRef>, to the family after their loved one dies.

When that happens, would you prefer to have your doctor and family make decisions? Or would you rather make decisions early, so your wishes will be known and can be followed when the time comes?

In addition to decisions about relieving <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045022">symptoms</GlossaryTermRef> at the end of life, it is also helpful to decide if and when you want certain treatments to stop. Advance  directives make sure your wishes about treatments and life-saving procedures to keep you alive are known ahead of time. Without knowing your wishes, doctors will do everything medically possible to
keep you alive, such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000744627">cardiopulmonary resuscitation</GlossaryTermRef> (CPR) and the use of a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454512">ventilator</GlossaryTermRef> (breathing machine).</Para><Para id="_112">Each state has its own laws for advance directives.

You do not have to state specific decisions about individual treatments in the document, just state that the proxy will make medical decisions for you. HCP is also known as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000430482">durable power of attorney</GlossaryTermRef> for health care (DPOAHC) or medical <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000478748">power of attorney</GlossaryTermRef> (MPOA).

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works.
