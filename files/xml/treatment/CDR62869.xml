acute myelogenous leukemia, acute nonlymphocytic leukemia [ANLL]) have resulted in substantially improved
complete remission (CR) rates.<Reference refidx="2"/>  Treatment should be sufficiently aggressive to
achieve CR because partial remission offers no substantial
survival benefit.  Approximately 60% to 70% of adults with AML can be expected
to attain CR status following appropriate induction therapy. 
More than 25% of adults with AML (about 45% of those who attain CR) can be expected to survive 3 or more years and may be cured. 
Remission rates in adult AML are inversely related to age, with an expected
remission rate of more than 65% for those younger than 60 years. 
Data suggest that once attained, duration of remission may be shorter in older
patients.  Increased morbidity and mortality during induction appear to be
directly related to age.  Other adverse prognostic factors include central
nervous system involvement with leukemia, systemic infection at diagnosis,
elevated white blood cell count (&gt;100,000/mm<Superscript>3</Superscript>),
treatment-induced AML, and history of myelodysplastic syndromes or another antecedent hematological disorder.  Patients with leukemias that
express the progenitor cell antigen CD34 and/or the P-glycoprotein (<GeneName>MDR1</GeneName> gene
product) have an inferior outcome.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>    
AML associated with an internal tandem duplication of the <GeneName>FLT3</GeneName> gene (<GeneName>FLT3</GeneName>/ITD mutation) has an inferior outcome that is attributed to a higher relapse rate.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/></Para><SummarySection id="_391"><Title>Cytogenetic analysis</Title><Para id="_3">Cytogenetic analysis provides some of the strongest prognostic information
available,  predicting outcome of both remission induction and postremission
therapy, as seen in a trial  from the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) (E-3489).<Reference refidx="8"/>  Cytogenetic abnormalities that indicate a good prognosis include
t(8; 21), inv(16) or t(16;16), and t(15;17).  Normal cytogenetics portends average-risk AML. 
Patients with AML that is characterized by deletions of the long arms or
monosomies of chromosomes 5 or 7; by translocations or inversions of chromosome
3, t(6; 9), t(9; 22); or by abnormalities of chromosome 11q23 have particularly
poor prognoses with chemotherapy.  These cytogenetic subgroups,  as seen in  the trial from  the Medical Research Council (MRC-LEUK-AML11), predict clinical
outcome in older patients with AML as well as in younger patients.<Reference refidx="9"/>  The
fusion genes formed in t(8; 21) and inv(16) can be detected by
reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) or fluorescence <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> hybridization (FISH), which will indicate
the presence of these genetic alterations in some patients in whom standard
cytogenetics was technically inadequate.  RT–PCR does not appear to identify
significant numbers of patients with good-risk fusion genes who have normal
cytogenetics.<Reference refidx="10"/>

This threshold value for blast percentage eliminated the category “refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation” (RAEB-t) found in the FAB classification of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), where RAEB-t is defined by a marrow blast percentage between 20% and 29%.

The patient exhibits the following features: abnormal bone marrow with at least 20% blasts and signs and symptoms of the disease, usually accompanied by an abnormal white blood cell count and differential, an abnormal hematocrit/hemoglobin count, and an abnormal platelet count.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_335"><Para id="_336"><Strong>In Remission</Strong></Para><Para id="_337">AML in remission is defined as a normal peripheral blood cell count (absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,000/mm<Superscript>3</Superscript> and platelet count &gt;100,000/mm<Superscript>3</Superscript>) <Reference refidx="1"/> and normocellular marrow with less than 5% blasts in the marrow and no signs or symptoms of the disease. In addition, no signs or symptoms are evident of central nervous system leukemia or other extramedullary infiltration. Because the vast majority of AML patients meeting these criteria for remission have residual leukemia, modifications to the definition of complete remission have been suggested, including cytogenetic remission, in which a previously abnormal karyotype reverts to normal, and molecular remission, in which interphase fluorescence <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> hybridization (FISH) or multiparameter flow cytometry are used to detect minimal residual disease.

bone marrow and systemic disease and specific treatment of central nervous
system (CNS) disease, if present.  The cornerstone of this strategy includes
systemically administered combination chemotherapy.  Because only 5% of
patients with AML develop CNS disease, prophylactic treatment is not
indicated.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>
</Para><Para id="_49">Treatment is divided into two phases:  remission induction (to attain remission) and
postremission (to maintain remission).  Maintenance therapy for AML was
previously administered for several years but is not included in most current
treatment clinical trials in the United States, other than for acute promyelocytic leukemia. (Refer to  the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062869#_67" url="/types/leukemia/hp/adult-aml-treatment-pdq">Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Remission
</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information.)  Other studies have used more intensive
postremission therapy administered for a shorter duration of time after which
treatment is discontinued.<Reference refidx="4"/>  Postremission therapy appears to be effective
when given immediately after remission is achieved.<Reference refidx="4"/> 
</Para><Para id="_50">Since myelosuppression is an anticipated consequence of both the leukemia and
its treatment with chemotherapy, patients must be closely monitored during
therapy.  Facilities must be available for hematologic support with multiple
blood fractions including platelet transfusions and for the treatment
of related infectious complications.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Randomized trials have shown similar
outcomes for patients who received prophylactic platelet transfusions at a
level of 10,000/mm<Superscript>3</Superscript> rather than 20,000/mm<Superscript>3</Superscript>.<Reference refidx="6"/>  The incidence of platelet alloimmunization was similar among
groups randomly assigned to receive pooled platelet concentrates from random
donors; filtered, pooled platelet concentrates from random donors; ultraviolet
B-irradiated, pooled platelet concentrates from random donors; or filtered
platelets obtained by apheresis from single random donors.<Reference refidx="7"/> 
Colony-stimulating factors, for example, granulocyte colony–stimulating factor (G-CSF)
and granulocyte-macrophage colony–stimulating factor (GM-CSF), have been
studied in an effort to shorten the period of granulocytopenia associated with
leukemia treatment.<Reference refidx="8"/>  If used, these agents are administered after completion
of induction therapy.  GM-CSF was shown to improve survival in a randomized
trial of AML in patients aged 55 to 70 years (median survival was 10.6 months
vs. 4.8 months).  In this Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) (EST-1490) trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive GM-CSF
or placebo following demonstration of leukemic clearance of the bone marrow;<Reference refidx="9"/> 
however, GM-CSF did not show benefit in a separate similar randomized trial in
patients older than 60 years.<Reference refidx="10"/>  In the latter study, clearance of the marrow
was not required before initiating cytokine therapy.  In a Southwest Oncology Group   (<ProtocolRef href="CDR0000650298" nct_id="NCT00023777">NCT00023777</ProtocolRef>)  randomized trial of
G-CSF given following induction therapy to patients older than 65 years, complete
response was higher in patients who received G-CSF because of  a decreased
incidence of primary leukemic resistance.  Growth factor administration did not
impact on mortality or on survival.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/> Because  the majority of randomized clinical trials have not shown an impact of growth factors on survival, their use is not routinely recommended in the remission induction setting.
</Para><Para id="_51">The administration of GM-CSF or other myeloid growth factors before and during
induction therapy, to augment the effects of cytotoxic therapy through the
recruitment of leukemic blasts into cell cycle (growth factor priming), has
been an area of active clinical research.  Evidence from randomized studies of
GM-CSF priming have come to opposite conclusions.  A randomized study of GM-CSF
priming during conventional induction and postremission therapy showed no
difference in outcomes between patients who received GM-CSF and those who did
not receive growth factor priming.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335125">Level of evidence: 1iiA</LOERef>]  In

survival  (DFS) or cure with a single cycle of chemotherapy,<Reference refidx="1"/> postremission therapy
is always indicated in therapy that is planned with curative intent.  In a
small randomized study conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG), all
patients who did not receive postremission therapy experienced a relapse after
a short median complete remission (CR) duration.<Reference refidx="2"/>  Current approaches to
postremission therapy include short-term, relatively intensive chemotherapy
with cytarabine-based regimens similar to standard induction clinical trials
(postremission chemotherapy), postremission chemotherapy with more
dose-intensive cytarabine-based treatment, high-dose chemotherapy or
chemoradiation therapy with autologous bone marrow rescue, and high-dose
marrow-ablative therapy with allogeneic bone marrow rescue.  While older
studies have included longer-term therapy at lower doses (maintenance), no convincing evidence is available with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that maintenance therapy provides prolonged
DFS beyond shorter-term, more dose-intensive approaches, and
few current treatment clinical trials include maintenance therapy.
</Para><Para id="_70">Nontransplant postremission therapy using cytarabine-containing regimens has
treatment-related death rates that are usually less than 10% to 20% and have
yielded reported long-term DFS rates from 20% to 50%.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>  A large,
randomized trial  that compared three different cytarabine-containing
postremission therapy regimens showed a clear benefit in survival to patients younger
than 60 years who received high-dose cytarabine.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Intensification of
cytarabine dose or duration of postremission chemotherapy with conventionally dosed cytarabine did not improve DFS or OS in patients aged 60 years or older, as evidenced in the Medical Research Council (MRC-LEUK-AML11) trial.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/>  The duration of postremission therapy has
ranged from one cycle <Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="6"/> to four or more cycles.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="5"/>  The standard postremission therapy for AML patients in remission is high-dose cytarabine; however, there exists some controversy about whether it benefits all younger AML patients in first complete response versus selected subgroups, such as those with core-binding factor abnormalities.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/>  The optimal doses,
schedules, and duration of postremission chemotherapy have not been determined. 
Therefore, to address these issues, patients with AML should be included in
clinical trials at institutions that treat large numbers of such patients.
</Para><Para id="_71">Dose-intensive cytarabine-based chemotherapy can be complicated by severe
neurologic <Reference refidx="14"/> and/or pulmonary toxic effects <Reference refidx="15"/> and should be administered
by physicians experienced in these regimens at centers that are equipped to
deal with potential complications.  In a retrospective analysis of 256 patients
who received high-dose bolus cytarabine at a single institution, the most
powerful predictor of cytarabine neurotoxicity was renal insufficiency.  The
incidence of neurotoxicity was significantly greater in patients treated with
twice daily doses of 3 g/m<Superscript>2</Superscript>/dose when compared with 2
g/m<Superscript>2</Superscript>/dose.
</Para><Para id="_72">Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) results in the lowest incidence of
leukemic relapse, even when compared with BMT from an
identical twin (syngeneic BMT).  This has led to the
concept of an immunologic graft-versus-leukemia effect, similar to (and related
to) graft-versus-host disease.  The improvement in freedom from relapse using
allogeneic BMT as the primary postremission therapy is
offset, at least in part, by the increased morbidity and mortality caused by
graft-versus-host disease, veno-occlusive disease of the liver, and
interstitial pneumonitis.  The DFS  rates using allogeneic
transplantation in first complete remission (CR) have ranged from 45% to 60%.<Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/> 
The use of allogeneic BMT as primary postremission
therapy is limited by the need for a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched
sibling donor and the increased mortality from allogeneic BMT of patients who are older than 50 years.  The mortality
from allogeneic BMT that uses an HLA-matched sibling
donor ranges from 20% to 40%, depending on the series.  The use of matched,
unrelated donors for allogeneic BMT is being evaluated
at many centers but has a very substantial rate of treatment-related mortality,
with DFS rates less than 35%.<Reference refidx="19"/>  Retrospective analysis of
data from the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry suggests that
postremission chemotherapy does not lead to an improvement in DFS or
OS for patients in first remission undergoing allogeneic BMT from an HLA-identical sibling.<Reference refidx="20"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335150">Level of evidence: 3iiiA</LOERef>]
</Para><Para id="_342">A common clinical trial design used to evaluate the benefit of allogeneic transplant as consolidation therapy for AML in first remission is the so-called <Emphasis>donor-no donor</Emphasis> comparison.  In this design, newly diagnosed AML patients who achieve a CR have one or more siblings, and are deemed medically eligible for allogeneic transplant, undergo HLA typing.  If a sibling donor is identified, the patient is allocated to the transplantation arm.  Analysis of outcome is by intention to treat; that is, patients assigned to the donor arm who do not receive a transplant are grouped in the analysis with the patients who did actually receive a transplant.  Relapse-free survival (RFS) is the usual endpoint for this type of trial.  Overall survival (OS) from the time of diagnosis is less frequently reported in these trials.  Results of these trials have been mixed, with some trials showing a clear benefit across all cytogenetic subgroups, and others showing no benefit.</Para><Para id="_341">  Investigators attempted to address this issue with a meta-analysis using data from 18 separate prospective trials of AML patients using the <Emphasis>donor-no donor</Emphasis> design, with data from an additional six trials included for sensitivity analysis.<Reference refidx="21"/>   The trials included in this meta-analysis enrolled adult patients aged 60 and younger during the years 1982 to 2006.  Median follow-up ranged from 42 months to 142 months.  Preparative regimens were similar among the different trials.  Allogeneic transplant was compared with autologous transplant (6 trials) or with a variety of consolidation chemotherapy regimens, with high-dose cytarabine being the most common.  </Para><Para id="_349">Treatment-related mortality ranged from 5% to 42% in the donor groups compared with 3% to 27% in the no-donor group.  Of 18 trials reporting RFS across all cytogenetic risk groups, the combined hazard ratio (HR) for overall RFS benefit with allogeneic transplant was 0.80, indicating a statistically significant reduction in death or relapse in a first CR.  Of the 15 trials reporting OS across all cytogenetic risk groups, the combined HR for OS was 0.90, again indicating a statistically significant reduction in death or relapse in a first CR.  </Para><Para id="_350">In subgroup analysis according to cytogenetic risk category, there was no RFS or OS benefit of allogeneic transplant for patients with good-risk AML (RFS: HR, 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI],  0.83–1.38; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .59; OS: HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.64–1.76; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .81).  However, a transplant benefit was seen for patients with intermediate (RFS: HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74–0.93; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .01; OS: HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71–0.99; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .03) or poor-risk  cytogenetics (RFS: HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59–0.90; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .01; OS: HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40–0.90; <Emphasis>P </Emphasis>= .01).  The conclusion from this meta-analysis was that allogeneic transplant from a sibling donor in a first CR is justified on the basis of improved RFS and OS for patients with intermediate- or poor-risk, but not good-risk, cytogenetics.<Reference refidx="21"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335132">Level of evidence: 2A</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_356">An important caveat to this analysis is that induction and postremission strategies for AML among studies included in the meta-analysis were not uniform; nor were definitions of cytogenetic risk groups uniform. This may have resulted in inferior survival rates among chemotherapy-only treated patients. Most U.S. leukemia physicians agree that transplantation should be offered to AML patients in first CR in the setting of poor-risk cytogenetics  and should not be offered to patients in first CR with good-risk cytogenetics.</Para><Para id="_343">The use of matched,

patients with de novo AML treated with allogeneic or autologous BMT in first remission in whom cytogenetic analysis at diagnosis
was available, patients with poor-risk cytogenetics (abnormalities of
chromosomes 5, 7, 11q, or hypodiploidy) had less favorable outcomes following
allogeneic BMT than patients with normal karyotypes or
other cytogenetic abnormalities.  Leukemia-free survival for the patients in

</Para><Para id="_78">Because BMT can cure about 30% of patients who
experience relapse following chemotherapy, some investigators suggested that
allogeneic BMT can be reserved for early first relapse
or second CR without compromising the number of patients who
are ultimately cured;<Reference refidx="38"/>  however, clinical and cytogenetic information can
define certain subsets of patients with predictable better or worse prognoses
in those using postremission chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="39"/>  Good-risk factors include t(8; 21),
inv(16) associated with M4 AML with eosinophilia, normal karyotype with <GeneName>NPM1</GeneName> mutation (in absence of <GeneName>flt-3</GeneName> mutation), and normal karyotype with double cytosine-cytosine-adenosine-adenosine-thymidine (CCAAT)-enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)-alpha mutations.  Poor-risk factors include deletion of 5q and 7q, trisomy 8, t(6; 9),
t(9; 22), most translocations involving chromosome 11q23, and mutations of the MLL gene,  a history of myelodysplasia or antecedent hematologic disorder, and normal karyotype with <GeneName>flt-3</GeneName> mutation. 
Patients in the good-risk group have a reasonable chance of cure with intensive
postremission therapy, and it may be reasonable to defer transplantation in that group
until early first relapse.  The poor-risk group is unlikely to be cured with
postremission chemotherapy, and allogeneic BMT in first CR is a reasonable option for patients with an HLA-identical
sibling donor.  However, even with allogeneic stem cell transplantation, the
outcome for patients with high-risk AML is poor (5-year DFS
of 8% to 30% for patients with treatment-related leukemia or
myelodysplasia).<Reference refidx="40"/>  The efficacy of autologous stem cell transplantation in
the poor-risk group has not been reported to date but is the subject of active
clinical trials.  Patients with normal cytogenetics are in an intermediate-risk
group, and postremission management should be individualized or, ideally,
managed according to a clinical trial.
</Para><Para id="_79">The rapid engraftment kinetics of peripheral blood progenitor cells
demonstrated in trials of high-dose therapy for epithelial neoplasms has led to
interest in the alternative use of autologous and allogeneic peripheral blood
progenitor cells as rescue for myeloablative therapy for the treatment of AML. 
One pilot trial of the use of autologous transplantation with unpurged
peripheral blood progenitor cells in first remission had a 3-year DFS rate of 35%; detailed prognostic factors for these patients were not
provided.<Reference refidx="24"/>  This result appears inferior to the best results of chemotherapy

In a randomized trial of 175 patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation,  with either bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells, for a variety of hematologic malignancies using methotrexate and cyclosporine to prevent graft-versus-host disease, the use of peripheral blood progenitor cells led to earlier engraftment (median neutrophil engraftment, 16 vs. 21 days; median platelet engraftment, 13 vs. 19 days).<Reference refidx="41"/>  The use of peripheral blood progenitor cells was associated with a trend toward increased graft-versus-host disease but comparable transplant-related death.

rate in patients with relapsed AML expressing CD33.  This included 16% of
patients who achieved CRs and 13% of patients who achieved a CRp, a new
response criteria defined for this trial.  CRp refers to clearance of leukemic
blasts from the marrow, with adequate myeloid and erythroid recovery but with
incomplete platelet recovery (although platelet transfusion independence for at
least 1 week was required).  Unclear is whether the inadequate platelet
recovery is the result of  megakaryocyte toxic effects of gemtuzumab or subclinical
residual leukemia.  The long-term outcomes of patients who achieve CRp
following gemtuzumab are not yet known.  Gemtuzumab induces profound bone
marrow aplasia similar to leukemia induction chemotherapy and also has
substantial hepatic toxic effects, including hepatic venoocclusive
disease.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/>  The farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib (R115777) demonstrated a 32%

</Para><Para id="_302">Patients who relapse following an allogeneic BMT may undergo an infusion of lymphocytes from the donor (donor lymphocyte infusion or DLI), similar to the therapy patients with relapsing chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) undergo.

There are no published studies of any prospective trials examining the role of DLI for patients with AML who relapsed following allogeneic BMT.  A retrospective study of European patients found that, out of 399 patients who relapsed after an allogeneic BMT, 171 patients received DLI as part of their salvage therapy.<Reference refidx="22"/>  A multivariate analysis of survival showed a significant advantage for the 171 DLI recipients, who achieved a 2-year overall survival from the time of relapse of 21%, compared to 9% for the 228 patients who did not receive DLI (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .04; RR, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.64–0.99).<Reference refidx="22"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335150">Level of evidence: 3iiiA</LOERef>]  The strength of this finding is limited by the retrospective nature of the study, and the possibility that much of the survival advantage could have been the result of selection bias.  Furthermore, the remission rate of 34% reported in this study was considerably less than the 67% to 91% reported for CML.<Reference refidx="23"/>  Therefore, even if the survival advantage conferred by DLI is real, the fraction of relapsed AML patients who might benefit from this therapy appears to be quite limited.</Para><Para id="_86">Arsenic trioxide, an agent with both differentiation-inducing and apoptosis-inducing
properties against acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells, has a high rate of
successful remission induction in patients with relapsed APL.  Clinical CRs have been reported in 85% of
patients induced with arsenic trioxide, with a median time to clinical CR of 59 days.  Eighty-six percent of evaluable patients tested negative
for the presence of <GeneName>PML</GeneName>-<GeneName>RARA</GeneName> transcript after induction or postremission therapy
with arsenic trioxide.  Actuarial 18-month relapse-free survival was 56%.

neuropathy.<Reference refidx="24"/><Reference refidx="25"/>

promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients could reduce the total amount of therapy administered (cited Gore et al. as reference 50).</Para><Para id="_424">Added <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062869#_405" url="/types/leukemia/hp/adult-aml-treatment-pdq">text</SummaryRef> to state that this approach was investigated in a randomized,  noninferiority trial that compared ATO plus ATRA with an ATRA-anthracycline-based regimen in patients with lower-risk APL.   Also added EFS rates in the ATRA-ATO group and the ATRA-chemotherapy group and OS rates for ATRA-ATO patients at the  median follow-up of 34.4 months (cited Lo-Coco et al. as reference 52).</Para><Para id="_428">Added <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062869#_406" url="/types/leukemia/hp/adult-aml-treatment-pdq">text</SummaryRef> to state that most current regimens for the treatment of APL include some form of maintenance therapy, particularly for patients with higher-risk APL.
