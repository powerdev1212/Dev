cancer should be referred to medical centers that have a multidisciplinary team
of cancer specialists with experience treating the cancers that occur during
childhood and adolescence.  This multidisciplinary team approach incorporates the skills
of the following health care professionals and others to ensure that children receive treatment, supportive care, and rehabilitation
that will achieve optimal survival and quality of life:</Para><ItemizedList id="_778" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Primary care physicians.</ListItem><ListItem>Pediatric surgeons.</ListItem><ListItem>Radiation oncologists. </ListItem><ListItem>Pediatric medical oncologists/hematologists.</ListItem><ListItem>Rehabilitation specialists.</ListItem><ListItem>Pediatric nurse specialists.</ListItem><ListItem>Social workers.</ListItem><ListItem>Child life professionals.</ListItem><ListItem>Psychologists.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_779">(Refer to the PDQ <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/information-summaries/supportive-care">Supportive and Palliative Care</ExternalRef> summaries for specific information about supportive care for children and adolescents with cancer.)</Para><Para id="_91">Guidelines for pediatric cancer
centers and their role in the treatment of children and adolescents with cancer have
been outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics.<Reference refidx="2"/>  At these pediatric
cancer centers, clinical trials are available for most types of cancer
that occur in children and adolescents, and the opportunity to participate in
these trials is offered to most patients/families.  Clinical trials for
children and adolescents with cancer are generally designed to compare
potentially better therapy with therapy that is currently accepted as standard. 
Most of the progress made in identifying curative therapies for
childhood cancers has been achieved through clinical trials.  Information about
ongoing clinical trials is available from the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials">NCI website</ExternalRef>.</Para><Para id="_107">Dramatic improvements in survival have been achieved for children and adolescents with cancer. Between 1975 and 2010, childhood cancer mortality decreased by more than 50%.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Childhood and adolescent cancer survivors require close monitoring because late effects of therapy may persist or develop months or years after treatment.

Their diagnoses may be challenging, in part, because of the lack of consensus regarding a classification system. Systematic central histopathological review of these tumors
performed as part of pediatric collaborative therapeutic protocols has allowed the identification of
histologic subtypes with distinct clinical associations. As a result, histopathology has been incorporated within
the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) protocols and, in the United States, as a risk-stratification parameter
used for patient management. </Para><Para id="_757">The COG Liver Tumor Committee sponsored an International Pathology
Symposium in 2011 to discuss the histopathology and classification of pediatric liver tumors (hepatoblastoma, in particular), and work towards an International Pediatric Liver Tumors Consensus
Classification that would be required for international collaborative projects. Twenty-two pathologists and
experts in pediatric liver tumors, including those serving as central reviewers for the COG, European Société
Internationale d’Oncologie Pédiatrique (International Society of Paediatric Oncology), Gesellschaft für Pädiatrische Onkologie und Hämatologie (Society for Paediatric Oncology and Haematology), and
Japanese Study Group for Pediatric Liver Tumors protocols, as well as pediatric oncologists and surgeons
specialized in this field, reviewed more than 50 pediatric liver tumor cases. They discussed classic and newly
reported entities, and criteria for their classification. This symposium represented the first collaborative
step toward developing a classification that may lead to a common treatment-stratification system incorporating tumor
histopathology. The results of this international classification for pediatric liver tumors have been published.<Reference refidx="1"/>  It is too soon to know whether the international classification system will be generally accepted among pediatric pathologists. A standardized, clinically meaningful classification is needed to allow the
integration of new biological parameters and tumor genetics, which could improve future patient management and outcome.

Internationale d’Oncologie Pédiatrique–Epithelial Liver Tumor Study Group (SIOPEL)], Children's Oncology Group [COG], Gesellschaft für Pädiatrische Onkologie und Hämatologie [Society for Paediatric Oncology and Haematology], and
Japanese Study Group for Pediatric Liver Tumors) have had disparate risk stratification categories, making it difficult to compare outcomes across continents. All groups are now using the PRE-Treatment EXTent of tumor (PRETEXT) grouping system as part of the risk stratification.</Para><Para id="_762">The primary treatment goal for patients with liver cancer is surgical extirpation of all disease. Therefore, the risk grouping designed to stratify treatment depends heavily on factors related to safe surgical resection of the tumor. This risk grouping uses imaging to define factors that determine the likelihood of safe and successful surgical resection.</Para><Para id="_616">The importance of high-quality, cross-sectional imaging to evaluate children with hepatoblastoma is paramount because the risk stratification that defines treatment is very dependent on imaging analysis.  Three-phase computed tomography scanning (non-contrast, arterial, and venous) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast agents are used for imaging.  MRI with gadoxetate disodium (Eovist), a gadolinium-based agent that is preferentially taken up and excreted by hepatocytes, is being used with increased frequency and may improve detection of multifocal disease.</Para><Para id="_178">There are two grouping systems  used for hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma that radiographically define the extent of liver involvement by the tumor:</Para><ItemizedList id="_614" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>PRETEXT (PRE-Treatment EXTent of disease):  The extent of liver involvement is defined <Emphasis>before</Emphasis> therapy.</ListItem><ListItem>POSTTEXT (POST-Treatment EXTent of disease): The extent of liver involvement is defined <Emphasis>after</Emphasis> therapy.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_615">In SIOPEL studies, all children with hepatoblastoma have been treated with chemotherapy before attempted resection of the primary tumor. Hence, surgical staging has not been possible.</Para><SummarySection id="_728"><Title>PRETEXT  and POSTTEXT Groups</Title><Para id="_617">PRETEXT is now used by the major multicenter trial groups as a central component of risk stratification schemes that define treatment of hepatoblastoma. The PRETEXT groups were devised by the SIOPEL for their first trial, SIOPEL-1 <Reference refidx="1"/> and revised for SIOPEL-3 in 2007.<Reference refidx="2"/> PRETEXT is based on an analysis of cross-sectional imaging of the extent of tumor involvement of the four main sections of the liver:  </Para><ItemizedList id="_781" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Right posterior section (Couinaud 6, 7).</ListItem><ListItem>Right anterior section (Couinaud 5, 8).</ListItem><ListItem>Left medial section (Couinaud 4a, 4b).</ListItem><ListItem>Left lateral section (Couinaud 2, 3).  </ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_619">PRETEXT group assignment I, II, III, or IV is determined by the number of contiguous uninvolved sections of the liver.  PRETEXT is further annotated with a V, P, E, M, C, F, N, or R depending on extension of tumor beyond the hepatic parenchyma of the major sections.  </Para><Para id="_716">Annotations have been added to identify multifocality (F) and preoperative tumor rupture (R). (Refer to <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062836#_696" url="/types/liver/hp/child-liver-treatment-pdq">Table   1</SummaryRef> for detailed descriptions of the PRETEXT groups and annotations.)</Para><Para id="_717">The extent of tumor involvement of the major vessels and its effect on venous inflow and outflow is critical knowledge for the surgeon and can affect surgical outcomes.  Portal involvement of the main portal vein and/or both right and left portal veins can be further described as the following:  </Para><ItemizedList id="_718" Style="bullet"><ListItem>P0: Tumor within 1 cm.</ListItem><ListItem>P1: Tumor touching.</ListItem><ListItem>P2: Tumor compressing or distorting.</ListItem><ListItem>P3: Tumor ingrowth, encasement, or thrombus.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_763">The same vascular involvement definitions apply to venous involvement, V0–V3. Vascular involvement is critical in determining the resectability of a liver tumor. It should be noted that there are differences in the definitions of vascular involvement used by the COG and major liver surgery centers in the United States compared with SIOPEL definitions used in Europe.</Para><Para id="_719">Although PRETEXT can be used to predict tumor resectability, there are limitations. The distinction between real invasion beyond the anatomic border of a given hepatic section and the compression and displacement by the tumor can be very difficult, especially at diagnosis.  Additionally, distinguishing between vessel encroachment and involvement can be difficult, particularly if inadequate imaging is obtained. The PRETEXT group assignment has a moderate degree of interobserver variability, and the preoperative PRETEXT group agrees with postoperative pathologic findings only 51% of the time, with overstaging in 37% of patients and understaging in 12% of patients.<Reference refidx="3"/> </Para><Para id="_764">Because distinguishing PRETEXT group assignment is difficult, central review of imaging is generally performed in major clinical trials. For patients not enrolled on clinical trials, expert radiologic review should be considered in questionable cases in which the PRETEXT group assignment affects choice of treatment. </Para><Para id="_727">The posttreatment extent of disease (POSTTEXT) is typically obtained after every two cycles of chemotherapy, about 10 days after the completion of a chemotherapy cycle.  It has been shown that most chemotherapy response occurs after the first two cycles of chemotherapy.<Reference refidx="4"/> Also, a study that evaluated surgical resectability after two versus four cycles of chemotherapy showed that many tumors may be resectable after two cycles.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Table id="_696"><Title>Table 1.

Metastasis from the placenta to maternal tissues occurs in many cases, necessitating beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) testing of the mother. Infants are often unstable at diagnosis because of hemorrhage of the tumor.
