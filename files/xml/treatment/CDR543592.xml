A report of the Dartmouth Atlas Project analyzed Medicare data from 2003 to 2007 for cancer patients older than 65 years who died within 1 year of diagnosis.<Reference refidx="2"/> Across the United States, 29% of patients died in a hospital, with 61.3% hospitalized at least once in the last month of life. In addition, 24% of patients were admitted to an intensive care unit at least once. Approximately 6% of patients nationwide received chemotherapy in the last month of life. Conversely, about 55% of patients who died used hospice service; however, the average length of stay was only 8.7 days, and 8.3% of patients were enrolled in the last 3 days of life. Significant regional variations in the descriptors of end-of-life (EOL) care remain unexplained.</Para><Para id="_283">Patient and family preferences may contribute to the observed patterns of care at the EOL. Patient recall of EOL discussions, spiritual care, or early palliative care, however, are associated with less-aggressive EOL treatment and/or increased utilization of hospice.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/> In addition, death in a hospital has been associated with poorer quality of life and increased risk of psychiatric illness among bereaved caregivers.<Reference refidx="8"/> (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000755559" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/planning/end-of-life-hp-pdq">Planning the Transition to End-of-Life Care in Advanced Cancer</SummaryRef> for more information.)

For example, one group of investigators <Reference refidx="3"/> retrospectively analyzed nearly 71,000 Palliative Performance Scale (PPS) scores obtained from a cohort of 11,374 adult outpatients with cancer who were assessed by physicians or nurses at the time of clinic visits.  The PPS is an 11-point scale describing a patient’s level of ambulation, level of activity, evidence of disease, ability to perform self-care, nutritional intake, and level of consciousness.</Para><Para id="_302">The investigators assigned patients to one of four states:</Para><ItemizedList id="_303" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Stable (PPS score, 70–100).</ListItem><ListItem> Transitional (PPS score, 40–60).</ListItem><ListItem>EOL (PPS score, 10–30).</ListItem><ListItem>Dead.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_304">Of the 4,806 patients who died during the study period, 49% were recorded as being in the transitional state, and 46% were recorded  as being in the stable state. For a patient who was in the transitional state, the probability of dying within a month  was 24.1%, which was less than that for a patient in the EOL state (73.5%). The results suggest that serial measurement of the PPS may aid patients and clinicians in identifying the approach of the EOL.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_285"><Title>Impending Death</Title><Para id="_286">Impending death, or actively dying, refers to the process in which patients who are expected to die within 3 days exhibit a constellation of symptoms.<Reference refidx="4"/> In the final days of life, patients often experience progressive decline in their neurocognitive, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and muscular function, which is  characteristic of the dying process. A number of highly specific clinical signs can be used to help clinicians establish the diagnosis of impending death (i.e., death within days).<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_287">Impending death is a diagnostic issue rather than a prognostic phenomenon because it is an irreversible physiologic process. The ability to diagnose impending death with confidence is of utmost importance to clinicians because it could affect their communication with patients and families, and inform complex health care decisions such as hospital discharge, discontinuation of prescription medications, artificial nutrition, use of life support measures, and enrollment on clinical care pathways.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> Because clinicians often overestimate survival,<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/> they often hesitate to diagnose impending death without adequate supporting evidence.</Para><Para id="_288">One study examined five signs in cancer patients, beginning when they were recognized as actively dying.  Investigators reported that the median time to death from the onset of death rattle was 23 hours; from the onset of respiration with mandibular movement, 2.5 hours; from the onset of cyanosis in extremities, 1 hour; and from the onset of pulselessness on the radial artery, 2.6 hours.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_289">The Investigating the Process of Dying study systematically  examined physical signs in 357 consecutive cancer patients.<Reference refidx="6"/>  Among the ten target physical signs, there were three early signs and seven late signs.  The early signs had high frequency, occurred more than 1 week before death, and had moderate predictive value that a patient would die in 3 days. Early signs included the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_290" Style="bullet" Compact="No">
     <ListItem>Decreased level of consciousness (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale score of –2 or lower).</ListItem><ListItem>Decreased performance status (Palliative Performance Scale score ≤20%).</ListItem><ListItem>Dysphagia of liquids.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_291">The late signs occurred mostly in the last 3 days of life, had lower frequency, and were highly specific for impending death in 3 days. Late signs included the following:<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_341" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Pulselessness on the radial artery.</ListItem><ListItem>Respiration with mandibular movement.</ListItem><ListItem>Decreased urine output.</ListItem><ListItem>Cheyne-Stokes breathing.</ListItem><ListItem> Death rattle.</ListItem><ListItem>Apnea periods.</ListItem><ListItem>Peripheral cyanosis.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_294">In particular, the high positive likelihood ratios (LRs) of pulselessness on the radial artery (positive LR, 15.6), respiration with mandibular movement (positive LR, 10), decreased urine output (≤200 cc/d) (positive LR, 15.2), Cheyne-Stokes breathing (positive LR, 12.4), and death rattle (positive LR, 9) suggest that these physical signs can be  useful for the diagnosis of impending death.<Reference refidx="6"/> Because of low sensitivity, the absence of these signs cannot rule out impending death.</Para><Para id="_342">Several other late signs that have been found to be useful for the diagnosis of impending death include the following:<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_295" Style="bullet" Compact="No">
     <ListItem> Nonreactive pupils (positive LR, 16.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 14.9–18.6).</ListItem><ListItem>Decreased response to verbal stimuli (positive LR, 8.3; 95% CI, 7.7–9).</ListItem><ListItem>Decreased response to visual stimuli (positive LR, 6.7; 95% CI, 6.3–7.1).</ListItem><ListItem>Inability to close eyelids (positive LR, 13.6; 95% CI, 11.7–15.5).</ListItem><ListItem>Drooping of the nasolabial fold (positive LR, 8.3; 95% CI, 7.7–8.9).</ListItem><ListItem>Hyperextension of the neck (positive LR, 7.3; 95% CI, 6.7–8).</ListItem><ListItem> Grunting of vocal cords (positive LR, 11.8; 95% CI, 10.3–13.4).</ListItem><ListItem>Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (positive LR, 10.3; 95% CI, 9.5–11.1).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_296">In conclusion, bedside physical signs may be useful in helping clinicians diagnose impending death with greater confidence, which can, in turn, assist in clinical decision making and communication with families.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_297"><Title>Care During the Final Hours of Life</Title><Para id="_298">The recognition of impending death is also an opportunity to encourage family members to notify individuals close to the patient who may want an opportunity to “say good-bye.”  In the final hours of life, care should be directed toward the patient and the patient’s loved ones.  In addition to continuing a careful and thoughtful approach to any symptoms a patient is experiencing (refer to the  <SummaryRef href="CDR0000543592#_7" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/caregivers/planning/last-days-hp-pdq">Symptoms During the Final Months, Weeks, and Days of Life</SummaryRef> section of this summary), preparing family and friends for a patient’s death is critical.  Preparations include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_305" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Acknowledging the symptoms that are likely to occur.</ListItem><ListItem>Articulating a plan to respond to the symptoms.</ListItem><ListItem>Eliciting fears or concerns of family members.</ListItem><ListItem>Assuring that respectfully allowing life to end is appropriate at this point in the patient’s life.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_306">Encouraging family members who desire to “do something” to participate in the care of the patient (e.g., moistening the mouth) may be helpful. In the final days to hours of life, patients often have limited, transitory moments of lucidity.  Family members should be prepared for this and educated that this is a natural aspect of the dying process and not necessarily a result of medications being administered for symptoms or a sign that the patient is doing better than predicted. Despite their limited ability to interact, patients may be aware of the presence of others; thus, loved ones can be encouraged to speak to the patient as if he or she can hear them.</Para><Para id="_299">Educating family members about certain signs is critical. In the final hours of life, patients often experience a decreased desire to eat or drink, as evidenced by clenched teeth or turning from offered food and fluids. This behavior may be difficult for family members to accept because of the meaning of food in our society and the inference that the patient is “starving.” Family members should be advised that forcing food or fluids can lead to aspiration. Reframing will include teaching the family to provide ice chips or a moistened oral applicator to keep a patient’s mouth and lips moist. Finally, the death rattle is particularly distressing to family members. (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000543592#_363" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/caregivers/planning/last-days-hp-pdq">Death Rattle</SummaryRef> section in the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000543592#_7" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/caregivers/planning/last-days-hp-pdq">Symptoms During the Final Months, Weeks, and Days of Life</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information.) It is important to assure family members that death rattle is a natural phenomenon and to pay careful attention to repositioning the patient and explain why tracheal suctioning is not warranted.<Reference refidx="13"/></Para><Para id="_300">For patients who die in the hospital, clinicians need to be prepared to inquire about the family’s desire for an autopsy, offering reassurance that the body will be treated with respect and that open-casket services are still possible, if desired.</Para><Para id="_301">Health care professionals, preferably in consultation with a chaplain or religious leader designated by the patient and/or family,  need to explore with families any fears associated with the time of death and any cultural or religious rituals that may be important to them. Such rituals might include placement of the body (e.g., the head of the bed facing Mecca for an Islamic patient) or having only same-sex caregivers or family members wash the body (as practiced in many orthodox religions).  When death occurs, expressions of grief by those at the bedside vary greatly, dictated in part by culture and in part by their preparation for the death. Chaplains are to be consulted as early as possible if the family accepts this assistance. Health care providers can offer to assist families in contacting loved ones and making other arrangements, including contacting a funeral home.

However, when the results of published studies of symptoms experienced by patients with advanced cancer are being interpreted or compared, the following methodological issues need to be considered:<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_308" Style="bullet" Compact="No">
     <ListItem>Variation in the instrument used to assess symptoms and/or severity of symptoms.</ListItem><ListItem>Variation in the timing of symptom assessment and whether the assessments were repeated over time.</ListItem><ListItem>Population studied in terms of specific cancers, or a less specified population of people with cancer.</ListItem><ListItem>Whether patients were recruited in the outpatient or inpatient setting.</ListItem><ListItem>Whether specialized palliative care services were available.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_309">Results of one of the larger and more comprehensive studies of symptoms in ambulatory patients with advanced cancer have been reported.<Reference refidx="2"/> Ambulatory patients with advanced cancer were included in the study if they had completed at least one Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) in the 6 months before death. The ESAS is a patient-completed measure of the severity of nine symptoms (anxiety, lack of appetite, depression, drowsiness, nausea, pain, shortness of breath, tiredness, and well-being). Analysis of the changes in the mean symptom intensity of 10,752 patients (and involving 56,759 assessments) over time revealed two patterns:<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_343" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>The mean scores for pain, nausea, anxiety, and depression remained relatively stable over the 6 months before death.</ListItem><ListItem>Shortness of breath, drowsiness, well-being, lack of appetite, and tiredness increased in severity over time, particularly in the month before death.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_310">In terms of symptoms closer to the EOL, a prospective study documented the symptom profile in the last week of life among 203 cancer patients who died in acute palliative care units.<Reference refidx="3"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] The proportion of patients able to communicate decreased from 80% to 39% over the last 7 days of life.  ESAS anorexia, drowsiness, fatigue, poor well-being, and dyspnea increased in intensity closer to death. In contrast, ESAS depression decreased over time. Dysphagia of solids and liquids and urinary incontinence were also present in an increasing proportion of patients in the last few days of life.  Less common but equally troubling symptoms that may occur in the final hours include death rattle and hemorrhage.</Para><Para id="_311">The following sections summarize some of the common symptoms and potential approaches to ameliorating those symptoms, based on available evidence. A final note of caution is warranted. Symptoms often cluster, and the presence of a symptom should prompt consideration of other symptoms to avoid inadvertently worsening other symptoms in the cluster. For example, a systematic review of observational studies concluded that there were four common clusters of symptoms (anxiety-depression, nausea-vomiting, nausea-appetite loss, and fatigue-dyspnea-drowsiness-pain).<Reference refidx="4"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_180"><Title>Delirium</Title><Para id="_181">Terminal delirium occurs before death in 50% to 90% of patients.<Reference refidx="5"/> Most patients have hypoactive delirium, with a decreased level of consciousness. Agitation, hallucinations, and restlessness may occur in a small proportion of patients with hyperactive and/or mixed delirium. Delirium is associated with  shorter survival and complicates symptom assessment, communication, and decision making. Furthermore, it can be extremely distressing to caregivers and health professionals.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/> Risk factors associated with terminal delirium include hypoxic encephalopathy, metabolic factors, and lack of reversible factors such as psychoactive medications and dehydration.<Reference refidx="9"/> Safety measures include protecting patients from accidents or self-injury while they are restless or agitated. The use of restraints should be minimized. Reorientation strategies are of little use during the final hours of life. Education and support for families witnessing a loved one’s delirium are warranted.</Para><Para id="_182">There are no randomized controlled trials on the management of delirium in patients with terminal delirium.<Reference refidx="10"/> (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062772" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/memory/delirium-hp-pdq">Delirium</SummaryRef> for a complete review.) Care of the patient with delirium can include stopping unnecessary medications, reversing metabolic abnormalities (if consistent with the goals of care), treating the symptoms of delirium, and providing a safe environment. Agents known to cause delirium include corticosteroids, chemotherapeutic agents, biological response modifiers, opioids, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and anticholinergic agents. In a small, open-label, prospective trial of 20 cancer patients who developed delirium while being treated with morphine, rotation to fentanyl reduced delirium and improved pain control in 18 patients.<Reference refidx="11"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_183">Onset of effect and nonoral modes of delivery are considered when an agent is being selected to treat delirium at the EOL. Agents that can be used to manage delirium  include haloperidol, 1 mg to 4 mg orally, intravenously, or subcutaneously.<Reference refidx="12"/> The dose is usually repeated every 4 to 6 hours but in severe cases can be administered every hour. Chlorpromazine can be used, but intravenous administration can lead to severe hypotension; therefore, it should be used cautiously.<Reference refidx="13"/> Other agents that may be effective include olanzapine, 2.5 mg to 20 mg orally at night (available in an orally disintegrating tablet for patients who cannot swallow);<Reference refidx="14"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] quetiapine;<Reference refidx="15"/> and risperidone (0.5–2 mg).<Reference refidx="16"/> While no randomized clinical trial demonstrates superiority of any agent over haloperidol, small (underpowered) studies suggest that olanzapine may be comparable to haloperidol. Finally,  although benzodiazepines (such as lorazepam) or atypical antipsychotics typically exacerbate delirium, they may be useful in delirium related to alcohol withdrawal and for hyperactive delirium that is not controlled by antipsychotics and other supportive measures. In intractable cases of delirium, palliative sedation may be warranted.</Para><Para id="_185">In dying patients, a poorly understood phenomenon that appears to be distinct from delirium is the experience of auditory and/or visual hallucinations that include loved ones who have already died (also known as EOL experience). Although patients may sometimes find these hallucinations comforting, fear of being labeled confused may prevent patients from sharing their experiences with health care professionals.<Reference refidx="17"/> Family members at the bedside may find these hallucinations disconcerting and will require support and reassurance. Consultation with the patient’s or family’s religious or spiritual advisor or the hospital chaplain is often beneficial.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_345"><Title>Fatigue</Title><Para id="_346">Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms at the EOL and often increases in prevalence and intensity as patients approach the final days of life.<Reference refidx="18"/> Fatigue at the EOL is multidimensional, and its underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood.<Reference refidx="19"/> It may be associated with drowsiness, weakness, and sleep disturbance. Scores on the Palliative Performance Scale also decrease rapidly during the last 7 days of life.<Reference refidx="20"/>  No clinical trials have been conducted in patients with only days of life expectancy.  Methylphenidate may be useful in selected patients with weeks of life expectancy.<Reference refidx="21"/> (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062734" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/fatigue/fatigue-hp-pdq">Fatigue</SummaryRef> for more information.)</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_347"><Title>Dyspnea</Title><Para id="_348">Dyspnea, described as shortness of breath or air hunger, is one of the most distressing symptoms for patients and often increases as patients approach the last weeks and days of life.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="22"/> The prevalence of dyspnea in adults diagnosed with cancer varies from 21% to 90%, correlated with lung cancer and advanced disease.<Reference refidx="23"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] Dyspnea may predict shortened survival.</Para><Para id="_349">The etiology of dyspnea is usually advanced malignant disease, although other risk factors include ascites, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, deconditioning, and pneumonia.  Dyspnea occurs when more respiratory effort is necessary to overcome obstruction or restrictive disease (e.g., tumor or pleural effusions), when more respiratory muscles are required to maintain adequate breathing (e.g., neuromuscular weakness or cachexia), or when there is an increase in ventilatory need (e.g., hypercapnia or metabolic acidosis).<Reference refidx="24"/> Aggressive interventions such as thoracentesis to treat potentially reversible causes may or may not be appropriate; patients’ prognosis, goals of care, and logistics are first to be taken into account.</Para><Para id="_350">In the last days of life, many patients may be confused, making assessment of dyspnea more challenging.  Objective measures such as respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and use of accessory muscles have limited association with patients’ subjective sensation of dyspnea.<Reference refidx="23"/> Caregivers may be able to provide a surrogate response.<Reference refidx="25"/> The Respiratory Distress Observation Scale  was developed for patients who could not self-report; however, correlation with patient’s expression of dyspnea was weak to moderate.<Reference refidx="26"/></Para><Para id="_351">The principles and practices for palliation of dyspnea in patients with days of survival are similar to those for patients with longer life expectancies.  Opioids, given orally, intravenously, or subcutaneously, are considered to be the first-line option.<Reference refidx="27"/>  Patients with evidence of bronchoconstriction may be given bronchodilators.</Para><Para id="_352">Corticosteroids may be considered for patients without clear contraindications.  Patients with hypoxemia would benefit from supplemental oxygen use. Patients with severe dyspnea and hypoxemic/hypercapnic respiratory failure may require bilevel positive airway pressure and/or high-flow oxygen, which represent noninvasive alternatives to intubation and mechanical ventilation.<Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/> Antibiotics may provide relief from infectious sources of dyspnea; however, the use of these agents should be consistent with a patient’s goals of care. If a patient experiences bronchospasm in conjunction with dyspnea, glucocorticoids or bronchodilators can provide relief. Bronchodilators are used with caution because they can increase anxiety, leading to a worsened sense of dyspnea.</Para><Para id="_382">In rare situations, dyspnea may be refractory to all of the treatments described above. In such cases, palliative sedation may be indicated, using benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or neuroleptics. Indeed, refractory dyspnea is the second most common indication for palliative sedation, after agitated delirium.<Reference refidx="30"/> (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000543592#_232" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/caregivers/planning/last-days-hp-pdq">Palliative Sedation</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information.)</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_9"><Title>Pain</Title><Para id="_10">The prevalence of pain is between 30% and 75% in the last days of life.<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="31"/> The assessment of pain may be complicated by delirium. Many patients fear uncontrolled pain during the final days of life, but experience suggests that most patients can obtain pain relief and that very high doses of opioids are rarely indicated.<Reference refidx="32"/> Indeed, the average intensity of pain often decreases as patients approach the final days.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_173">Some patients, family members, and health care professionals express concern that opioid use may hasten death. Several studies refute the fear of hastened death associated with opioid use.

Because consciousness may diminish during this time and swallowing becomes difficult, practitioners need to anticipate alternatives to the oral route. In one study, as patients approached death, the use of intermittent subcutaneous injections and intravenous or subcutaneous infusions increased.<Reference refidx="36"/> Both intravenous and subcutaneous routes are effective in delivering opioids and other agents in the inpatient or home setting. For patients who do not have a preexisting access port or catheter, intermittent or continuous subcutaneous administration provides a painless and effective route of delivery.<Reference refidx="37"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_353"><Title>Cough</Title><Para id="_354">Cough is a relatively common symptom in patients with advanced cancer near the EOL. In one small study, 33% of patients with advanced cancer who were enrolled in hospice and who completed the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale reported cough as a troubling symptom.<Reference refidx="38"/> This compares to a prevalence of lack of energy (68%), pain (63%), and dyspnea (60%). The treatment of troublesome coughing in patients in the final weeks to days of life is largely empiric, although diagnostic imaging or evaluation may occasionally be of value. In another study of patients with advanced cancer admitted to acute palliative care units, the prevalence of cough ranged from 10% to 30% in the last week of life.<Reference refidx="3"/> (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000352186" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/cardiopulmonary-hp-pdq">Cardiopulmonary Syndromes</SummaryRef> for more information about common causes of cough for which evaluation and targeted intervention may be indicated.) However, simple investigations such as reviewing medications or eliciting a history of symptoms compatible with gastroesophageal reflux disease are warranted because some drugs (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) cause cough, or a prescription for antacids may provide relief. In addition, patients may have comorbid conditions that contribute to coughing.</Para><Para id="_355">The cough reflex protects the lungs from noxious materials and clears excess secretions. The reflex is initiated by stimulation of peripheral cough receptors, which are transmitted to the brainstem by the vagus nerve. Activation of the central “cough center” mechanism causes a deep inspiration, followed by expiration against a closed glottis; then the glottis opens, allowing expulsion of the air.<Reference refidx="39"/> The empiric approach to cough may be organized as follows:</Para><ItemizedList id="_356" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem><Strong>Expectorants</Strong> increase bronchial fluids and reduce the viscosity of secretions, which improves the likelihood of successfully clearing the material.

Thus, the family will benefit from learning about the nature of this symptom and that  death rattle is not associated with  dyspnea.</Para><Para id="_365">Rattle is an indicator of impending death, with an incidence of approximately 50% to 60% in the last days of life and a median onset of 16 to 57 hours before death.<Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="42"/><Reference refidx="43"/> Two types of rattle have been identified:<Reference refidx="44"/><Reference refidx="45"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_368" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Real death rattle, or type 1, which is probably caused by salivary secretions.</ListItem><ListItem>Pseudo death rattle, or type 2, which is probably caused by deeper bronchial secretions due to infection, tumor, fluid retention, or aspiration.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_369">In one retrospective chart review, rattle was relieved in more than 90% of patients with salivary secretions, while patients with secretions of pulmonary origin were much less likely to respond to treatment.<Reference refidx="45"/></Para><Para id="_366">The results of clinical trials examining various pharmacologic agents for the treatment of death rattle have so far been negative.<Reference refidx="46"/> A small, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial that compared scopolamine to normal saline found no statistical significance.<Reference refidx="47"/> Another randomized study revealed no difference between atropine and placebo.<Reference refidx="48"/>  Results of other randomized controlled studies that examined octreotide,<Reference refidx="49"/> glycopyrrolate,<Reference refidx="50"/> and hyoscine butylbromide <Reference refidx="51"/> versus scopolamine were also negative.</Para><Para id="_367">Despite the lack of clear evidence, pharmacologic therapies are used frequently in clinical practice.<Reference refidx="52"/><Reference refidx="53"/>   Among the options described above, glycopyrrolate may be preferred because it is less likely to penetrate the central nervous system, and fewer adverse effects are reported with glycopyrrolate than with other antimuscarinic agents, which could worsen delirium.  Glycopyrrolate  is available parenterally and in oral tablet form. Doses typically range from 1 mg to 2 mg orally or 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg intravenously or subcutaneously every 4 hours, or by continuous intravenous infusion at a rate of 0.4 mg to 1.2 mg per day. Repositioning may be helpful.  Suctioning of excessive secretions may be considered for some patients.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_194"><Title>Myoclonus</Title><Para id="_312">Health care professionals need to monitor patients for opioid-induced neurotoxicity, which could cause myoclonus, hallucinations, and confusion and may mimic terminal delirium. When opioid-induced neurotoxicity is suspected, opioid rotation may be considered.<Reference refidx="11"/> Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are often contraindicated in these patients because of the risk of bleeding and renal failure.</Para><Para id="_195">Myoclonus is defined as sudden and involuntary movements caused by focal or generalized muscle contractions. The duration of contractions is brief and may be described as shocklike. There are many potential causes of myoclonus, most of which probably stem from the metabolic derangements anticipated as life ends. Medications are an important etiology, especially because many medications may be discontinued. Opioids are probably the most common medication-related cause of myoclonus. The reported prevalence of opioid-induced myoclonus ranges greatly, from 2.7% to 87%.<Reference refidx="54"/></Para><Para id="_264"> When opioids are implicated in the development of myoclonus, rotation to a different opioid is the primary treatment. In patients with rapidly impending death, the health care provider may choose to treat the myoclonus rather than make changes in opioids during the final hours.

An important strategy to achieve that goal is to avoid or limit medical interventions of limited effectiveness and high burden to the patients. There is, however, a great deal of confusion, anxiety, and miscommunication around the question of whether to utilize potentially life-sustaining treatments (LSTs) such as mechanical ventilation, total parenteral nutrition, and dialysis in the final weeks or days of life.  To ensure that the best interests of the patient—as communicated by the patient, family, or surrogate decision maker—determine the decisions about LSTs, discussions can be organized around the following questions:</Para><ItemizedList id="_201" Style="bullet" Compact="No">
     <ListItem>What are the patient’s goals of care?</ListItem><ListItem>How do the potential benefits of LST contribute to achieving the goals of care, and how likely is the desired outcome?</ListItem><ListItem>How do the potential harms of LST detract from the patient’s goals of care, and does the likelihood of achieving the desired outcome or the value the patient assigns to the outcome justify the risk of harm?</ListItem><ListItem>What considerations—other than the potential benefits and harms of LST—are relevant to the patient or surrogate decision maker?</ListItem><ListItem>What other resources—e.g., chaplain or  clinical ethicist—would help the patient or family with decisions about LST?</ListItem></ItemizedList><SummarySection id="_203"><Title>Ethical Perspectives</Title><Para id="_204">Medicine is a moral enterprise. The decisions clinicians make are often highly subjective and value laden but seem less so because, equally often, there is a shared sense of benefit, harm, and what is most highly valued. Occasionally, disagreements arise or a provider is uncertain about what is ethically permissible. For example, an oncologist may favor the discontinuation or avoidance of LST, given the lack of evidence of benefit or the possibility of harm—including increasing the suffering of the dying person by prolonging the dying process—or based on concerns that LST interferes with the patient accepting that life is ending and finding peace in the final days. A provider also may be uncertain about whether withdrawing treatment is equivalent to causing the patient’s death. Conversely, the patient may continue to request LST on the basis of personal beliefs and a preference for potential prolonged life, independent of the oncologist’s clinical risk-benefit analysis.</Para><Para id="_327">Individual values inform the moral landscape of the practice of medicine. The potential conflicts described above are opportunities to refine clinicians’ understanding of their beliefs and values and to communicate their moral reasoning to each other as a sign of integrity and respect.<Reference refidx="1"/>  As clinicians struggle to communicate their reasons for recommendations or actions, the following three questions may serve as a framework:<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_273" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Who makes the decision?</ListItem><ListItem>By what criteria do they make the decision? </ListItem><ListItem>How are conflicts among decision makers resolved?</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_328">In the event of conflict, an ethics consult may be necessary to identify the sources of disagreement and potential solutions, although frameworks have been proposed to guide the clinician.<Reference refidx="3"/> The following paragraphs summarize information relevant to the first two questions.</Para><Para id="_329">Respect for patient autonomy is an essential element of the relationship between oncology clinician and patient. Respect for autonomy encourages clinicians to elicit patients’ values, goals of care, and preferences and then seek to provide treatment or care recommendations consistent with patient preferences.<Reference refidx="4"/> Autonomy is primarily a negative right to be free from the interference of others or, in health care, to refuse a recommended treatment or intervention.<Reference refidx="5"/> On the basis of potential harm to others or deliberate harm to themselves, there are limits to what patients can expect in terms of their requests. More controversial limits are imposed when oncology clinicians feel they are asked to violate their ethical integrity or when the medical effectiveness of a treatment does not justify the burden.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_330">Perceived conflicts about the issue of patient autonomy may be avoided by recalling that promoting patient autonomy is not only about treatments administered but also about discussions with the patient.<Reference refidx="4"/> It is acceptable for oncology clinicians to share the basis for their recommendations, including concerns such as clinician-perceived futility.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_331">The following criteria to consider forgoing a potential LST are not absolute and remain a topic of discussion and debate; however, they offer a frame of reference for deliberation:</Para><ItemizedList id="_332" Style="bullet" Compact="No">
     <ListItem>The possibility of forgoing a potential LST is worth considering when either the clinician perceives that the medical effectiveness of an intervention is not justified by the medical risks or the patient perceives that the benefit (a more subjective appraisal) is not consistent with the burden.</ListItem><ListItem>The goal of forgoing a potential LST is to relieve suffering as experienced by the patient and not to cause the death of the patient.<Reference refidx="8"/> Measures that deliberately seek to end the life of the patient are more problematic.</ListItem><ListItem>There is probably no difference between withholding or withdrawing a potential LST because the goal in both cases  is to relieve or avoid further suffering.<Reference refidx="9"/></ListItem><ListItem>The burden and suffering associated with medical interventions from the patient’s perspective are the most important criteria for forgoing a potential LST.

When the investigators stratified patients into two groups—those who received at least 1 L of parenteral hydration per day and those who received less than 1 L/day—the prevalence of bronchial secretions was higher and hyperactive delirium was lower in the patients who received less than 1 L.<Reference refidx="20"/></Para><Para id="_209">Any discussion about the risks or benefits of artificial hydration must include a consideration of patient and family perspectives.<Reference refidx="21"/> Requests for artificial hydration or the desire for discussions about the role of artificial hydration seem to be driven by quality-of-life considerations as much as considerations for life prolongation.<Reference refidx="22"/>  Families may be helped with this decision when clinicians explain that use of artificial hydration in patients with cancer at the EOL has not been shown to help patients live longer or improve quality of life.

It is important for patients, families, and proxies to understand that choices may be made to specify which supportive measures, if any, are given preceding death and at the time of death. People often believe that there is plenty of time to discuss resuscitation and the surrounding issues; however, many dying patients do not make choices in advance or have not communicated their decisions to their families, proxies, and the health care team. If these issues are unresolved at the time of EOL events, undesired support and resuscitation may result. Studies suggest that this aggressive care is associated with worse patient quality of life and worse adjustment to bereavement  for loved ones.<Reference refidx="42"/><Reference refidx="43"/></Para><Para id="_220">Narrowly defined, a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order instructs health care providers that, in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR, including chest compressions and/or ventilations) should not be performed and that natural death be allowed to proceed. DNR orders must be made before cardiac arrest and may be recommended by physicians when CPR is considered medically futile or would be ineffective in returning a patient to life. A DNR order may also be made at the instruction of the patient (or family or proxy) when CPR is not consistent with the goals of care.</Para><Para id="_380">It is advisable for a patient who has clear thoughts about these issues to initiate conversations with the health care team (or appointed health care agents in the outpatient setting) and to have forms completed as early as possible (i.e., before hospital admission), before the capacity to make such decisions is lost. Although patients with end-stage disease and their families are often uncomfortable bringing up the issues surrounding DNR orders, physicians and nurses can tactfully and respectfully address these issues appropriately and in a timely fashion. Lack of standardization in many institutions may contribute to ineffective and unclear discussions around DNR orders.<Reference refidx="44"/></Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="24851512">Kaldjian LC: Communicating moral reasoning in medicine as an expression of respect for patients and integrity among professionals.

This complicates EOL decision making because the treatments may prolong life, or at least are perceived as accomplishing that goal. At that point, patients or families may express ambivalence or be reluctant to withdraw treatments rather than withhold them.</Para><Para id="_383">One strategy to explore is preventing further escalation of care. The goal of this strategy is to provide a bridge between full life-sustaining treatment (LST) and comfort care, in which the goal is a good death.  One study <Reference refidx="1"/> described the care of 310 patients who died in the intensive care unit (ICU) (not all of whom had cancer). For 95 patients (30%), there was a decision not to escalate care. The average time from ICU admission to deciding not to escalate care was 6 days (range, 0–37), and the average time to death was 0.8 days (range, 0–5). The interventions most likely to be withheld were dialysis, vasopressors, and blood transfusions. Fifty-five percent of the patients eventually had all life support withdrawn. The transition to comfort care did not occur before death for  the other decedents for the following reasons: waiting for family to arrive, change of family opinion, or waiting for an ethics consultation.</Para><Para id="_339">Conversely, some situations may warrant exploring with the patient and/or family a time-limited trial of intensive medical treatments. It has been argued that clinicians may frame the decision to withdraw or not escalate care as missing the opportunity to die.<Reference refidx="2"/> It can be argued, however, that refusing unwanted mechanical ventilation is equivalent to refusing oral hydration or nutrition. Thus, the patient may choose to forgo all LST at any time.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_224"><Title>Withdrawal of Ventilatory Support</Title><Para id="_225">Two methods of withdrawal have been described: immediate extubation and terminal weaning.<Reference refidx="3"/> Immediate extubation includes providing parenteral opioids for analgesia and sedating agents such as midazolam, suctioning to remove excess secretions, setting the ventilator to “no assist” and turning off all alarms, and deflating the cuff and removing the endotracheal tube. Gentle suctioning of the oral cavity may be necessary, but aggressive and deep suctioning should be avoided. In some cases, patients may appear to be in significant distress. Analgesics and sedatives may be provided, even if the patient is comatose. Family members and others who are present should be warned that some movements may occur after extubation, even in patients who have no brain activity. Such movements are probably caused by hypoxia and may include gasping, moving extremities, or sitting up in bed.<Reference refidx="4"/> Immediate extubation is generally chosen when a patient has lost brain function, when a patient is comatose and unlikely to experience any suffering, or when a patient prefers a more rapid procedure.</Para><Para id="_226">Terminal weaning entails a more gradual process. Ventilator rate, oxygen levels, and positive end-expiratory pressure are decreased gradually over a period of 30 minutes to a few hours. A patient who survives may be placed on a T-piece; this may be left in place, or extubation may proceed. There is some evidence that the gradual process in a patient who may experience distress allows clinicians to assess pain and dyspnea and to modify the sedative and analgesic regimen accordingly.<Reference refidx="5"/> In a study of 31 patients undergoing terminal weaning, most patients remained comfortable, as assessed by a variety of physiologic measures, when low doses of opioids and benzodiazepines were administered. The average time to death in this study was 24 hours, although two patients survived to be discharged to hospice.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_227">Paralytic agents have no analgesic or sedative effects, and they can mask patient discomfort. These neuromuscular blockers need to be discontinued before extubation. Guidelines suggest that these agents should never be introduced when the ventilator is being withdrawn; in general, when patients have been receiving paralytic agents, these agents need to be withdrawn before extubation. The advantage of withdrawal of the neuromuscular blocker is the resultant ability of the health care provider to better assess the patient’s comfort level and to allow possible interaction between the patient and loved ones. One notable exception to withdrawal of the paralytic agent is when death is expected to be rapid after the removal of the ventilator and when waiting for the drug to reverse might place an unreasonable burden on the patient and family.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_228">Regardless of the technique employed, the patient and setting must be prepared. Monitors and alarms are turned off, and life-prolonging interventions such as antibiotics and transfusions need to be discontinued. Family members should be given sufficient time to make preparations, including making arrangements for the presence of all loved ones who wish to be in attendance. They need to be given information about what to expect during the process; some may elect to remain out of the room during extubation. Chaplains or social workers may be called to provide support to the family.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="23989181">Morgan CK, Varas GM, Pedroza C, et al.: Defining the practice of "no escalation of care" in the ICU.

In a survey of the attitudes and experiences of more than 1,000 U.S. physicians toward intentional sedation to unconsciousness until death revealed that 68% of respondents opposed palliative sedation for existential distress. Of note, only 10% of physician respondents had prescribed palliative sedation in the preceding 12 months.<Reference refidx="8"/> A previous survey conducted by the same research group reported that only 18% of surveyed physicians objected to “sedation to unconsciousness in dying patients” without a specified indication.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_236">One potential objection or concern related to palliative sedation for refractory existential or psychological distress is unrecognized but potentially remediable depression. (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000543592#_242" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/caregivers/planning/last-days-hp-pdq">Requests for Hastened Death</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more information.)</Para><Para id="_237">Further objections or concerns include (1) whether the principle of double effect, the ethical basis for the use of palliative sedation for refractory physical distress, is adequate justification; and (2) cultural expectations about psychological or existential suffering at the EOL. The principle of double effect is based on the concept of proportionality. It states that the intended effect of palliative sedation (relief of suffering) may justify the foreseeable but unintended consequence (shortening of life expectancy or loss of ability to interact with loved ones) if the intended (positive) outcome is of greater value than the unintended (negative) outcome.<Reference refidx="10"/> Thus, in the case of palliative sedation for refractory psychological or existential distress, the perception that palliative sedation is not justified may reflect a devaluation of the distress associated with such suffering or that other means with fewer  negative consequences have not been fully explored.</Para><Para id="_239"><Strong><Emphasis>Intended level of sedation:</Emphasis></Strong> Another decision is whether the intended level of sedation is unconsciousness or a level associated with relief of the distress attributed to physical or psychological symptoms. In a survey of U.S. physicians,<Reference refidx="8"/> two-thirds of respondents felt that unconsciousness was an acceptable unintended consequence of palliative sedation, but deliberate unconsciousness was unacceptable. This finding may relate to the sense of proportionality. A qualitative study of 54 physicians who had administered palliative sedation indicated that physicians who were more concerned with ensuring that suffering was relieved were more likely to administer palliative sedation to unconsciousness. Physicians who chose mild sedation were guided more by their assessment of the patient’s condition.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><Para id="_240"><Strong><Emphasis>Intended duration of sedation:</Emphasis></Strong> If the clinician anticipates that a distressing symptom will improve with time, then the  clinician should discuss with the patient any recommendations about a deliberate reduction in level of consciousness to assess symptom distress. In the published experience cited earlier,<Reference refidx="7"/> palliative sedation for delirium or dyspnea was reversible in 23% of patients admitted to a palliative care unit.</Para><Para id="_241"><Strong><Emphasis>Role of potentially LSTs during palliative sedation:</Emphasis></Strong> The intent of palliative sedation is to relieve suffering; it is not to shorten life. The decision to discontinue or maintain treatments such as artificial hydration or nutrition requires a review of the patient’s goals of care and the potential for benefit or harm. In general, the absence of evidence for benefit seems to justify recommendations to forgo LSTs in the context of palliative sedation. On the other hand, open lines of communication and a respectful and responsive awareness of a patient’s preferences are important to maintain during the dying process, so the clinician should not overstate the potential risks of hydration or nutrition. There is consensus that decisions about LSTs are  distinct from the decision to administer palliative sedation.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_242"><Title>Requests for Hastened Death</Title><Para id="_243"><Strong><Emphasis>Potential reasons for requests:</Emphasis></Strong> Requests for hastened death or statements that express a desire to die vary from expression of a temporary or passive wish to a sustained interest in interventions to  end life or a statement of intent to plan or commit suicide.<Reference refidx="12"/> Reliable data on the frequency of requests for hastened death are not available.</Para><Para id="_244">Requests for hastened death provide the oncology clinician with an opportunity to explore and respond to the dying patient’s experience in an attentive and compassionate manner. From the patient’s perspective, the reasons for requests for hastened death are multiple and complex and include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_245" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Depression or a sense of hopelessness.<Reference refidx="13"/></ListItem><ListItem>Uncontrollable pain or other physical symptoms, with decreased quality of life.<Reference refidx="14"/></ListItem><ListItem>Loss of personal identity and social relations.<Reference refidx="15"/></ListItem><ListItem>To avoid being a burden to others.<Reference refidx="16"/></ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_246">The cited studies summarize the patient’s perspectives. Surveys of health care providers demonstrate similar findings and reasons.</Para><Para id="_247"><Strong><Emphasis>Responding to requests:</Emphasis></Strong> Recommendations are based on principles of counseling and expert opinion. Specific studies are not available. The first and most important consideration is for health care providers to maintain awareness of their personal reactions to requests or statements. It is imperative that the oncology clinician expresses a supportive and accepting attitude. Providers who are too uncomfortable to engage in a discussion need  to explain to a patient the need for a referral to another provider for assistance.<Reference refidx="17"/> Other prudent advice includes the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_248" Style="bullet">

If left unattended, loss, grief, and bereavement can become complicated, leading to prolonged and significant distress for either family members or clinicians. Furthermore, clinicians are at risk for significant grief from the cumulative effects of many losses through the deaths of their patients. Burnout has also been associated with unresolved grief in health care professionals.
