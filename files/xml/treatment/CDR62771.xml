The term epithelial ovarian cancer encompasses a heterogeneous group of tumors.  Classically, ovarian tumors have been classified as serous, mucinous, endometrioid, and clear cell.  However, a dual classification system of type I and type II tumors has been proposed that incorporates molecular profiling of tumors as well as histology and clinical behavior.<Reference refidx="7"/> Type I tumors usually present at a low stage, are associated with an excellent clinical prognosis, and encompass borderline malignant tumors. Type II tumors are more aggressive, usually present in an advanced stage, and have a variety of histologies.  Type I tumors tend to be more stable genetically than type II tumors, with type II tumors also having a high prevalence of <GeneName>TP53</GeneName> mutations.   About 75% of epithelial cancers are type II tumors and include ovarian cancer such as serous, endometrioid, and mixed mesodermal tumors.  There is increasing evidence that the two types of cancers are different genetically, and thus, may have different molecular pathways of development.  Evidence also suggests that both of these types develop outside the ovary and then secondarily involve the ovary, with most type II tumors being of tubal origin.<Reference refidx="7"/> This is hypothesized to be the case for both genetic  cancers (<GeneName>BRCA1/2</GeneName>-mutation associated cancers) and most noninherited forms of ovarian cancer.</Para><Para id="_140">The heterogeneity of ovarian cancer and the suggestion of different molecular pathways of origin for cancer subtypes present challenges and opportunities for the conduct and interpretation of etiologic factors associated with the development of ovarian cancer.  Etiologic association may vary by the mix of subtypes in the populations included in the epidemiologic studies.  Ovarian cancer is a rare cancer, thus sample size and power of studies to detect moderate association by subtype of cancer are limited.  However, clearer subtyping of cancers may assist is improving our understanding of the etiology of ovarian malignancies in future studies.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_141"><Title>Inherited Susceptibility to Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer </Title><Para id="_142">Some women are at an increased risk because of an inherited susceptibility to ovarian cancer, with the magnitude of that risk depending on the affected gene and specific mutation.

Tea consumption was not specifically addressed in that review, but another systematic review included 16 articles, with nine articles reporting no association with tea consumption, five reporting  a decreased risk, and one each reporting a borderline decreased and increased risk associated with tea consumption.<Reference refidx="28"/>	A case-control study conducted in southern China (500 cases and 500 controls), published subsequent to the review, reported a protective association between regular drinking of green tea, black tea, and/or oolong tea, with an OR of 0.29 (95% CI, 0.22–0.39).<Reference refidx="29"/></Para><Para id="_187">Circulating vitamin D levels and the association with ovarian cancer was examined in a nested case-control study (516 cases and 770 matched controls) conducted among seven prospective cohorts.<Reference refidx="30"/> No association was observed between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and the development of ovarian cancer.

Among this group, 429 cases of ovarian cancer occurred.  Powder use on genitals, sanitary napkins, and diaphragms was examined individually and as a combined exposure.  Women were followed for a mean of 12.4 years. No association of ovarian cancer was observed with ever-use of perineal powder compared with never-use  when analyzed either by individual method of exposure or by overall combined exposure.

A major limitation was that only one of the cohort studies included in the meta-analysis had a follow-up period longer than 10 years for those exposed to IVF.</Para><Para id="_149">A Cochrane systematic review included 11 case-control studies and 14 cohort studies, for  a total of 186,972 women; however, summary statistics were not calculated because of methodological and clinical heterogeneity.   Among seven cohort studies that compared treated women with untreated subfertile women, no excess risk was noted in association with hyperstimulation medications.  Two cohorts noted an increased risk of twofold to fivefold when treated women were compared with the general population.  An increased risk of borderline ovarian tumors was noted in three case-control studies and two cohort studies.  Overall, the authors concluded there was no convincing evidence that an increased risk of invasive ovarian tumors was associated with fertility drug treatments, but  there may be an increased risk of borderline ovarian tumors.<Reference refidx="42"/></Para><Para id="_150">A follow-up study of an infertility cohort <Reference refidx="43"/> was published subsequent to the aforementioned Cochrane review.  A retrospective cohort of 9,825 women enrolled between 1965 and 1988 was followed through 2010.  Ovarian cancer occurred in 85 women.  Overall, there was no association between ovarian cancer and clomiphene citrate  (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.86–2.07) or gonadotropins (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.48–2.08).  Among the subgroup of women who remained nulligravid after treatment, an increased risk of ovarian cancer was associated with clomiphene citrate (RR, 3.63; 95% CI, 1.36–9.72); no increased risk was observed among women who successfully  conceived after being treated, compared with women who were  not treated. </Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">American Cancer Society: Cancer Facts and Figures 2015.
