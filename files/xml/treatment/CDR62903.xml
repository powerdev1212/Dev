          Irregular vaginal bleeding is an early sign, the   foremost symptom, and  the reason why the majority of patients with the highly curable endometrial tumor are diagnosed with stage I disease. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_248"><Title>Risk Factors</Title><Para id="_266">
          
          Risk factors for the development of endometrial cancer include the following: </Para><ItemizedList id="_267" Style="bullet">
     <ListItem>Obesity.</ListItem><ListItem>Hypertension.</ListItem><ListItem>Diabetes mellitus.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_284">Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in patients diagnosed with endometrial cancer because of the early stage of the cancer at diagnosis and the metabolic risk factors.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_250"><Title>Diagnostics</Title><Para id="_3">  To
detect endometrial cancer, a technique that directly samples the endometrial
tissue is mandatory.  The Pap smear is not reliable as a screening procedure in
endometrial cancer, although a retrospective study found a strong correlation
between positive cervical cytology and high-risk disease (i.e., high-grade
tumor and deep myometrial invasion) <Reference refidx="3"/> as well as an increased risk of nodal
disease.<Reference refidx="4"/>  The degree of tumor differentiation has an important impact on the
natural history of this disease and on treatment selection.  An increased
incidence of endometrial cancer has been found in association with prolonged,
unopposed estrogen exposure.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>  In contrast, combined estrogen and
progesterone therapy prevents the increase in risk of endometrial cancer
associated with unopposed estrogen use.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/>  In some patients, an antecedent
history of complex hyperplasia with atypia can be demonstrated.  An increased
incidence of endometrial cancer has also been found in association with
tamoxifen treatment of breast cancer  (NSABP-B-14), related to the estrogenic effect
of tamoxifen on the endometrium.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/>  Because of this increase, patients on
tamoxifen should have follow-up pelvic examinations and should be examined if
there is any abnormal uterine bleeding.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_251"><Title>Histopathology</Title><Para id="_183">The pattern of spread is partially dependent on the degree of cellular
differentiation.  Well-differentiated tumors tend to limit their spread to the
surface of the endometrium; myometrial extension is less common.  In patients
with poorly differentiated tumors, myometrial invasion occurs much more
frequently.  Myometrial invasion is frequently a harbinger of lymph node
involvement and distant metastases and is often independent of the degree of
differentiation.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/>  Metastatic spread occurs in a characteristic pattern. 
Spread to the pelvic and para-aortic nodes is common.  When distant metastasis occurs, it  most commonly involves the following: </Para><ItemizedList id="_184" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Lungs.</ListItem><ListItem>Inguinal and supraclavicular nodes.</ListItem><ListItem>Liver.</ListItem><ListItem>Bones.</ListItem><ListItem>Brain.</ListItem><ListItem>Vagina.</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_252"><Title>Prognostic Factors</Title><Para id="_186">Another factor found to correlate with extrauterine and nodal spread of tumor
is involvement of the capillary-lymphatic space on histopathologic
examination.<Reference refidx="13"/>  Three prognostic groupings of clinical stage I disease become
possible by careful operative staging.  Patients with grade 1 tumors involving
only endometrium and no evidence of intraperitoneal disease (i.e., adnexal
spread) have a low risk (&lt;5%) of nodal involvement.<Reference refidx="14"/> 
Patients with grade 2 or 3 tumors and invasion of less than 50% of the
myometrium and no intraperitoneal disease have a 5% to 9% incidence of pelvic
node involvement and a 4% incidence of positive para-aortic nodes.  Patients
with deep muscle invasion and high-grade tumors and/or intraperitoneal disease
have a significant risk of nodal spread, 20% to 60% to pelvic nodes and 10% to
30% to para-aortic nodes.  One study was directed specifically at stage I,
grade 1 carcinomas of favorable histologic type.  The authors identified  the following four
statistically significant adverse prognostic factors:<Reference refidx="15"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_187" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Myometrial invasion.</ListItem><ListItem>Vascular invasion.</ListItem><ListItem>Eight or more mitoses per ten high-power fields.</ListItem><ListItem>An absence
of progesterone receptors.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_6">Another group identified aneuploidy and a high S-phase fraction as predictive
of poor prognosis.<Reference refidx="16"/>  A Gynecologic Oncology Group study related
surgical-pathologic parameters and postoperative treatment to recurrence-free
interval and recurrence site.  For patients without extrauterine spread, the
greatest determinants of recurrence were grade 3 histology and deep myometrial
invasion.  In this study, the frequency of recurrence was greatly increased
with positive pelvic nodes, adnexal metastasis, positive peritoneal cytology,
capillary space involvement, involvement of the isthmus or cervix, and,
particularly, positive para-aortic nodes (includes all grades and depth of
invasion).  Of the cases with aortic node metastases, 98% were
in patients with positive pelvic nodes, intra-abdominal metastases, or tumor
invasion of the outer 33% of the myometrium.<Reference refidx="17"/><Reference refidx="18"/>
</Para><Para id="_7">When the only evidence of extrauterine spread is positive peritoneal cytology,
the influence on outcome is unclear.  The value of therapy directed at this
cytologic finding is not well founded.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/><Reference refidx="21"/><Reference refidx="22"/><Reference refidx="23"/><Reference refidx="24"/>  As a result, although the collection of cytology specimens  is still suggested, a positive result does not upstage the cancer.  Other extrauterine disease must be present before
additional postoperative therapy is considered.
</Para><Para id="_198">One report found progesterone receptor levels to be the single most important
prognostic indicator of 3-year survival in clinical stage I and II disease. 
Patients with progesterone receptor levels higher than 100 had a 3-year
disease-free survival of 93% compared with 36% for a level lower than 100.  Only
cervical involvement and peritoneal cytology were significant prognostic
variables after adjusting for progesterone receptor levels.<Reference refidx="25"/>  Other reports
confirm the importance of hormone receptor status as an independent prognostic
factor.<Reference refidx="26"/>  Additionally, immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded
tissue for both estrogen and progesterone receptors has been shown to correlate
with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics  grade as well
as survival.<Reference refidx="27"/><Reference refidx="28"/><Reference refidx="29"/>  On the basis of these data, progesterone and estrogen
receptors, assessed either by biochemical or immunohistochemical methods,
should be included, when possible, in the evaluation of stage I and II
patients.  The following have also been found to be prognostic indicators of clinical outcome:<Reference refidx="29"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_189" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Oncogene expression.</ListItem><ListItem>DNA ploidy.</ListItem><ListItem>The fraction of cells in
S-phase.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_188">  For example, overexpression of the <ScientificName>Her-2/neu</ScientificName> oncogene has been

</Para><Para id="_56">In general, patients with stage III endometrial cancer are treated with surgery, followed by chemotherapy,   or radiation therapy, or both.
For many years, radiation therapy was the standard adjuvant treatment for patients with endometrial cancer.  However, several randomized trials have confirmed improved survival when adjuvant chemotherapy is used instead of radiation therapy.  In a trial conducted in a subset of patients with stage III or IV disease with residual tumors smaller  than 2 cm and no parenchymal organ involvement, the use of the combination of cisplatin and doxorubicin resulted in improved overall survival (OS) compared with whole-abdominal radiation therapy (adjusted hazard ratio,  0.68; 95% confidence interval limits, 0.52–0.89; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .02; 5-year survival rates of 55% vs. 42%).<Reference refidx="1"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335125">Level of evidence: 1iiA</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_211"> In a subsequent trial, paclitaxel with doxorubicin had an outcome similar to that of cisplatin with doxorubicin.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>  The three-drug regimen (doxorubicin, cisplatin, and paclitaxel) with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), however, was significantly superior to cisplatin plus doxorubicin:  response rates were 57% versus 34%; progression-free survival  was 8.3 months versus 5.3 months; and OS was 15.3 months versus 12.3 months, respectively.  The superior regimen was associated with a 12% grade 3 and a 27% grade 2 peripheral neuropathy.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000587983">Level of evidence: 1iiDiv</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_212">Given the toxicity and limited efficacy of these regimens, other treatment options have been widely sought.  Several observational  studies <Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/> and phase II studies <Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/> suggested clinical activity with the combination of platinums and paclitaxel in endometrial cancer patients with measurable disease either following primary surgery or at recurrence.

The interim results, currently available in abstract form, showing that carboplatin and paclitaxel is not inferior to TAP have lent credence to the use of carboplatin and paclitaxel as the standard for adjuvant treatment of stage III and IV disease.</Para><Para id="_213">Patients with inoperable disease caused by tumor that extends to the pelvic wall may be treated with a combination of chemotherapy and  radiation therapy.

disease and symptoms related to disease sites.  For bulky pelvic disease,
radiation therapy consisting of a combination of intracavitary and external-beam radiation therapy is used.  When distant metastases, especially pulmonary
metastases, are present, hormonal therapy is indicated and useful.
Observational studies support maximal cytoreductive surgery for patients with stage IV disease, although these conclusions need to be interpreted with care because of the small number of cases and likely selection bias.</Para><Para id="_231">When possible, patients with stage IV endometrial cancer are treated with surgery, followed by chemotherapy, or radiation therapy, or both. For many years, radiation therapy was the standard adjuvant treatment for patients with endometrial cancer.  However, several randomized trials have confirmed improved survival when adjuvant chemotherapy is used instead of radiation therapy.  In a trial conducted in a subset of patients with stage III or IV disease with residual tumors smaller  than 2 cm and no parenchymal organ involvement, the use of the combination of cisplatin and doxorubicin resulted in improved overall survival (OS) compared with whole-abdominal radiation therapy (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval limits, 0.52–0.89; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .02; 5-year survival rates of 55% vs. 42%).<Reference refidx="1"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335125">Level of evidence: 1iiA</LOERef>] </Para><Para id="_214">In a subsequent trial, paclitaxel with doxorubicin had an outcome similar to that of cisplatin with doxorubicin.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>  The three-drug regimen (doxorubicin, cisplatin, and paclitaxel) with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), however, was significantly superior to cisplatin plus doxorubicin:  response rates were 57% versus 34%; progression-free survival was 8.3 months versus 5.3 months; and OS was 15.3 months versus 12.3 months, respectively.  The superior regimen was associated with a 12% grade 3 and a 27% grade 2 peripheral neuropathy.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000587983">Level of evidence: 1iiDiv</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_215">Given the toxicity and limited efficacy of these regimens, other treatment options have been widely sought.  Several observational studies  <Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/> and phase II studies <Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/> suggested clinical activity with the combination of platinums and paclitaxel in endometrial cancer patients with measurable disease either following primary surgery or at recurrence.

The interim results, currently available in abstract form, showing  that carboplatin and paclitaxel is not inferior to TAP have lent credence to the use of carboplatin and paclitaxel as the standard for adjuvant treatment in stage III and IV disease.</Para><Para id="_62">The most common hormonal treatment has been progestational agents, which
produce good antitumor responses in as many as 15% to 30% of patients.  These
responses are associated with significant improvement in survival. 
Progesterone and estrogen hormone receptors have been identified in 
endometrial carcinoma tissues.  Responses to hormones are correlated with the
presence and level of hormone receptors and the degree of tumor
differentiation.  Standard progestational agents include hydroxyprogesterone, medroxyprogesterone, and megestrol.<Reference refidx="10"/>

metastases in selected sites, radiation therapy may be an effective palliative
therapy.  In rare instances, pelvic radiation therapy may be curative in pure vaginal
recurrence when no prior radiation therapy has been used.  Patients positive for
estrogen and progesterone receptors respond best to progestin therapy.  Among
115 patients with advanced endometrial cancer who were treated with progestins,
75% (42 of 56 patients) of those with detectable progesterone receptors in their tumors
before treatment responded, compared with only 7% without detectable progesterone
receptors (4 of 59 patients).<Reference refidx="1"/>  A receptor-poor status may predict not only poor
response to progestins but also a better response to cytotoxic
