    <Answer>
     <Para id="_6"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046149">Antineoplastons</GlossaryTermRef> are a group of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000643008">chemical</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000422394">compounds</GlossaryTermRef> that are found normally in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046642">urine</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000270735">blood</GlossaryTermRef>.  They are made up mostly of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000446104">amino acids</GlossaryTermRef> (the building blocks of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046092">protein</GlossaryTermRef>) and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045823">peptides</GlossaryTermRef> (compounds made  of two or more amino acids).

    <Question>What is the history of the discovery and use of antineoplastons as a complementary and alternative treatment for cancer?</Question>
    <Answer>
     <Para id="_8">Antineoplaston <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044737">therapy</GlossaryTermRef> was developed by Dr. S. R. Burzynski.   He proposed  that there must be a process in the body that controls how a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046476">cell</GlossaryTermRef> develops, and that this process fails when a cell divides endlessly and develops into a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumor</GlossaryTermRef>.   He suggested that certain natural substances, which he named "antineoplastons,"  switch an <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044636">abnormal</GlossaryTermRef> cell back onto the path of normal development.   Since peptides are considered to be the carriers of instructions in the body, he began looking for peptides that may be present in the blood of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef> patients. After comparing the blood of healthy people to the blood of people with cancer, Dr. Burzynski found that people with cancer have lower amounts of  a certain group of chemicals. He found these same chemicals in urine     and suggested that some of these chemicals can be used to stop certain cancer cells from dividing.</Para>
    <Para id="_32">Dr. Burzynski separated and removed several different types of antineoplastons from the urine of healthy people. He tested these antineoplastons on normal and abnormal  cells to see their effect and found that some types of  antineoplastons were more effective on more types of abnormal cells than others. He called this type antineoplaston A. He later developed and tested antineoplastons  A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5.   He found that A2 had the most effect on tumor cells and named the active ingredient in  it A10. Other antineoplastons followed. In 1976, Dr. Burzynski proposed the use of antineoplastons as a possible cancer treatment and began treating patients in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045961">clinical trials</GlossaryTermRef> at his own clinic. (See <SummaryRef href="CDR0000539333#_15" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/antineoplastons-pdq">Question 6</SummaryRef>.)  Since 1980, Dr. Burzynski has made the antineoplastons from chemicals in his laboratory, instead of taking them from urine or blood. </Para></Answer>

   <QandAEntry id="_9">
    <Question>What is the theory behind the claim that antineoplastons are useful in treating cancer?</Question>
    <Answer>
     <Para id="_10">According to Dr. Burzynski, when the body does not have enough antineoplastons, cells that begin to develop abnormally are not corrected, and tumors form and grow. He suggests that antineoplaston  therapy supplies the body with the substances needed  to  correct the abnormal development of  the cell and allow it to develop normally or to die a natural cell death, while healthy cells are not affected. </Para>

    <Question>How are antineoplastons administered?</Question>

    <Question>Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies  been conducted using antineoplastons?</Question>

     <Para id="_14">Research in a laboratory or using animals is done to find out if a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000348921">drug</GlossaryTermRef>, procedure, or treatment is likely to be useful in humans.

  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_2"><Title>General CAM Information</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_3">Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also referred to as integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_4">Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_5">Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. </Para></SummarySection> 
  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_6"><Title>Evaluation of CAM Approaches</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_7">It is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute  and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_8">Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH)  in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.</Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_9"><ExternalRef xref="http://cam.cancer.gov/cam/best_case_intro.html">The NCI Best Case Series Program</ExternalRef>   which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.</Para></SummarySection>
