The prevention of delirium in the patient with cancer has not been systematically examined, but studies in hospitalized elderly patients suggest that early identification of risk factors reduces the occurrence rate of delirium and the duration of episodes.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><Para id="_21">Delirium has been defined as a disorder of global cerebral dysfunction characterized by disordered awareness, attention, and cognition.<Reference refidx="2"/>  In addition, delirium is associated with behavioral manifestations.

Evidence and clinical experience suggest that antipsychotics play a major role in the treatment of delirium; however, only a few of these studies were conducted in patients with cancer.  Antipsychotics are antidopaminergic agents and include typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol <Reference refidx="7"/> and the newer atypical antipsychotic agents such as olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/>;<Reference refidx="17"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_138">All antipsychotics presumably work by blocking the postsynaptic dopamine receptors, primarily in the mesolimbic region. However, simultaneous blockade of striatal dopamine receptors by these agents can cause extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) such as abnormal involuntary movements, akathisia, parkinsonian symptoms, and cogwheeling.   The typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol carry a higher risk of EPS. The newer atypical antipsychotics have additional effects on the serotonin system that help reduce the EPS.</Para><Para id="_146"> Antipsychotics have a complex mechanism of action with effects on several other neurotransmitter systems. Atypical antipsychotics have been associated with higher risk of weight gain and metabolic issues because of these effects on other neurotransmitter systems. All antipsychotics have been associated with anticholinergic side effects and negative effects on the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems, depending on the medication and dosing used.</Para><SummarySection id="_162"><Title>Haloperidol</Title><Para id="_163">Haloperidol, a neuroleptic agent with potent antidopaminergic properties, is still considered the drug of choice for the treatment of delirium in the patient with cancer;<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="7"/> however, the evidence remains limited. A double-blind trial of haloperidol, chlorpromazine, and lorazepam in the treatment of hospitalized patients with delirium and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome suggested that haloperidol and chlorpromazine were equivalent in efficacy, and both were associated with a low prevalence of EPS. Lorazepam, however, was ineffective and associated with adverse effects, resulting in early closure of this arm of the protocol.<Reference refidx="18"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] The optimal dose range of haloperidol for patients with delirium has not been determined. Consensus guidelines recommended initial doses in the range of 1 to 2 mg every 2 to 4 hours as needed and lower starting doses, such as 0.5 mg every 4 hours as needed, in elderly patients.<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><Para id="_164">Haloperidol can be administered orally, intravenously, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly.  Parenteral doses are roughly twice as potent as oral doses.  Peak plasma concentrations are achieved 2 to 4 hours after an oral dose, and measurable plasma concentrations occur 15 to 30 minutes after intramuscular administration. Haloperidol may cause fewer EPS when administered intravenously. The EPS can be treated with agents such as benztropine in doses of 1 to 2 mg once or twice a day. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a rare complication with haloperidol use, is characterized by hyperthermia, increased mental confusion, leukocytosis, muscular rigidity, myoglobinuria, and high serum creatine phosphokinase. Injectable haloperidol is approved by the FDA only for intramuscular administration. However, it is frequently administered intravenously to treat agitated delirium.</Para><Para id="_165">Intravenous administration and higher doses of haloperidol have been associated with risk of sudden death due to Torsades de Pointes (TdP) and QTc prolongation. In this context, an FDA alert raised concerns about intravenous use of haloperidol.<Reference refidx="19"/> The updated labeling of haloperidol includes a strong warning about the TdP and QTc prolongation issues, especially in patients with specific cardiovascular risk factors, and recommends consideration of alternative agents. The FDA alert also recommends extreme caution and close electrocardiogram monitoring if haloperidol is administered intravenously. The FDA alert is based on case reports and small case-control studies. There are no randomized studies investigating this issue, and the data from case reports and case-control studies are confounded by multiple factors (e.g., comorbid conditions and other agents known to cause QTc prolongation).<Reference refidx="20"/></Para><Para id="_166">Evidence suggests that QTc prolongation and TdP might be primarily associated with higher haloperidol doses (6 mg or higher). No cases of QTc prolongation or TdP have been reported with a cumulative intravenous dose smaller than 2 mg. The presence of certain risk factors might increase the risk of QTc prolongation and TdP. Major risk factors include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_167" Style="bullet">

In patients with cancer, special attention should be paid to past or concomitant use of cardiotoxic chemotherapy regimens such as anthracycline-based regimens. Baseline and continuous ECG monitoring is recommended in patients receiving high doses of haloperidol and/or with known risk factors for developing QTc prolongation. Many of the alternatives (i.e., currently available typical and atypical antipsychotics) are also associated with QTc prolongation and TdP.<Reference refidx="20"/></Para><Para id="_169">In select cases, the risk-benefit equation might favor intravenous use of haloperidol, especially in patients with established intravenous access; in addition, no other currently available antipsychotics can be delivered intravenously.

In a single-blind randomized trial, the effectiveness of risperidone (n = 17) was compared with that of olanzapine (n = 15) for the treatment of delirium in patients with cancer. Both groups showed significant improvement in delirium as assessed by the Delirium Rating Scale. The response rates for improvement did not differ between the two groups. At the last observation, the mean dose of risperidone was 0.9 mg per day and that of  olanzapine was 2.4 mg per day.<Reference refidx="22"/> Risperidone is available in oral tablet and liquid formulations; dosing begins at 0.5 to 1 mg per day in two divided daily doses that are titrated, if necessary, to a total daily dose of 4 to 6 mg per day.</Para><Para id="_176">Other atypical antipsychotics—specifically, quetiapine <Reference refidx="23"/> and aripiprazole <Reference refidx="24"/>—have limited evidence in the treatment of delirium.

Lorazepam (0.5–1 mg orally or parenterally, every 1–2 hours) has also been used along with haloperidol in patients with delirium who are particularly sensitive to EPS.  </Para><Para id="_179">Another exception is midazolam, a very short-acting benzodiazepine, which is given by continuous subcutaneous or intravenous infusion in doses ranging from 30  to 100 mg over 24 hours.  Midazolam is used to achieve deep sedation, especially in a terminal hyperactive or mixed delirium when agitation is refractory to other treatments, for example, doses of haloperidol in the region of 20 mg per day.</Para><Para id="_180">The decision to use a deep level of pharmacologically induced sedation in the treatment of agitated delirium often raises ethical concerns, fueled by the marked variability in the reported frequency (ranging from 10% to 52%) for this practice in patients dying from advanced cancer.

This highlights the need to distinguish between “difficult” and “refractory” symptoms.   A clear understanding of the terminology describing  sedation and sedative medications is necessary; however, the extent to which sedation has been used for managing agitated delirium is difficult to clarify because of inconsistent definitions and confusing terminology.<Reference refidx="35"/><Reference refidx="36"/>    Nevertheless, agitated behavior requiring sedation that is variously described as delirium, terminal restlessness, mental anguish, and agitation is a recurring theme in the literature.<Reference refidx="37"/></Para><Para id="_58">A systematic review of the definitions of sedation for symptom relief noted a marked variation in the literature.<Reference refidx="36"/>   A sedation definition was proposed to include two core factors:   </Para><ItemizedList id="_64" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Presence of severe suffering refractory to standard palliative management.</ListItem><ListItem>Use of sedative medications with the primary aim of relieving distress.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_65">   This review defined palliative sedation as “the use of sedative medications to relieve intolerable and refractory distress by the reduction in patient consciousness.” The identified inconsistencies in the definition of sedation (i.e., primary versus secondary, light versus deep, and intermittent versus continuous sedation) should be subcategories of palliative sedation.<Reference refidx="36"/></Para><Para id="_80">The use of palliative sedation for psychosocial and existential symptoms can be particularly controversial.

Under this principle, the intended effect (relieving psychological suffering) would be considered allowable as long as any risks or negative effects (i.e., shortened survival) are unintended by the professional.
