This can help find cancer at an early <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045885">stage</GlossaryTermRef>. When <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044636">abnormal</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissue</GlossaryTermRef> or cancer is found early, it may be easier to treat. By the time symptoms appear, cancer may have begun to spread.</Para><Para id="_3"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044724">Scientists</GlossaryTermRef> are trying to better understand which people are more likely to get certain types of cancer. They also study the things we do and the things around us to see if they cause cancer. This information helps doctors recommend who should be screened for cancer, which screening tests should be used, and how often the tests should be done.</Para><Para id="_4">It is important to remember that your doctor does not necessarily think you have cancer if he or she suggests a screening test. Screening tests are given when you have no cancer symptoms.</Para><Para id="_5">If a screening test result is abnormal, you may need to have more tests done to find out if you have cancer.

Other tests are used because they have been shown to find cancer in some people; however, it has not been proven in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045961">clinical trials</GlossaryTermRef> that use of these tests will decrease the risk of dying from cancer.</Para><Para id="_23"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044724">Scientists</GlossaryTermRef> study screening tests to find those with the fewest risks and most benefits. Cancer screening trials also are meant to show whether early detection (finding cancer before it causes <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045022">symptoms</GlossaryTermRef>) decreases a person's chance of dying from the disease. For some types of cancer, the chance of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454708">recovery</GlossaryTermRef> is better if the disease is found and treated at an early <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045885">stage</GlossaryTermRef>.</Para><Para id="_24">Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials">NCI Web site</ExternalRef>.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_25"><KeyPoint id="_26">There is no standard or routine screening test  for testicular cancer.</KeyPoint><Para id="_67">There is no standard or routine screening test used for early detection of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000445090">testicular cancer</GlossaryTermRef>. Most often, testicular cancer is first found by men themselves, either by chance or during self-exam. Sometimes the cancer is found by a doctor during a routine <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000270871">physical exam</GlossaryTermRef>. </Para><Para id="_71">No studies have been done to find out if <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046611">testicular</GlossaryTermRef> self-exams,  regular exams by a doctor, or other screening tests in men with no symptoms would  decrease the risk of dying from this disease. However, routine screening  probably would not decrease the risk of dying from testicular cancer. This is partly because testicular cancer can usually be <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000318813">cured</GlossaryTermRef> at any stage. Finding  testicular cancer early may make it easier to treat. Patients who are <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046450">diagnosed</GlossaryTermRef> with testicular cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body may need less <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045214">chemotherapy</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045570">surgery</GlossaryTermRef>, resulting in   fewer  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046580">side effects</GlossaryTermRef>. </Para><Para id="_77">If a lump is found in the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046611">testicle</GlossaryTermRef> by the patient or during a routine physical exam, tests may be done to check for cancer.

The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language.

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
