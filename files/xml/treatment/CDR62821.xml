personal and professional lives.<Reference refidx="1"/>  The progression from the final stages of cancer to the death of a loved one is experienced in different ways by
different individuals. Every person is unique, and thus there will be many individual differences in grief experiences. Most people will experience common or normal grief and will cope well; others will experience more severe grief reactions such as prolonged or complicated grief and will benefit from treatment. Some may even find that the cancer
experience, although it is difficult and trying, may lead to significant
personal growth.</Para><Para id="_151">Coping with death is usually not an easy process and cannot be dealt with in a cookbook fashion. The way in which a person will grieve depends on the personality of the grieving individual and his or her relationship with the person who died. The cancer experience; the manner of disease progression; one’s cultural and religious beliefs, coping skills, and psychiatric history; the availability of support systems; and one’s socioeconomic status all affect how a person will cope with the loss of a loved one via cancer.</Para><Para id="_152">This summary first defines the constructs of grief, bereavement, and mourning. It then distinguishes the grief reactions of anticipatory grief, normal or common grief, stage models of normal grief, and complicated or prolonged grief. Psychosocial and pharmacologic treatments are explained. The important developmental issues of children and grief are presented, and a section on cross-cultural responses to grief and mourning concludes the summary.</Para><Para id="_153">The following information combines theoretical and empirical reviews of the general literature on grief, bereavement, and mourning <Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/> and is not specific to loss via cancer. Where available, studies that have focused on cancer are emphasized.</Para><Para id="_149_4">In this summary, unless otherwise stated, evidence and practice issues as they relate to adults are discussed.  The evidence and application to practice related to children may differ significantly from information related to adults.  When specific information about the care of children is available, it is summarized under its own heading.</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="11177334" MedlineID="21091601">Casarett D, Kutner JS, Abrahm J, et al.: Life after death: a practical approach to grief and bereavement.

impending loss.<Reference refidx="8"/>  Anticipatory grief is  the subject of considerable concern and
controversy.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_169">The term <Emphasis>anticipatory grief</Emphasis> is most often used when discussing the families
of dying persons, although dying individuals themselves can experience
anticipatory grief.  Anticipatory grief  includes many of the same symptoms
of grief after a loss.  Anticipatory grief has been defined as “the total set
of cognitive, affective, cultural, and social reactions to expected death felt
by the patient and family.”<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_170">The following aspects of anticipatory grief  have been identified among survivors:</Para><ItemizedList id="_171" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Depression.</ListItem><ListItem>Heightened concern for the
dying person.</ListItem><ListItem>Rehearsal of the death.</ListItem><ListItem>Attempts to adjust to the
consequences of the death.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_172">Anticipatory grief provides family members with
time to gradually absorb the reality of the loss.  Individuals are able to
complete unfinished business with the dying person (e.g., saying “good-bye,”
“I love you,” or “I forgive you”).</Para><Para id="_178">Anticipatory grief cannot be assumed to be present merely because a warning of
a life-threatening illness has been given or because a sufficient length of
time has elapsed from the onset of illness until actual death.  A major
misconception is that anticipatory grief is merely conventional (postdeath)
grief begun earlier.  Another fallacy is that there is a fixed volume of grief
to be experienced, implying that the amount of grief experienced in
anticipation of the loss will decrease the remaining grief that will need to be
experienced after the death.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_179">Several studies <Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/> have provided clinical data documenting that grief
following an unanticipated death differs from anticipatory grief. 
Unanticipated loss overwhelms the adaptive capacities of the individual,
seriously compromising his or her functioning to the point that uncomplicated
recovery cannot be expected.  Because the adaptive capacities are severely
assaulted in unanticipated grief, mourners are often unable to grasp the full
implications of their loss.  Despite intellectual recognition of the death,
there is difficulty in the psychologic and emotional acceptance of the loss,
which may continue to seem inexplicable.  The world seems to be without order,
and like the loss, does not make sense.</Para><Para id="_180">Some researchers report that anticipatory grief rarely occurs.  They support this observation by noting that the periods of acceptance and recovery usually
observed early in the grieving process are rarely found before the patient’s
actual death, no matter how early the forewarning.<Reference refidx="9"/>  In addition,  they note that grief
implies that there has been a loss; to accept a loved one’s death while he or
she is still alive can leave the bereaved vulnerable to self-accusation for
having partially abandoned the dying patient.  Finally, anticipation of loss
frequently intensifies attachment to the person.</Para><Para id="_181">Although anticipatory grief may be therapeutic for families and 
other caregivers, there is concern that the dying person may experience too much grief,
thus creating social withdrawal and detachment.  Research indicates that widows
usually remain involved with their dying husbands until the time of death.<Reference refidx="13"/> 
This suggests that it was dysfunctional for the widows to have begun
grieving in advance of their husbands’ deaths.  The widows could begin to mourn
only after the actual death took place.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_182"><Title>Normal or Common Grief</Title><Para id="_183">In general, normal or common grief reactions are marked by a gradual movement toward an acceptance of the loss and, although daily functioning can be very difficult, managing to continue with basic daily activities. Normal grief usually includes some common emotional reactions that include emotional numbness, shock, disbelief, and/or denial often occurring immediately after the death, particularly if the death is unexpected. Much emotional distress is focused on the anxiety of separation from the loved one, which often results in yearning, searching, preoccupation with the loved one, and frequent intrusive images of death.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_184">Such distress can be accompanied by crying; sighing; having dreams, illusions, and even hallucinations of the deceased; and seeking out things or places associated with the deceased individual. Some bereaved people will experience anger, will protest the reality of the loss, and will have significant periods of sadness, despair, insomnia, anorexia, fatigue, guilt, loss of interest, and disorganization in daily routine.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_185">Many bereaved persons will experience highly intense, time-limited periods (e.g., 20–30 minutes) of distress, variously called grief bursts or pangs. Sometimes these pangs are understandable reactions to reminders of the deceased person, and at other times they seem to occur unexpectedly.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><Para id="_186">Over time, most bereaved people will experience symptoms less frequently, with briefer duration, or with less intensity. Although there is no clear agreement on any specific time period  needed for recovery, most bereaved persons experiencing normal grief will note a lessening of symptoms at anywhere from 6 months through 2 years postloss. Normal or common grief appears to occur in 50% to 85% of persons following a loss, is time-limited, begins soon after a loss, and largely resolves within the first year or two.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_187"><Title>Stage Models of Normal Grief</Title><Para id="_188">A number of theoretically derived stage models of normal grief have been proposed.<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/> Most models hypothesize a normal grief process differentiated from various types of complicated grief. Some models have organized the variety of grief-related symptoms into phases or stages, suggesting that grief is a process marked by a series of phases, with each phase consisting of predominant characteristics. One well-known stage model,<Reference refidx="18"/> focusing on the responses of terminally ill patients to awareness of their own deaths, identified the stages of denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Although widely used, this model has received little empirical support.</Para><Para id="_189">A more recent stage model of normal grief <Reference refidx="2"/> organizes psychological responses into four stages: numbness-disbelief, separation distress, depression-mourning, and recovery.<Reference refidx="5"/> Although presented as a stage model, this model explains "it is important to emphasize that the idea that grief unfolds inexorably in regular phases is an oversimplification of the highly complex personal waxing and waning of the emotional process."<Reference refidx="2"/> Bereavement researchers have found empirical support for this four-stage model,<Reference refidx="5"/> although other researchers have questioned these findings.<Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="20"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_190"><Title>Patterns of Complicated Grief</Title><Para id="_191">Since the time of Sigmund Freud, many authors have proposed various patterns of pathologic or complicated grief.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/> Some proposed patterns come from extensive clinical observation <Reference refidx="20"/> supported by various theories (e.g., psychodynamic defense mechanisms and personality traits associated with patterns of attachment).<Reference refidx="21"/></Para><Para id="_192">These patterns are described in comparison to normal grief and highlight variations from the normal pattern. They include descriptive labels such as the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_193" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Inhibited or absent grief: A pattern in which persons show little evidence of the expected separation distress, seeking, yearning, or other characteristics of normal grief.</ListItem><ListItem>Delayed grief: A pattern in which symptoms of distress, seeking, yearning, etc., occur at a much later time than is typical.</ListItem><ListItem>Chronic grief: A pattern emphasizing prolonged duration of grief symptoms.</ListItem><ListItem>Distorted grief: A pattern characterized by extremely intense or atypical symptoms.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_194">Empirical reviews have not found evidence of inhibited, absent, or delayed grief and instead emphasize the possibility that these patterns are better explained as forms of human resilience and strength.<Reference refidx="6"/> Evidence supports the existence of a minimal grief reaction—a pattern in which persons experience no, or only a few, signs of overt distress or disruption in functioning. This minimal reaction is thought to occur in 15% to 50% of persons during the first year or two after a loss.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_195">Empirical support also exists for chronic grief, a pattern of responding in which persons experience symptoms of common grief but do so for a much longer time than the typical year or two. Chronic grief is thought to occur in about 15% of bereaved persons.<Reference refidx="6"/> It may look very much like major depression, generalized anxiety, and possibly post-traumatic stress.</Para><Para id="_196">In addition to these theoretical and empirically supported patterns of grief reactions, much emphasis has been placed on distinguishing normal grief from complicated grief. Most clinicians will be focused on understanding the differences between normal and complicated grief reactions: What is the difference? Under what circumstances should I refer a patient/family member for grief therapy?</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_197"><Title>Prolonged or Complicated Grief as a Mental Disorder</Title><Para id="_198">The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) includes bereavement as a diagnosable code to be used when bereavement is a focus of clinical attention following the death of a loved one. In current form it does not consist of formal diagnostic criteria and is generally considered a normal reaction to loss via death. In an attempt to clearly distinguish between normal grief and complicated grief, a consensus conference <Reference refidx="22"/> has developed diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder referred to as prolonged grief disorder, proposing that it be included in the next revision of the DSM.<Reference refidx="23"/></Para><Para id="_199">Following are the proposed diagnostic criteria for complicated grief:<Reference refidx="24"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_200" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>Criterion A: Person has experienced the death of a significant other, and response involves three of the four following symptoms, experienced at least daily or to a marked degree:<ItemizedList id="_201" Style="dash"><ListItem>Intrusive thoughts about the deceased.</ListItem><ListItem>Yearning for the deceased.</ListItem><ListItem>Searching for the deceased.</ListItem><ListItem>Excessive loneliness since the death.</ListItem></ItemizedList></ListItem><ListItem>Criterion B: In response to the death, four of the eight following symptoms are experienced at least daily or to a marked degree:<ItemizedList id="_202" Style="dash"><ListItem>Purposelessness or feelings of futility about the future.</ListItem><ListItem>Subjective sense of numbness, detachment, or absence of emotional responsiveness.</ListItem><ListItem>Difficulty acknowledging the death (e.g., disbelief).</ListItem><ListItem>Feeling that life is empty or meaningless.</ListItem><ListItem>Feeling that part of oneself has died.</ListItem><ListItem>Shattered worldview (e.g., lost sense of security, trust, control).</ListItem><ListItem>Assumption of symptoms or harmful behaviors of, or related to, the deceased person.</ListItem><ListItem>Excessive irritability, bitterness, or anger related to the death.</ListItem></ItemizedList></ListItem><ListItem>Criterion C: The disturbance (symptoms listed) must endure for at least 6 months.</ListItem><ListItem>Criterion D: The disturbance causes clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_203">These criteria have not been formally adopted, and thus there is no formal diagnostic category for prolonged grief disorders in the DSM. However, these criteria help in specifying symptoms, the severity of symptoms, and how to distinguish complicated grief from normal grief.</Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="11434227">Bonanno GA, Kaltman S: The varieties of grief experience.

Researchers disagree about whether credible evidence on the efficacy of grief counseling exists.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> Most bereaved persons experience painful and often very distressing emotional, physical, and social reactions; however, most researchers agree that most bereaved persons adapt over time, typically within the first 6 months to 2 years. Thus, the question is whether it is wise to devote professional time to interventions for normal grief when resources are limited and the need for accountability is great.</Para><Para id="_231">One approach is to use a spectrum of interventions, from prevention to treatment to long-term maintenance care.<Reference refidx="5"/> In this model, preventive interventions could be one of the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_232" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Universal and targeted to all persons in the population.</ListItem><ListItem>Selective and targeted to persons with known risk factors.</ListItem><ListItem>Indicated for persons experiencing significant symptom distress.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_233">In contrast, formal treatment of bereaved persons would be reserved for those identified as experiencing complicated or pathologic grief reactions.

Both studies are of interventions for bereaved persons whose loved ones died from mixed (not necessarily cancer-related) causes.</Para><Para id="_243">The first study <Reference refidx="9"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] compared complicated grief treatment (CGT) with interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) in 83 women and 12 men, aged 18 to 85 years prescreened, who met the criteria for complicated grief. Both interventions consisted of 16 weekly sessions spread out over an average of 19 weeks per participant. IPT is a widely researched, empirically supported treatment intervention for depression.</Para><Para id="_244">IPT therapists used an intervention delivered as described in a published manual,<Reference refidx="10"/> using an introductory phase, a middle phase, and a termination phase. During the introductory phase, symptoms were identified, and an inventory of interpersonal relationships was completed, with a focus on interpersonal problems. Connections between symptoms, interpersonal problems, and grief were identified and discussed.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_245">During the middle phase, these interpersonal problems and issues of grief were addressed. Patients were encouraged to develop a realistic relationship with the deceased, to recognize both positive and negative aspects of the loss, and to invest in new, positive relationships.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_246">During the termination phase, gains were identified and reviewed, future plans were made and feelings about termination were discussed.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_247">CGT was also delivered according to a manual protocol, also organized into three phases. In the introductory phase, therapists described the distinctions between normal and complicated grief. They also explained the concept of dual processing, or the notion that grief progresses best when attention alternates between (a) a focus on loss and (b) a focus on restoration and future. Thus, the introductory phase included both a discussion of the loss and an identification of future goals and aspirations.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_248">Throughout the middle phase, attention alternated between the themes of loss/grief and future/restoration. A unique characteristic of CGT was the concept of revisiting loss via retelling the story of the death. This concept was particularly important for persons inclined to avoid thinking about the trauma of the loss. Specific procedures that were modeled after the "imaginal exposure" component of interventions for post-traumatic stress disorder were utilized for retelling.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_249">The termination phase for the CGT group was similar to that for the IPT group.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_250">Both treatments showed improvements in symptoms, with the CGT group showing a larger percentage of patients responding (51%) than the IPT group (28%). The CGT group also seemed to respond quicker than the IPT group. A total of 45% of all study participants were taking antidepressants. No significant differences in outcomes were found for those on antidepressant medications.<Reference refidx="9"/></Para><Para id="_251">The second study of complicated grief <Reference refidx="11"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] compared cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), offered in two different sequences, with supportive counseling for 54 bereaved persons, all prescreened and found to be experiencing complicated grief.</Para><Para id="_252">With researchers hypothesizing that maladaptive thoughts and behaviors are an important component of complicated grief, the CBT interventions consisted of two components (exposure therapy and cognitive restructuring) designed to directly impact grief-related thoughts and behaviors.<Reference refidx="11"/> Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of three treatments:</Para><ItemizedList id="_253" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Exposure therapy followed by cognitive restructuring.</ListItem><ListItem>Cognitive restructuring followed by exposure therapy.</ListItem><ListItem>Supportive counseling.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_254">Results showed that both CBT groups experienced more improvement in symptoms of complicated grief and general psychopathology than did the supportive counseling group. In component analyses, the exposure therapy component was more effective than the cognitive restructuring component; the sequence of exposure therapy first, followed by cognitive restructuring, produced the best results.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_255"><Title>Pharmacologic Treatment of Bereavement-Related Depression</Title><Para id="_256">The clinical decision on whether to provide pharmacologic treatment for depressive symptoms in the context of bereavement is controversial and not very extensively studied. Some health care professionals argue that distinguishing the sadness and distress of normal grief from the sadness and distress of depression is difficult, and pharmacologic treatment of a normal emotional process is not warranted. However, three open-label trials and one randomized controlled trial of treatment of bereavement-related depression with antidepressants have been reported (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062821#_263" url="/about-cancer/advanced-cancer/caregivers/planning/bereavement-hp-pdq">Table 1</SummaryRef>).</Para><Para id="_257">The open-label trials evaluated desipramine,<Reference refidx="12"/> nortriptyline,<Reference refidx="13"/> and bupropion sustained release.<Reference refidx="14"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>] The studies included patients experiencing depressive symptoms after the deaths of their loved ones. The depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). All studies evaluated intensity of grief using select grief assessment questionnaires.</Para><Para id="_258">Data from these studies suggest that antidepressants are well tolerated and improve symptoms of depression. Data also suggest that the intensity of grief improved but that the improvement was consistently less in comparison with the symptoms of depression. Limitations of these studies include open-label treatment and small sample sizes.</Para><Para id="_259">The only randomized controlled study conducted to date <Reference refidx="15"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] compared nortriptyline with placebo for the treatment of bereavement-related major depressive episodes. Nortriptyline was also compared with two other treatments, one combining nortriptyline with IPT and the other combining placebo with IPT. Eighty subjects, aged 50 years or older, were randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups: nortriptyline (n = 25), placebo (n = 22), nortriptyline plus IPT (n = 16), and placebo plus IPT (n = 17).</Para><Para id="_260">The 17-item HDRS was used to assess depressive symptoms. Remission was defined as a score of 7 or lower for 3 consecutive weeks. The remission rates for the four groups were as follows: nortriptyline alone, 56%; placebo alone, 45%; nortriptyline plus IPT, 69%; placebo plus IPT, 29%. Nortriptyline was superior to placebo in achieving remission (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .03).<Reference refidx="15"/></Para><Para id="_261">The combination of nortriptyline with IPT was associated with the highest remission rate and highest rate of treatment completion. The study did not show a difference between IPT and placebo, possibly owing to specific aspects of the study design, including short duration of IPT (mean no. of days, 49.5) and small sample size.<Reference refidx="15"/> The high remission rate with placebo was another important limitation of the study. Consistent with previous open-label studies and for all four groups, improvement in grief intensity was less than improvement in depressive symptoms.</Para><Para id="_262">In summary, all of the antidepressant studies conducted to date suggest that the magnitude of reduction and rate of improvement in grief symptoms are slower than the decrease in magnitude and rate of improvement in depressive symptoms. One group of researchers <Reference refidx="15"/> provides possible explanations for this phenomenon, arguing that depressive symptoms may be more responsive to pharmacological intervention because they are directly related to biological dysregulation and neurochemical changes. The other possibility is that the persistence of grief without depressive symptoms is not pathological—it might be a normal and necessary consequence of the bereavement process.</Para></SummarySection><Table id="_263"><Title>Table 1.

were expected to be modeled as such.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Today there is a greater 
awareness of developmental differences between childhood and other developmental stages
in the human life cycle.  Differences between the grieving
process for children and the grieving process for adults are recognized.  It is now believed that the real issue
for grieving children is not whether they grieve, but how they exhibit their
grief and mourning.<Reference refidx="1"/>
</Para><Para id="_55">The primary difference between bereaved adults and bereaved children is that intense
emotional and behavioral expressions are not continuous in children.  A child’s
grief may appear more intermittent and briefer than that of an adult, but in
fact a child's grief usually lasts longer.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_175">The work of mourning in childhood  needs to be addressed
repeatedly  at different developmental and chronological milestones.  Because
bereavement is a process that continues over time, children will revisit the
loss repeatedly, especially during significant life events (e.g., going to
camp, graduating from school, marrying, and experiencing the births of their own children). 
Children must complete the grieving process, eventually achieving resolution of grief.</Para><Para id="_56">Although the experience of loss is unique and highly individualized, several factors can

their feelings as openly as adults do.  In addition to verbal communication, grieving children may employ play, drama, art,
school work, and stories.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Bereaved children may not withdraw into
preoccupation with thoughts of the deceased person; they often immerse
themselves in activities (e.g., they may be sad one minute and then playing
outside with friends the next).  Families often incorrectly interpret this
behavior to mean the child does not really understand or has already gotten
over the death.  Neither assumption may be true; children's minds protect them from
thoughts and feelings that are too powerful for them to handle.</Para><Para id="_177">Grief
reactions are intermittent because children cannot explore all their
thoughts and feelings as rationally as adults can.  Additionally, children often have
difficulty articulating their feelings about grief.  A grieving child’s
behavior may speak louder than any words he or she could speak.  Strong
feelings of anger and fear of abandonment or death may be evident in the
behaviors of grieving children.  Children often play death games as a way of
working out their feelings and anxieties in a relatively safe setting.  These
games are familiar to the children and provide safe opportunities to express
their feelings.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/></Para><SummarySection id="_58"><Title>Grief and Developmental Stages</Title><Para id="_59">Death and the events surrounding it are understood differently depending on a child's

some limited way.  They do not fully separate death from life and may believe that the deceased continues to live (for instance, in the ground
where he or she was buried)  and often ask questions about the activities of
the deceased person (e.g., how is the deceased eating, going to the toilet,
breathing, or playing?).  Young children can acknowledge physical death but
consider it a temporary or gradual event, reversible and not final
(like leaving and returning, or a game of peek-a-boo).  A child’s concept of
death may involve magical thinking, i.e., the idea that his or her thoughts can
cause actions.  Children may feel that they must have done or thought something
bad to become ill or that a loved one’s death occurred because of some personal
thought or wish.  In response to death, children younger than 5 years will
often exhibit disturbances in eating, sleeping, and bladder or bowel
control.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="6"/>

asking very concrete questions about what happens to one’s body when it stops

ghost, angel of death, or bogeyman.  Although death is perceived as final and
frightening, it is not universal.  Children in this age range begin to compromise,
recognizing that death is final and real but mostly happens to older people (not
to themselves).  Grieving children can develop school phobias, learning
problems, and antisocial or aggressive behaviors; can exhibit hypochondriacal
concerns; or can withdraw from others.  Conversely, children in this age range can
become overly attentive and clinging.  Boys may show an increase in
aggressive and destructive behavior (e.g., acting out in school), expressing
their feelings in this way rather than by openly displaying sadness.  When a
parent dies, children may feel abandoned by both their deceased parent and their
surviving parent, since the surviving parent is frequently preoccupied with his or

communication.  In contrast, children often talk to those around them (even

their own responses.  It is not uncommon for children to repeatedly ask
baffling questions.  For example, a child may ask, “I know Grandpa died, but
when will he come home?”  This is thought to be a way of testing reality for
the child and confirming the story of the death.

Children need to be reassured about their own security (they frequently worry
that they will also die or that their surviving parent will go away). 
A child’s questions should be answered, and the child's processing of
the information should be confirmed.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_85"><Title>Correct language</Title><Para id="_86">Although it is a difficult conversation to initiate with children, any
discussion about death must include proper words (e.g., <Emphasis>cancer</Emphasis>, <Emphasis>died</Emphasis>,
or <Emphasis>death</Emphasis>).  Euphemisms (e.g., “he passed away,” “he is sleeping,” or “we lost him”)
should never be used because they can confuse children and lead to
misinterpretations.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="8"/>
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_87"><Title>Planning rituals</Title><Para id="_88">After a death occurs, children can and should be included in the planning of and
participation in mourning rituals.  As with bereaved adults, these rituals help
children  memorialize loved ones.  Although children should never be forced
to attend or participate in mourning rituals, their participation should be
encouraged.  Children can be encouraged to participate in the aspects of
funeral or memorial services with which they feel comfortable.  If the child
wants to attend the funeral (or wake or memorial service), it is important that
a full explanation of what to expect is given in advance.  This preparation
should include the layout of the room, who might be present (e.g., friends and
family members), what the child will see (e.g., a casket and people crying), and
what will happen.  Surviving parents may be too involved in their own
grief to give their children the attention they need. Therefore, it is often helpful
to identify a familiar adult friend or family member who will be assigned to
care for a grieving child during a funeral.<Reference refidx="8"/>

treasured possession, or to a significant life change, is a universal
occurrence that crosses all ages and cultures.  However, there are many aspects
of grief about which little is known, including the role that cultural heritage
plays in an individual’s experience of grief and mourning.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>  Attitudes,
beliefs, and practices regarding death and grief are characterized and
described according to multicultural context, myth, mysteries, and mores that
describe cross-cultural relationships.<Reference refidx="2"/>
</Para><Para id="_108">The potential for contradiction between an individual’s intrapersonal
experience of grief and his or her cultural expression of grief can be
explained by the prevalent (though incorrect) synonymous use of the terms
<Emphasis>grief</Emphasis> (the highly personalized process of experiencing reactions to perceived
loss) and <Emphasis>mourning</Emphasis> (the socially or culturally defined behavioral displays of
grief).<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/>
</Para><Para id="_109">An analysis of the results of several focus groups, each consisting of
individuals from a specific culture, reveals that individual, intrapersonal
experiences of grief are similar across cultural boundaries.  This is true even
considering the culturally distinct mourning rituals, traditions, and
behavioral expressions of grief experienced by the participants.  Health care
professionals need to understand the part that may be played by cultural mourning practices in an individual’s overall grief experience if they are to provide culturally
sensitive care to their patients.<Reference refidx="1"/>
</Para><Para id="_110">In spite of legislation, health regulations, customs, and work rules that have
greatly influenced how death is managed in the United States, bereavement
practices vary in profound ways depending on one’s cultural background.  When
assessing an individual’s response to the death of a loved one, clinicians
should identify and appreciate what is expected or required by the person’s
culture.  Failing to carry out expected rituals can lead to an experience of
unresolved loss for family members.<Reference refidx="5"/>  This is often a daunting task when
health care professionals serve patients of many ethnicities.<Reference refidx="2"/>
</Para><Para id="_111">Helping family members cope with the death of a loved one includes showing
respect for the family’s cultural heritage and encouraging them to decide how
to commemorate the death.  Clinicians
consider the following five questions particularly important to ask those who are coping with the emotional
aftermath of the death of a loved one:
</Para><OrderedList id="_122" Style="Arabic"><ListItem> What are the culturally prescribed rituals for managing the dying process,
the body of the deceased, the disposal of the body, and commemoration of the death?</ListItem><ListItem>What are the family’s beliefs about what happens after death?</ListItem><ListItem> What does the family consider an appropriate emotional expression and   
integration of the loss?</ListItem><ListItem> What does the family consider to be the gender rules for handling the   
death?
</ListItem><ListItem>Do certain types of death carry a stigma (e.g., suicide), or are certain   
types of death especially traumatic for that cultural group (e.g., death of a
child)?<Reference refidx="6"/></ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_117">Death, grief, and mourning are universal and natural aspects of the life
process.  All cultures have evolved practices that best meet their needs for
dealing with death.  Hindering these practices can disrupt
the necessary grieving process.  Understanding these practices can help
clinicians to identify and develop ways to treat patients of other cultures 
who are demonstrating atypical grief.<Reference refidx="7"/>  Given current ethnodemographic
trends, health care professionals need to address these cultural differences in
order to best serve these populations.<Reference refidx="2"/></Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="8708241" MedlineID="96209065">Cowles KV: Cultural perspectives of grief: an expanded concept analysis.
