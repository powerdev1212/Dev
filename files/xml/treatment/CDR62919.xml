detected after careful search and does not appear during therapy.  Patients
with cervical lymph node metastases histologically related to a previously
treated primary tumor and patients with lymphomas and adenocarcinoma are
excluded.  If the biopsy is an undifferentiated carcinoma (in particular, a
lymphoepithelioma), the most probable primary site is in Waldeyer ring; for
example, the nasopharynx, base of tongue, or tonsil.  Most epidermoid
carcinomas metastatic to lymph nodes of the upper half of the neck will
originate from a head and neck primary site.  Squamous carcinomas metastatic to
the lower neck may represent a primary site in the head and neck, esophagus,
lung, or genitourinary tract.  A search for primaries in these areas must be
undertaken before assuming that the primary is occult.  Primary tumors
arising in the nasopharynx may be secondary to Epstein-Barr Virus
(EBV) infection, and EBV genomic material may be detectable in cervical nodal
tissue after DNA amplification using the polymerase chain reaction.  Such a
finding should lead to an in-depth search for a primary in the nasopharynx.<Reference refidx="1"/> 
</Para><Para id="_67">The extent of investigation and type of treatment must be individualized
depending on the patient's age and wishes, and on the site, histology, and extent of metastatic lymph
node involvement of the tumor.  When a patient qualifies as
having squamous carcinoma of the neck with occult primary, he or she should be checked for other
obvious metastatic disease, such as lung, liver, or bone, since this would
affect the locoregional approach to therapy.<Reference refidx="2"/>
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_93"><Title>Survival</Title><Para id="_3">Three-year, disease-free survival rates following surgery and/or radiation
therapy for unknown squamous primaries range from 40% to 50% in patients with N1 disease to 38%
and 26% for patients with N2 and N3 disease, respectively.  Patients who later develop
primary lesions have poor survival rates compared to those patients whose
primaries remain occult, for example 30% versus 60%.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_94"><Title>Follow-up</Title><Para id="_4">Patients with neck metastases from an undetectable primary should be given the benefit of definitive treatment.  Despite the ominous
situation of an undiscovered primary, a significant number of patients do
achieve cure by both surgical and radiotherapeutic approaches.  In some
patients, long-term repeat examinations will eventually disclose the primary
tumor, and at a treatable stage.

diagnosis for an unknown primary presenting with cervical node metastases.  The
therapeutic section, however, relates only to squamous carcinoma and assumes
that the primary physician has worked with the pathologist as described below
to eliminate other possibilities that would require alternative therapies.
</Para><Para id="_7">The pathologist plays a central role in evaluating an occult primary tumor.  A
thorough evaluation of an adequate specimen through histologic or
immunohistochemical techniques, and, when appropriate, electron microscopy (EM)
provides guidance for the clinical evaluation that ensues.  A critical
interaction should exist between the pathologist, oncologist, and primary
physician.
</Para><Para id="_8">The complexity of the pathologic evaluation tends to be inversely related to
the degree of differentiation of the tumor.  For instance, for well or
moderately differentiated tumors, the pathologic diagnosis of an epithelial
cancer is often readily apparent, in contrast to lymphoma, sarcoma, melanoma,
or a germ cell tumor.  Commonly used stains such as mucicarmine or
diastase-sensitive Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) can be important in confirming
the diagnosis of certain tumors of gastrointestinal or renal origin.
</Para><Para id="_9">If the clinician is faced with a male patient younger than 50 years with a
poorly differentiated tumor, serum levels of bHCG and AFP should be obtained
and specimens should be evaluated with immunohistochemical stains for bHCG and
AFP.  Certain of these tumors respond to platinum-based combination
chemotherapy in a manner similar to extragonadal germ cell malignancies, and
this group of patients should be so treated unless other alternative diagnoses
are made.<Reference refidx="1"/>
</Para><Para id="_10">Special studies can help in differentiating more poorly differentiated tumors. 
Often, a generic distinction is important between a poorly differentiated tumor
of epithelial, hematopoietic, neuroendocrine, or neuroectodermal origin (i.e.,
melanoma).
</Para><ItemizedList id="_57" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Immunohistochemical:<Para id="_12">Immunohistochemical studies can be important in making these broad
distinctions, in particular, studies that evaluate staining for keratins,
leukocyte common antigen (LCA), and S-100, a neuroectodermal antigen expressed
in melanomas.<Reference refidx="2"/>
</Para></ListItem><ListItem>Polymerase chain reaction:<Para id="_14">In patients with suspected nasopharyngeal carcinoma, DNA amplification of
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes can be used for diagnosis with tissue provided
by fine-needle aspiration biopsy.  The presence of EBV in metastases from an
occult primary tumor suggests the development of overt nasopharyngeal
carcinoma.<Reference refidx="3"/>
</Para><Para id="_15">Acinar spaces and microacini are seen with adenocarcinomas.  Electron dense
secretory granules are seen in tumors of neuroectodermal origin. 
Premelanosomes can be found in most amelanotic melanomas.  But these features
are generally associated with differentiation along a particular line.  Often
poorly differentiated tumors do not display such characteristics, and EM
evaluation would be of little value.  The use of EM may aid in
distinguishing a primary diagnosis not obtained by light microscopy
approximately 10% of the time.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>
