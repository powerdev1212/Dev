clinically in approximately 3% of patients; this situation is often referred to
as CUP origin or occult primary malignancy.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>
</Para><SummarySection id="_117"><Title>Prognosis and Survival</Title><Para id="_3">The definition of a CUP varies from study to study; however, at a minimum, this
determination should include a biopsy of the tumor and a thorough history and
complete physical examination that includes head and neck, rectal, pelvic, and
breast examinations; chest x-rays; a complete blood cell count; urinalysis; and
an examination of the stool for occult blood.  The value of other radiographic
tests will be discussed in the stage information section.  When these results
do not reveal signs of a potential primary lesion and the biopsy is not
consistent with a primary tumor at the biopsy site, a CUP must be assumed.  The
majority of CUP are adenocarcinomas or undifferentiated tumors; less commonly,
squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, sarcoma, and neuroendocrine tumors can also
present with a primary site of origin that cannot be determined. In approximately 15% to 25% of patients, the primary site cannot be identified even at postmortem examination.<Reference refidx="7"/>
</Para><Para id="_4">The prognosis for patients with CUP is poor.  As a group, the median survival
is approximately 3 to 4 months with less than 25% and 10% of
patients alive at 1 and 5 years, respectively.  CUP is represented by a
heterogeneous group of diseases all of which have presented with metastasis as
the primary manifestation.  Although the majority of diseases are relatively
refractory to systemic treatments, certain clinical presentations of
CUP carry a much better prognosis.  In each instance, distinct
clinical and pathologic details require consideration for appropriate,
potentially curative, management.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/>
</Para><Para id="_5">A retrospective review of 657 consecutive patients with CUP (270 additional
patients were excluded as a result of identification of a primary malignancy, a
noncarcinoma cell type, or no malignancy) reported several variables of
significant prognostic importance identified by multivariate analysis.<Reference refidx="11"/>  Lymph
node involvement and neuroendocrine histology were associated with longer
survival; male sex, increasing number of involved organ sites, adenocarcinoma
histology, and hepatic involvement were unfavorable prognostic factors. 
Adrenal involvement has also been noted to be a poor prognostic finding.<Reference refidx="12"/>
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_118"><Title>Diagnosis and Patterns of Metastases</Title><Para id="_6">Conceptually, CUP represents a tumor that has a greater propensity for early dissemination than the more common presentation in which
the primary tumor is apparent with or without metastasis.
</Para><Para id="_7">The distribution of primary sites that are likely to result in CUP contrasts
with the distribution of major primary adenocarcinomas as reported in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data.  Most large studies have shown that
carcinoma of the lung and pancreas are the most common primary carcinomas that
initially present as CUP.  Other common malignancies such as colorectal,
breast, and prostate cancers infrequently present as CUP.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/>
</Para><Para id="_8">The pattern of spread of CUP at diagnosis can provide clues to the likelihood
of the primary site being above or below the diaphragm.  Lung metastases are
twice as common in primary sites ultimately found to be above the diaphragm. 
Liver metastases are more common from primary disease below the diaphragm.  The
pattern of metastasis from a carcinoma presenting as CUP may be significantly
different from that which would be expected from the usual presentation.  For
instance, bone metastases are approximately three times more common in pancreatic
cancer that presents as CUP, while osseous metastasis from lung cancer is about 10
times less common when it presents as CUP, compared with the usual presentation. 
The biologic bases for these differences in presentation, incidence, and
pattern of metastases are unknown.<Reference refidx="7"/>
</Para><Para id="_9">Although only a minority of patients will have curable disease or a disease for
which there is substantial palliative benefit, the appropriate use of special
diagnostic pathology and selected radiologic studies will identify patients for whom directed therapy will provide the best possible chance for response.

primary (CUP).  A thorough evaluation of an adequate specimen for
histologic, immunohistochemical, and, when appropriate, electron microscopic
evaluations is probably the most important clue in the diagnostic
puzzle of CUP.  Pathologic evaluations provide guidance for an appropriate clinical
evaluation.  An obvious corollary to the pathologist’s role is the critical
interaction between the pathologist, oncologist, and primary physician.<Reference refidx="1"/>
</Para><Para id="_12">The complexity of the pathologic evaluation tends to be inversely related to
the degree of differentiation of the tumor.  For well- or moderately differentiated tumors, the pathologic diagnosis of an epithelial cancer versus
lymphoma, sarcoma, melanoma, or a germ cell tumor, for instance, is often
readily apparent.  Commonly used histologic stains such as mucicarmine or
diastase-sensitive Periodic Acid Schiff can be important in confirming the
diagnosis of certain tumors of gastrointestinal or renal origin.
</Para><Para id="_13">Special studies can help in distinguishing tumors that are poorly differentiated;<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>   the generic distinction between a poorly differentiated
tumor of epithelial, hematopoietic, or neuroectodermal origin (i.e., melanoma)
is important.  Microsatellite analysis has been used to assess genetic
alterations in cervical lymph nodes.  These alterations were identical in 18 patients with normal mucosal histology and malignant nodes,
suggesting a site of primary tumor origin.<Reference refidx="4"/> 
</Para><Para id="_14">Other diagnostic tests:
</Para><ItemizedList id="_72" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem><Strong>Immunohistochemical analysis:</Strong> Several studies can be important in making these broad distinctions; in
particular, studies that evaluate staining for keratins, leukocyte common
antigen, and S-100, a neuroectodermal antigen expressed in melanomas.<Reference refidx="5"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Gene expression profiling:</Strong> Gene expression profiling using an immunohistochemical panel may allow identification of a potential site of origin in patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown origin.  One study reported identification of a potential primary site in  14 of 22 patients.<Reference refidx="6"/> This modality has not been validated against the gold standard and has not been studied prospectively.</ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) analysis:</Strong> This histochemical study can accurately differentiate tumors of prostatic
origin from other types of cancer. Prostate cancer is most often found by digital rectal examination.  Approximately
3% of CUPs are ultimately shown to be prostate cancer.  These cancers, as
mentioned above, appear to have a different metastatic distribution than the
predominant bony distribution that is generally encountered in prostate cancer. 
When the primary disease may be suspected to  have arisen from
the prostate, prostate cancer-specific tests should be performed to rule out a diagnosis of primary prostate cancer.<Reference refidx="7"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) analysis:
</Strong>Immunohistochemical stains are available for both of these proteins.  Although
neither protein is absolutely specific for germ cell tumors, and AFP is not specific for hepatoma, they are important because germ cell tumors are effectively treated with
combination chemotherapy; appropriate therapy may lead to cure.<Reference refidx="8"/>  The finding of germ cell tumors by genetic
analysis has been associated with a high response rate to cisplatin therapy,
thus suggesting that molecular or cytogenetic studies may be useful in
identifying undifferentiated tumors that are otherwise unclassifiable.<Reference refidx="9"/></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis:</Strong> In patients with suspected nasopharyngeal carcinoma, DNA amplification of
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes can be used for diagnosis with tissue provided
by fine-needle aspiration biopsy.  The presence of EBV in metastases from an
occult primary tumor suggests the development of overt nasopharyngeal
carcinoma.<Reference refidx="10"/>  A single study has shown that the i(12p) marker chromosome may
be used as a diagnostic tool in patients with suspected midline germ cell
tumors.<Reference refidx="11"/><Para id="_109">Another study used a molecular assay to evaluate ten tissue type–specific gene markers, using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR technology to detect tumors originating from the lung, breast, colon, ovary, pancreas, and prostate.  About 60% of patients had the putative site of origin identified, thus allowing for administration of treatment-specific therapy.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/></Para></ListItem><ListItem><Strong>Electron microscopic analysis:</Strong> Electron microscopy (EM) evaluation can sometimes aid in the diagnosis of CUP. 
In particular, the presence of desmosomes and bundles of tonofilaments are
characteristic of squamous cell cancers.  The presence of core granules that
are diagnostic of neuroendocrine origin is seen in poorly differentiated
neuroendocrine tumors of unknown primary site.<Reference refidx="14"/>
<Para id="_24">Acinar spaces and microacinic spaces are seen with adenocarcinomas.  Electron
dense secretory granules are seen in tumors of neuroectodermal origin. 
Premelanosomes can be found in most amelanotic melanomas.
</Para><Para id="_25">The features mentioned above are generally associated with differentiation
along a particular line.  Often poorly differentiated tumors do not display
such characteristics, making the EM evaluation of little value.  It is
estimated that EM may aid in distinguishing a primary diagnosis that has not
been obtained by light microscopy approximately 10% of the time.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/>
Because of the development of immunohistochemical stains, EM is rarely needed.</Para></ListItem></ItemizedList><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="3067982" MedlineID="89152328">Haskell CM, Cochran AJ, Barsky SH, et al.: Metastasis of unknown origin.

should be performed to determine the primary tumor in patients who present with
carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP).  Clinical and pathological investigations
to detect tumors that are potentially responsive to treatment (e.g., lymphoma,
germ cell tumor, breast, or ovarian tumor) may be undertaken.
</Para><Para id="_28">The chest radiograph has become an almost routine procedure in general medical
practice.  Although chest radiography is routinely performed, in the setting of
CUP no distinguishing feature clearly separates primary from
metastatic disease within the chest.  The abdominal computed tomographic (CT)
scan is the only radiographic test that may frequently be of value in defining
the primary site, because of the
inordinately high representation of pancreatic cancer in the CUP process.<Reference refidx="1"/> 
With the exception of ovarian cancer, however, CT scans rarely identify
treatable primary cancers.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/>
</Para><Para id="_29">The clinical biology of the disease, the types of tumors most often
encountered, and the high level of inaccuracy of unguided radiographic studies
raise issues of cost effectiveness for intensive diagnostic work-up.  Two
studies have indicated that a large negative cost/benefit ratio exists for an
extensive unguided clinical evaluation, with a single study citing a 9.5%
increase in 1-year survival at a cost of 2 to 8 million dollars.  The most
reasonable approach is to develop a comprehensive knowledge of the manner in
which CUP patients present and to remember that this presentation is associated
with tremendous heterogeneity regarding outcome.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/>
</Para><SummarySection id="_73"><Title>Cervical Lymph Nodes</Title><Para id="_31">A histologic diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma in cervical nodes requires a
meticulous examination of the upper aerorespiratory tract.  Histologically,
these tumors are usually squamous cell carcinoma, but occasionally may be adenocarcinoma, melanoma, or anaplastic
tumors.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma is generally associated with a poor
prognosis.  Approximately 2% to 5% of patients with primary squamous cell
carcinoma of the head and neck region will present with cervical adenopathy as
the primary disease manifestation; about 10% of this group will present with
bilateral adenopathy.  The 3-year survival rate ranges from 35% to 59% when

documented primary site.  Special stains and electron microscopy
may be important in establishing the diagnosis.  Patients with this diagnosis

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_76"><Title>Isolated Axillary Metastasis</Title><Para id="_39">Most patients who present with nodal metastasis above the diaphragm ultimately
are documented to have lung cancer, the most common supradiaphragmatic primary
malignancy.  The presence of isolated axillary metastasis in females, however,
raises another possibility.  A few studies involving a small number of patients
have shown that approximately 50% of patients who present with isolated
axillary metastasis of an adenocarcinoma will ultimately be shown to have
breast cancer.  Although some of these patients will have a positive mammogram
after the initial evaluation, approximately 50% of the patients will not. 
When these patients are treated with local excision, or as having primary
breast cancer, 2- to 10-year survival has been obtained in approximately 50% of
patients.  The availability of estrogen-receptor (ER) and progesterone-receptor
(PR) assays may aid in this diagnosis, and these studies should be performed in
this setting.  If the clinical setting is consistent with breast cancer, and ER
and/or PR levels are elevated, CUP with this distribution should be treated as
breast cancer.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="20"/>  (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062787" url="/types/breast/hp/breast-treatment-pdq">Breast Cancer Treatment</SummaryRef> for more

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_77"><Title>Inguinal Node Metastasis</Title><Para id="_41">Squamous carcinoma detected in the inguinal lymph nodes is almost always
metastatic from the genital or anal/rectal area.  In females, careful
examination of the vulva, vagina, and cervix is indicated, with biopsy of any
suspicious areas.  The penis of uncircumcised males should be carefully
inspected.  In both sexes, the anorectal area should be carefully examined,
including biopsy of suspicious areas.  Isolated metastases present in the
central nervous system, the liver, and the genitourinary tract.  Information
about these presentations may be found in PDQ summaries that specifically
detail their management.
</Para></SummarySection><Para id="_42">In addition to the above situations, significant palliation can be achieved in certain instances in patients with CUP.  Breast, prostate,
ovarian, and thyroid cancers are all treatable malignancies, even when
metastatic, and they represent approximately 15% of all CUP tumors.  As with
other CUP presentations, the pattern of spread of these malignancies is
somewhat atypical.  For instance, patients with prostate cancer who present
with CUP have an inordinately high incidence of metastases to nonosseous sites
such as lung (75%), liver (50%), and brain (25%).  Bone metastases are also
less common than lung metastases in thyroid cancer presenting as CUP.
