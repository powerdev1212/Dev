or more peripheral blood cytopenias.  MDS are diagnosed in slightly more than 10,000 people in the United States yearly, for an annual age-adjusted incidence rate of approximately 4.4 to 4.6 cases per 100,000 people.<Reference refidx="1"/> They are more common in men and whites. The
syndromes may arise de novo or secondarily after treatment with chemotherapy
and/or radiation therapy for other cancers or, rarely, after environmental exposures.    </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_293"><Title>Prognosis</Title><Para id="_294">Prognosis is directly
related to the number of bone marrow blast cells, to certain cytogenetic abnormalities, and to the amount of
peripheral blood cytopenias.  By convention, MDS are reclassified as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with myelodysplastic features when blood or bone marrow blasts reach or exceed 20%.   Many patients succumb to complications of cytopenias before progression to this stage.    (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062929#_7" url="/types/myeloproliferative/hp/myelodysplastic-treatment-pdq">Pathologic and Prognostic Systems for Myelodysplastic Syndromes</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more
information.)  The acute leukemic phase is less responsive to
chemotherapy than is de novo AML.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_295"><Title>Pathology</Title><Para id="_296">MDS are characterized by abnormal bone marrow and blood cell morphology. 
Megaloblastoid erythroid hyperplasia with macrocytic anemia, associated with
normal vitamin B<Subscript>12</Subscript> and folate levels, is frequently observed.  Circulating granulocytes
are often hypogranular or hypergranular, and may display the
acquired pseudo-Pelger-Huët abnormality.  Early, abnormal myeloid progenitors
are identified in the marrow in varying percentages.  Abnormally small megakaryocytes
(micromegakaryocytes) may be seen in the marrow and hypogranular or giant
platelets may appear in the blood.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_297"><Title>Clinical Features</Title><Para id="_298">MDS occur predominantly in older patients (usually those older than 60 years),
with a median age at diagnosis of approximately 70 years,<Reference refidx="2"/> although patients as young as 2 years have been reported.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Anemia, bleeding,
easy bruising, and fatigue are common initial findings. (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062734" url="/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/fatigue/fatigue-hp-pdq">Fatigue</SummaryRef> for more information.)  Splenomegaly or
hepatosplenomegaly may indicate an overlapping myeloproliferative neoplasm.  Approximately 50% of patients have a detectable cytogenetic abnormality, most commonly a deletion of all
or part of chromosome 5 or 7, or trisomy 8. Single-nucleotide polymorphism array technology may increase the detection of genetic abnormalities to 80%.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/>  Although the bone marrow is
usually hypercellular at diagnosis, 10% of patients present with a
hypoplastic bone marrow.<Reference refidx="6"/>  Hypoplastic myelodysplastic patients tend to have
profound cytopenias and may respond more frequently to immunosuppressive therapy.

megaloblastoid erythroid hyperplasia is present.  Dysplasia is usually
minimal.  Marrow blasts are less than 5%, and no peripheral blasts are present. Macrocytic anemia with reticulocytopenia is present in the blood. Transformation to acute leukemia is rare, and median survival varies from 2 years to 5 years in most series.  RA accounts for 20% to 30% of all patients with MDS.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_207"><Title>Refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS)</Title><Para id="_209">In patients with RARS, the blood and marrow are identical to those in patients with RA, except that
at least 15% of marrow red cell precursors are ring sideroblasts.  Approximately 10% to 12% of patients present with this type, and prognosis is identical to that of RA. Approximately 1% to 2% of RARS evolve to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_210"><Title>Refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB)</Title><Para id="_212">In patients with RAEB, there is significant evidence of disordered myelopoiesis and megakaryocytopoiesis in addition to abnormal erythropoiesis.  Because of  differences in prognosis related to progression to a frank AML, this cellular classification is composed of two categories: RAEB-1 and RAEB-2. Combined, the two categories account for approximately 40% of all patients with MDS.  RAEB-1 is characterized by 5% to 9% blasts in the bone marrow and less than 5% blasts in the blood.  Approximately 25% of cases of RAEB-1 progress to AML.  Median survival is approximately 18 months.  RAEB-2 is characterized by 10% to 19% blasts in the bone marrow.  Approximately 33% of cases of RAEB-2 progress to AML.  Median survival for RAEB-2 is approximately 10 months. </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_215"><Title>Refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD)</Title><Para id="_85">In patients with RCMD, bicytopenia or pancytopenia is present.  In addition, dysplastic changes are present in 10% or more of the cells in two or more myeloid cell lines.  There are less than 1% blasts in the blood and less than 5% blasts in the bone marrow.  Auer rods are not present.  Monocytes in the blood are less than 1 × 10<Superscript>9</Superscript>.  RCMD accounts for approximately 24% of cases of MDS.  The frequency of evolution to acute leukemia is 11%.  The overall median survival is 33 months.  Refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS) represents another category of RCMD.  In RCMD-RS, features of RCMD are present, and more than 15% of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow are ring sideroblasts.  RCMD-RS accounts for approximately 15% of cases of MDS.  Survival in RCMD-RS is similar to that in primary RCMD.
