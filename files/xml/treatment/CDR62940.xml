the first definitions included certain opportunistic infections, Kaposi
sarcoma, and central nervous system (CNS) lymphomas.    
In 1984, a multicenter
study described the clinical spectrum of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) in the
populations at risk for AIDS.<Reference refidx="1"/>  In 1985 and 1987, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) revised the definition of AIDS to include human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV)-infected patients who had aggressive B-cell NHL. 
The incidence of NHL has increased in an almost parallel
course with the AIDS epidemic and accounts for 2% to 3% of newly diagnosed AIDS
cases.<Reference refidx="2"/>  
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_152"><Title>Histology</Title><Para id="_3">Pathologically, AIDS-related lymphomas are comprised of a narrow spectrum of
histologic types consisting almost exclusively of B-cell tumors of aggressive
type.  These include the following:

noncleaved lymphoma, either Burkitt or Burkitt-like.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_61">The HIV-associated lymphomas

sarcoma-associated herpes-virus/human herpes virus type-8 (KSHV/HHV-8).<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/> 
Primary effusion lymphoma presents as a liquid phase spreading along serous membranes in the absence of masses or adenopathy.<Reference refidx="3"/> In addition to HHV-8, many cases are also associated with Epstein-Barr virus.  Extension of lymphoma from the effusion to underlying tissue may occur.  Plasmablastic multicentric Castleman disease is also associated with a coinfection of KSHV/HHV-8 and HIV.<Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/> Patients typically present with fever, night sweats, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly.  Patients may progress to primary effusion lymphoma or to plasmablastic or anaplastic large cell lymphoma.  Anecdotal responses to rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, have been reported.<Reference refidx="5"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000587991">Level of evidence: 3iiiDiv</LOERef>]</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_154"><Title>Incidence and Prevention</Title><Para id="_4">An international database of 48,000 HIV-seropositive individuals from the
United States, Europe, and Australia found a 42% decline in the incidence of 
NHLs from 1997 to 1999 compared with 1992 to 1996, both for
PCNSL and for systemic lymphoma.<Reference refidx="7"/>  The introduction of highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is the proposed explanation for this decline.<Reference refidx="8"/>  The diagnosis of AIDS precedes the onset of
NHL in approximately 57% of the patients, but in 30% of the patients the
diagnosis of AIDS is made at the time of the diagnosis of NHL and HIV positivity.<Reference refidx="9"/>  The geographic distribution of these lymphomas
is also similar to the geographic spread of AIDS.  Unlike Kaposi sarcoma,
which has a predilection for homosexual men and appears to be on the decline in
incidence, all risk groups appear to have an excess number of NHLs; these risk groups include intravenous drug users and children of
HIV-positive individuals.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_155"><Title>Clinical Presentation</Title><Para id="_116">In general, the clinical setting and response to treatment of patients with
AIDS-related lymphoma is very different from that of the non-HIV patients with
lymphoma.  The HIV-infected individual with aggressive lymphoma usually
presents with advanced-stage disease that is frequently extranodal.<Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_117">Common extranodal sites include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_118" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Bone marrow.</ListItem><ListItem>Liver.</ListItem><ListItem>Meninges.</ListItem><ListItem>Gastrointestinal tract.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_119">Very unusual sites are also characteristic and include the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_120" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Anus.</ListItem><ListItem>Heart.</ListItem><ListItem>Bile duct.</ListItem><ListItem>Gingiva.</ListItem><ListItem>Muscles.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_5"> 
  The clinical course is
more aggressive, and the disease is both more extensive and less responsive to
chemotherapy.  Immunodeficiency and cytopenias, common in these patients at the
time of initial presentation, are exacerbated by the administration of
chemotherapy.  Treatment of the malignancy increases the risk of
opportunistic infections that, in turn, further compromise the delivery of
adequate treatment.
</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_156"><Title>Prognosis and Survival</Title><Para id="_121">Prognoses of patients with AIDS-related lymphoma have been associated with the following:<Reference refidx="11"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_122" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Stage (i.e., extent of disease, extranodal involvement, lactate dehydrogenase level, and bone marrow involvement).</ListItem><ListItem>Age.</ListItem><ListItem>Severity of the underlying immunodeficiency (measured by CD4 lymphocyte count

PCNSL appear to have more severe underlying HIV-related disease
than do patients with systemic lymphoma.  In one report, this severity was
evidenced by patients with PCNSL having a higher incidence of 
prior AIDS diagnoses (73% vs. 37%), lower median number of CD4 lymphocytes
(30/dL vs. 189/dL), and a worse median survival time (2.5 months vs. 6.0
months).<Reference refidx="12"/>  This report also showed that patients with poor risk factors—defined as Karnofsky performance status less than 70%, history of prior AIDS
diagnosis, and bone marrow involvement—had a median survival time of 4.0
months compared with a good prognosis group without any of these risk factors,
who had a median survival time of 11.3 months.  </Para><Para id="_67">In another report (NIAID-ACTG-142), prognostic
factors were evaluated in a group of 192 patients with newly diagnosed
AIDS-related lymphoma who were randomly assigned to receive either low-dose
methotrexate, bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and
dexamethasone (m-BACOD) or standard dose m-BACOD with granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor.<Reference refidx="13"/>  No differences existed between these two 
treatments in terms of efficacy for disease-free survival, median survival, or
risk ratio for death.<Reference refidx="13"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335125">Level of evidence: 1iiA</LOERef>]  On multivariate analysis,
factors associated with decreased survival included age older than 35 years,
history of intravenous drug use, stage III or stage IV disease, and CD4 counts of
less than 100 cells/mm<Superscript>3</Superscript>.  The median survival rates were 46
weeks for patients with one or no risk factors, 44 weeks for patients with two risk
factors, and 18 weeks for patients with three or more risk factors.  The
International Prognostic Index may also be predictive for survival.<Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/>
In a multicenter cohort study of 203 patients, in a multivariable Cox model, response to HAART was independently associated with prolonged survival (relative hazard =  0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.16–0.62).<Reference refidx="17"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335155">Level of evidence: 3iiiDii</LOERef>]</Para><SummarySection id="_7"><Para id="_86"><Strong>HIV-associated Hodgkin lymphoma</Strong></Para><Para id="_8">Multiple reviews  of Hodgkin lymphoma occurring in patients
at risk for AIDS have been done;<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/>  however, Hodgkin lymphoma is still
not part of the CDC definition of AIDS because of no clear
demonstration of its increased incidence in conjunction with HIV, as is the
case for aggressive NHL.  The CDC, in conjunction with the
San Francisco Department of Public Health, has reported a cohort study in which
HIV-infected men had an excess risk that was attributable to the HIV infection
of 19.3 cases of Hodgkin lymphoma per 100,000 person-years and 224.9 cases of
NHL per 100,000 person-years.  Although an excess incidence
of Hodgkin lymphoma was found in HIV-infected homosexual men in this report,
additional epidemiologic studies will be needed before the CDC will reconsider
Hodgkin lymphoma as an HIV-associated malignancy.<Reference refidx="20"/>

extranodal or bone marrow involvement.<Reference refidx="18"/><Reference refidx="19"/><Reference refidx="21"/>  A distinctive feature of
HIV-associated Hodgkin lymphoma is the lower frequency of mediastinal
adenopathy compared with non-HIV-associated Hodgkin lymphoma.  Most patients in

less.<Reference refidx="22"/>

does not appear to have a direct etiologic role, HIV infection does lead to an
altered immunologic milieu.  HIV generally infects T lymphocytes whose loss of
regulation function leads to hypergammaglobulinemia and polyclonal B-cell
hyperplasia.  B cells are not the targets of HIV infection.  Instead,
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is thought to be at least a cofactor in the etiology
of some of these lymphomas.  The EBV genome has been detected in varying
numbers of patients with AIDS-related lymphomas; molecular analysis suggests
that the cells were infected before clonal proliferation began.<Reference refidx="1"/>  EBV is
detected in 30% of patients with small, noncleaved lymphomas and in 80% of patients with
diffuse, large cell lymphomas.  The rare,  primary effusion lymphoma consistently
harbors human herpes virus type-8 and frequently contains EBV.<Reference refidx="2"/>  HIV-related T-cell
lymphomas have also been identified and appear to be associated with EBV
infection.<Reference refidx="3"/>

disease.  PCNSL has increased dramatically in
association with AIDS.<Reference refidx="1"/>  PCNSL accounts for approximately 0.6% of initial AIDS diagnoses and is the
second most frequent central nervous system (CNS) mass lesion in adults with AIDS.  As with other
AIDS-related lymphomas, these are usually aggressive B-cell neoplasms, either
diffuse large cell or diffuse immunoblastic non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  Unlike AIDS-related systemic lymphomas, in which 30% to 50% of tumors are
associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), AIDS-related PCNSL has
been reported to have a 100% association with EBV.<Reference refidx="2"/>  This percentage
indicates a pathogenetic role for EBV in this disease.  These patients usually
have evidence of far-advanced AIDS, are severely debilitated, and present with
focal neurologic symptoms such as seizures, changes in mental status, and
paralysis.  
</Para><Para id="_42">Computed tomographic scans show contrast-enhancing mass lesions that may not
always be distinguished from other CNS diseases, such as toxoplasmosis, that
occur in AIDS patients.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Magnetic resonance imaging studies using gadolinium
contrast may be a more useful initial diagnostic tool in differentiating
lymphoma from cerebral toxoplasmosis or progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy.  Lymphoma tends to present with large lesions, which are
enhanced by gadolinium.  In cerebral toxoplasmosis, ring enhancement is very
common, lesions tend to be smaller, and multiple lesions are seen.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/>  Use of
positron emission scanning has demonstrated an improved ability to distinguish
PCNSL from toxoplasmosis.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/>  </Para><Para id="_131">PSNCL
has an increased uptake while toxoplasmosis lesions are metabolically inactive. 
Antibodies against toxoplasmosis may also be very useful because the vast
majority of cerebral toxoplasmosis occur as a consequence of reactivity of a
previous infection.  If the IgG titer is less than 1:4, the disease is unlikely
to be toxoplasmotic.  A lumbar puncture may be useful to detect  as many as 23%
of patients with malignant cells in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). 
Evaluating the CSF for EBV DNA may be a useful lymphoma-specific tool since EBV
is present in all patients with PCNSL.  Despite all of these evaluations,
however, the majority of patients with PCNSL require a pathologic
diagnosis.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/>  Diagnosis is made by biopsy.  Sometimes, a biopsy is
attempted only after failure of antibiotics for toxoplasmosis, which will
produce clinical and radiographic improvement within 1 to 3 weeks in patients
with cerebral toxoplasmosis.<Reference refidx="12"/>  PCNSL is often identified as a
terminal manifestation of AIDS or on postmortem examination.</Para><Para id="_43">Radiation therapy alone has usually been used in this group of patients.  With
doses in the 35 Gy to 40 Gy range, median duration of survival has been only
72 to 119 days.<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/>  Survival is longer in younger patients with better
performance status and the absence of opportunistic infection.<Reference refidx="15"/>  Most patients
respond to treatment by showing partial improvement in neurologic symptoms. 
Autopsies have revealed that these patients die of opportunistic infections as
well as tumor progression.  Treatment of these patients is also complicated by
other AIDS-related CNS infections, including subacute AIDS encephalitis,
cytomegalovirus encephalitis, and toxoplasmosis encephalitis.  Spontaneous
remissions have been reported after highly active antiretroviral therapy.<Reference refidx="16"/>
