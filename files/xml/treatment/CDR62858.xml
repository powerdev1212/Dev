the main focus is on the effect of smoking on recurrence or on diagnosis of a
second primary cancer; patterns of quitting and continued smoking in cancer
patients; and recommendations for smoking intervention for cancer patients.
This information will assist health professionals caring for patients during and after treatment.  Substantial material on cancer prevention and smoking cessation in the general
population is available elsewhere.  Because virtually all the available
evidence pertains to cigarettes rather than other forms of tobacco, such as snuff
or chewing tobacco, reference is made to smoking cigarettes rather than to tobacco
use.</Para><Para id="_1_4">In this summary, unless otherwise stated, evidence and practice issues as they relate to adults are discussed.  The evidence and application to practice related to children may differ significantly from information related to adults.  When specific information about the care of children is available, it is summarized under its own heading.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_3"><Title>Smoking as a Primary Risk Factor</Title><Para id="_4">The relationships between tobacco use and cancers of the lung and head and neck
have been established for almost 50 years.  Of the estimated 53,000 cases
of head and neck cancer diagnosed each year, 85% are associated with tobacco
use.  The relative attributable risk of morbidity from smoking for lung cancer
is more than 90%; it is between 60% and 70% for other smoking-related cancers
(larynx, oral cavity, esophagus, bladder, kidney, pancreas, and other urinary
cancers).<Reference refidx="1"/>  Evidence suggests that smoking before age 30 years is a strong
risk factor for colorectal cancer, with the risk appearing after a very long induction
period (&gt;35 years) in both men <Reference refidx="2"/> and women.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_119">Smokers may also be at increased risk of regional and metastatic disease at diagnosis.<Reference refidx="4"/>   In one study, smoking worsened the course or outcome of acute myeloid leukemia, particularly in younger patients  and those with unfavorable karyotypes.<Reference refidx="5"/> A study of renal cell carcinoma patients suggests that improvement in renal cell carcinoma risk  after smoking cessation may be relatively linear but may take more than 20 years to reduce risk  to that of a nonsmoker.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para><Para id="_120">Smoking contributes to cancer
development by causing mutations in tumor suppressor genes and dominant
oncogenes and by impairing mucociliary clearance in the lungs and decreasing
immunologic response.<Reference refidx="7"/>  (Refer to the PDQ summary  on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062824" url="/types/lung/hp/lung-prevention-pdq">Lung Cancer Prevention</SummaryRef> for more information.)</Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Shopland DR, Burns DM, Garfinkel L, et al.: Monograph 8: Changes in Cigarette-Related Disease Risks and Their Implications for Prevention and Control.

medical advantage to an individual quitting smoking once cancer is diagnosed.  There is substantial
evidence that continued smoking may reduce the effectiveness of treatment and
increase the likelihood of a second cancer.  (Refer to the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062858#_9" url="/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/tobacco/smoking-cessation-hp-pdq">Smoking as a Risk Factor for Second Malignancy</SummaryRef> section of this summary for more  information.)  Continued smoking may also worsen
side effects of treatment,<Reference refidx="1"/> although the direct evidence for this is
surprisingly limited because few studies have evaluated this issue.</Para><Para id="_115">If one
extrapolates from the extensive evidence of the effects of smoking on
cardiovascular disease, pulmonary functioning, immunosuppression, and wound
healing due to vasoconstriction and the fairly rapid reduction of some effects
after smoking cessation,<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/> these results might also apply to cancer
patients, particularly if surgical management or lung functioning is involved.
For example, one study outlined a model of cardiopulmonary toxicities in
response to various antineoplastic therapies that may be potentiated by tobacco
use. More specifically, smokers treated with bleomycin or carmustine showed
higher levels of pulmonary fibrosis and restrictive lung disease, and the
anthracyclines led to higher risk of cardiomyopathy in smokers.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_124">In a
study of patients with advanced head and neck cancer who underwent radiation therapy,<Reference refidx="5"/>
patients who continued to smoke during radiation therapy suffered mucositis for a longer 
time (23.4 weeks) than did patients who quit at the time of radiation
therapy and remained abstinent (13.6 weeks) or patients who remained abstinent for at
least a month after treatment (18.3 weeks).  Extended mucositis may be associated
with permanent alteration in appearance.  Studies show that perioperative and long-term complications are considerably higher in patients with head and neck cancer who continue to smoke.<Reference refidx="6"/> In one study, patients receiving induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia who continued to smoke were more likely to experience severe pulmonary infection (26% vs. 18%), although overall survival rates did not differ in  adults older than 60 years.<Reference refidx="7"/> After radiation therapy for
laryngeal carcinoma, patients who continue to smoke may be less likely to
regain satisfactory voice quality.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_116">Another area of reasonable concern for
patients who continue to smoke is the rate of general complications
 after any type of surgery. It is documented that wound healing postsurgery is slowed in smokers because both nicotine and carbon monoxide cause
vasoconstriction, inhibition of epithelization, and creation of cellular
hypoxia.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/>  In one study of predictors of complications after resection
in lung cancer patients, a history of smoking doubled the likelihood of
complications, but smoking at the time of admission for surgery did not.<Reference refidx="11"/>  However, no
detailed information on the time since smoking
had ceased was provided.</Para><Para id="_7">One study found decreased response rates and survival rates in patients with head and neck
cancer who continued to smoke during treatment.  Patients who continued to smoke had a
significantly lower rate of complete response to radiation therapy (45% vs.
74%) and 2-year survival (39% vs. 66%).  Recent quitters were more similar to
long-term quitters than to continued smokers in survival likelihood at 18
months.<Reference refidx="12"/></Para><Para id="_8">Another study also showed an effect of continued smoking on survival rates in
patients with head and neck cancer.<Reference refidx="13"/>  Those who stopped
smoking doubled their chance of survival, irrespective of extent of disease at
diagnosis; after 2 years, survival of quitters approached that of
nonsmokers.  Relative risk of recurrence in quitters was about double that of nonsmokers; in those who continued to smoke after diagnosis, relative risk of recurrence quadrupled, regardless of the amount they
smoked.  One study failed to find significant differences in prognosis in
resected stage I non-small cell lung cancer patients on the basis of smoking
status; the recurrence and death rates in both former and current smokers did
not differ but were double to triple the rates in newer smokers.<Reference refidx="14"/>  These
differences failed, however, to reach statistical significance because of the small
number of newer smokers; in addition, the lack of differences between former versus current
smokers was hard to interpret because no definitions were provided.</Para><Para id="_121">In another study, a
consistent trend was found in patients with small cell cancer: continued smokers had the
poorest survival, followed by patients who quit at diagnosis, then by
patients who had quit on average 2.5 years before diagnosis.<Reference refidx="15"/>  Although
survival curves of recent ex-smokers did not differ statistically from
continued smokers, perhaps because of small numbers, no continued smokers (n = 57)
survived past 131 weeks, whereas six of those who quit at diagnosis (n = 35) were
in complete remission at 1 and 2 years.</Para><Para id="_122">  The relationships between smoking, disease recurrence, and mortality rates for prostate cancer have been examined.  Studies have found an association between continued smoking and earlier recurrence <Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/> and increased mortality.<Reference refidx="18"/>  In a study of 1,416 men who underwent radical prostatectomy, recurrence occurred after a mean of 7.3 years in 34.3% of current smokers, 14.8% of former smokers, and 12.1% of those who had never smoked.<Reference refidx="17"/> Another study found higher 5-year mortality rates in patients with stage D2 disease (88% vs. 63%) and non–stage A disease (39% vs. 17%).<Reference refidx="16"/>  In a prospective observational study of 5,366 men, prostate cancer–specific death rates  were 15.3 per 1,000 person-years for current smokers versus 9.6 per 1,000 person-years for those who had never smoked.  Prostate cancer patients who quit smoking for 10  years or longer had mortality rates similar to those of nonsmokers.<Reference refidx="18"/></Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="1622882" MedlineID="92322555">Des Rochers C, Dische S, Saunders MI: The problem of cigarette smoking in radiotherapy for cancer in the head and neck.

another site if they continue to smoke.<Reference refidx="1"/><Reference refidx="2"/>  When prognosis is more favorable
for the initial cancer, the evidence is even stronger that continued smoking
increases the risk of new primary cancers for up to 20 years after original
diagnosis.  In two studies of survivors of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (mostly
stage I and II),<Reference refidx="3"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/> risk of a second cancer (mostly non-SCLC [NSCLC]) was 3.5-fold to 4.4-fold higher than in the general population.  In those who
continued to smoke, the risk was far higher, particularly in those who also received
chest irradiation (relative risk [RR] = 21.0) and alkylating agents (RR = 19.0).<Reference refidx="4"/> 
In individuals who stopped smoking at the time of diagnosis, the risk was no
higher than in those who had stopped smoking at least 6 months before
diagnosis.</Para><Para id="_117">In a study of breast cancer survivors who subsequently developed lung cancer,<Reference refidx="6"/>    the risk of subsequent lung cancer in those who were treated with thoracic radiation therapy (XRT) alone was negligible, whereas the risk attributable to smoking was substantial (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 5.6) and even higher for a combination of XRT and smoking (unadjusted OR = 9.0, <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .05; adjusted OR = 8.6, <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .08).  Even higher multiplicative risk of subsequent lung cancer from radiation treatment and smoking (RR = 20.2) was identified in a study of  Hodgkin lymphoma survivors,<Reference refidx="7"/>  which found  higher multiplicative effects (RR = 49.1) for a combination of radiation and alkylating agents in moderate to heavy smokers  compared with other cases. Another study in Japan confirmed that patients with SCLC who
survive at least 2 years greatly reduced their likelihood of a second cancer if
they quit smoking.<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_11">Patients with oral and pharyngeal cancers who smoke also have an exceptionally
high rate of second primary cancers. A follow-up study of more than 1,000 patients
with oral cancers found that the risk of a second cancer increased with
continued smoking up to almost five times as much (OR = 4.7) for all
aerodigestive cancers among long-term heavy smokers (two packs or more per day), even
after controlling for alcohol, which carries its own excess risk. No effect was
seen for quitting within 2 years, but risk decreased significantly after 5
years' cessation.<Reference refidx="9"/>
 Another study <Reference refidx="10"/> confirmed this increased risk, although at a somewhat lower level.  More than 1,000 patients with early-stage head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were examined for the joint effects of tobacco and alcohol exposure on second primary tumors (SPT) up to 6 years after initial diagnosis.  SPT cases were more likely to be current smokers (27.5% vs. 18.8%) who smoked more for a longer period and  used forms of tobacco other than cigarettes or in combination with cigarettes. Overall risk of  SPT was  approximately double for smokers.  Most increased risk was associated with continued smoking (RR = 2.1) and alcohol intake (RR = 1.3) after diagnosis, although no interaction effect was evident.</Para><Para id="_12">The relationship between smoking and progression of prostate cancer has been documented.  One study found a much higher 5-year tumor-specific mortality
rate among smokers with stage D2 disease (88% vs. 63%) or non–stage A disease
(39% vs. 17%), which was attributed to immunosuppressive effects of continued
smoking.<Reference refidx="11"/>  The impact of smoking on risk of a secondary lung cancer
has been demonstrated in survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma.<Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="12"/> Studies conducted in patients with primary cancers have also shown decreased risk of second malignancy and improved survival as a result of smoking cessation.<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/></Para><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="16311986">Gritz ER, Fingeret MC, Vidrine DJ, et al.: Successes and failures of the teachable moment: smoking cessation in cancer patients.

conducted with cancer patients.  Many patients report quitting smoking at the time of diagnosis, and many others have comorbidities that prevent enrollment in clinical trials, yet little is known about routine smoking cessation services in an oncology setting.  Thus, a smoking cessation feasibility study reported on implementation issues.<Reference refidx="1"/>  In this study, 14,514 adult cancer patients were screened as potential participants, with fewer than 2% of patients determined to be eligible.   Barriers to enrollment and exclusion criteria included the following:</Para><ItemizedList id="_106" Style="bullet"><ListItem>Nonsmoker status (83%).</ListItem><ListItem>Contraindicated medical history (e.g., serious cardiovascular problem) (5%).</ListItem><ListItem>Not interested in quitting smoking (4%).</ListItem><ListItem>Current psychiatric condition (e.g., alcohol dependence, any Axis I disorder) (0.1%).</ListItem><ListItem>Other (e.g., unreachable by phone, too far to travel, died, non-English speaker, current medication contraindicated) (7.2%).</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_107">Eighty-four percent of eligible patients enrolled.  Patients who declined enrollment were more likely than those who enrolled to have advanced disease.  Patients who enrolled had extensive smoking histories (mean, 38 years), scored very high on measures of nicotine dependence, and averaged about seven drinks per week; about one-quarter of enrollees reported clinical levels of depressive symptoms.  Researchers concluded that integrating a smoking cessation program into routine clinical care is feasible, although challenging, and that particular attention should be given to the subpopulation of smokers who also experience depression.<Reference refidx="1"/> Other studies also suggest lower cessation rates in patients with depression and alcohol use disorders.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_16">Another study found that when consistent intervention was provided to a
group of patients with head and neck cancer, about 65% were able to quit and remain
abstinent, including about one-half of patients who expressed little interest in
quitting at baseline.<Reference refidx="4"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]  A large intervention study with head and neck cancer
patients used surgeon- or dentist-delivered advice to stop smoking, contracted
quit dates, written materials, and booster advice sessions.  Partially because of a
high drop-out rate, a significant intervention effect was not detected,
although differences were in the expected direction.<Reference refidx="4"/>
A similar study  <Reference refidx="5"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>] also failed to find beneficial effects for very brief (&lt;5 minutes) physician-delivered interventions based on the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062858#_32" url="/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/tobacco/smoking-cessation-hp-pdq">Ask, Advise, Assist, Arrange</SummaryRef> model outlined below.  More than 400 cancer patients with a range of diagnoses were randomly assigned to receive either intervention or usual care.  Approximately one-half had been diagnosed within the previous 6 months; 46.3% had tried to quit in the previous 6 months; and 84% were considering quitting in the following 6 months.  Patients randomly assigned to the intervention group acknowledged receiving advice and resources from their physician consistent with the protocol; however, there were no significant differences in quit rates at either 6-month follow-up (11.9% vs. 14.4%)  or 12-month follow-up (13.6% vs. 13.3%).  Patients were  more likely to  quit smoking if they had been diagnosed with head and  neck cancer or lung cancer, were lighter smokers, expressed a strong desire to quit, and used additional intervention resources.  These results suggest that very brief physician counseling for this high-risk group is not adequate to improve quit rates.</Para><Para id="_73">A case-controlled retrospective study <Reference refidx="6"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663087">Level of evidence: III</LOERef>] examined the effects of referral to a nicotine dependence center for more than 200 smokers diagnosed with lung cancer compared with smokers without a lung cancer diagnosis.  Most lung cancer patients were less likely to have made previous attempts to quit smoking but expressed higher motivation to quit than did individuals without lung cancer.  Although the likelihood of being abstinent at 6 months postintervention was higher among lung cancer patients (22% vs. 14%), after adjusting for demographic variables and level of motivation, there was no statistically significant difference.  Patients who were closer to diagnosis at the time of intervention were far more likely to be abstinent at 6 months (27.3% vs. 0% for 3–6 months vs. 7% for  &gt;6 months, <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .01).  In general, a brief smoking intervention consisting of approximately 1 hour of tailored intervention, including prescription of pharmacologic treatment, showed relatively little impact in this high-risk population.  However, referral sooner after diagnosis may increase the likelihood of quitting.  This study is limited by the self-selection of patients and lack of a nonintervention comparison group.</Para><Para id="_17">Considerable work has been done, however, with other patient groups—particularly cardiac patients—in establishing the valuable role of
physicians and other health care providers in providing smoking intervention in
the context of medical care.  Specific recommendations for intervening in
tobacco use have been published in several contexts.  On the basis of outcomes from six
major clinical trials of physician-delivered smoking intervention conducted in
the late 1980s,<Reference refidx="7"/> the Ask, Advise, Assist, Arrange model was developed. In this model, the physician provides a brief intervention that entails asking about
smoking status at every visit, advising abstinence, assisting by setting a quit
date, providing self-help materials, recommending the use of nicotine
replacement therapy, and arranging for a follow-up visit.  See the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062858#_32" url="/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/tobacco/smoking-cessation-hp-pdq">list below</SummaryRef> for
brief and expanded intervention outlines.  The <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062858#_39" url="/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/tobacco/smoking-cessation-hp-pdq">Patient-Centered Counseling Key Elements</SummaryRef> list below provides detailed questions
that may be asked in the assist phase in a patient-centered counseling format
that is brief enough (5–7 minutes) to be delivered within the context of a
usual office visit.<Reference refidx="8"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]</Para><Para id="_18">These recommendations form the core of the Public Health Service–sponsored Clinical Practice Guideline <Reference refidx="9"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663089">Level of evidence: IV</LOERef>];<Reference refidx="10"/>  that extended the recommendations by
strongly supporting the value of referral to more intensive counseling. 
Furthermore, in addition to the documented value of nicotine replacement
therapy (using gum, lozenge, patch, nasal spray,  or inhaler), there is now clear evidence
for the value of the antidepressant bupropion HCl (Wellbutrin SR  and Zyban), 150 mg twice a day, as an adjunct for treatment;<Reference refidx="11"/> however, these
adjunctive pharmacological treatments have not been tested in cancer patients. 
Individuals should be advised to check with their physicians.</Para><Para id="_19">Not all smokers are equally motivated to stop smoking.  One of the most useful
models for physicians in understanding the motivational issues in stopping
smoking and actually quitting is the Stages of Change Model.<Reference refidx="9"/>  Most individuals attempting to change a complex behavior such as smoking go through several
predictable stages, from precontemplation to contemplation to preparation
and, finally, to action.  One of the goals of brief physician counseling is to
move patients along these stages, until they are more motivated to quit.  In
addition, especially for first-time quitters, relapsing and cycling through
these stages one or more times is common, until the person develops better
behavioral skills.</Para><Para id="_123">The most common triggers for relapse are stressful
situations and social triggers for smoking.  One study found that the patterns
of relapse in head and neck cancer patients were comparable to patterns of relapse in quitters in the
general population.<Reference refidx="12"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663072">Level of evidence: II</LOERef>]  Smokers should be encouraged to anticipate such
situations and develop strategies for handling them, as part of developing a
new identity as a nonsmoker.  It may take more than a year for even
motivated smokers to successfully make these changes.  The Stages of Change
Model is well described and summarized <Reference refidx="9"/> and is outlined as part of the <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062858#_32" url="/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/tobacco/smoking-cessation-hp-pdq">Ask, Advise, Assist, Arrange Key Elements</SummaryRef> list below. 
Other important information such as smoking history (e.g., amount smoked or
previous attempts to quit) can be efficiently collected by asking patients to
complete a brief set of self-assessment forms in the waiting room.  Nicotine
addiction can be assessed using the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), and
behavioral patterns (e.g., tendency to smoke when under stress) can be assessed
using the online booklet titled <ExternalRef xref="http://smokefree.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/clearing-the-air-accessible.pdf">Clearing the Air</ExternalRef>. When talking with patients about smoking cessation, providers can use a <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/2010/clinician_sheet/pdfs/clinician.pdf">fact sheet</ExternalRef> available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</Para><Para id="_166">Psychiatric disorders and alcohol abuse may be complicating factors in the treatment of smoking, regardless of the population. Smoking prevalence is notably higher among those with mental or alcohol disorders,<Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/> and response to treatment is poorer.<Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/></Para><Para id="_167">A comprehensive longitudinal study <Reference refidx="3"/> of all patients (N = 1,425) seen over a 3-year period at the MD Anderson Cancer Center Tobacco Treatment Program identified individuals with major depression (n = 194), an anxiety disorder (n = 53), alcohol abuse (n = 92), or combinations of these disorders (n = 255), with the remainder (n = 831) having no psychiatric diagnosis. Across groups, individuals smoked an average of one pack per day. Patients received an individually tailored behavioral intervention, generally consisting of an in-person initial evaluation and an average of eight treatment sessions over 3 to 4 months, either in person or by phone, with follow-up at 6 months. Smoking-related pharmacotherapy was part of treatment for 88% of participants; about 15% also received a consultation with the program's addiction psychiatrist.</Para><Para id="_170">Individuals with no psychiatric diagnosis had abstinence rates of 44% at the end of the program and 45.1% at 6 months. Abstinence rates for clinical groups at 6 months varied, as follows:<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_168" Style="bullet"><ListItem>30.2% for those with combined anxiety, depression, and alcohol abuse.</ListItem><ListItem>33.7% for those with alcohol abuse alone.</ListItem><ListItem>37.6% for those with major depression.</ListItem><ListItem>45.3% for those with only an anxiety disorder.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_169">Regardless of the diagnosis, the best predictor of extended abstinence was the FTND (overall average score, 4.9 [standard deviation, 2.2]; group range, 4.7 [no diagnosis] to 5.4 [major depression]). The overall conclusion is that in an intensive comprehensive program for cancer patients who are smokers, such as the program offered at MD Anderson, individuals with an anxiety disorder are likely to do as well as individuals without any diagnosis, but those with major depression or alcohol abuse may do more poorly, particularly if their FTND scores are higher.</Para><Para id="_20">Tailoring intervention for specific populations may also be important, 
although this has not been examined specifically in cancer patients. A study of
the effects of self-help intervention materials designed for an
African American population showed higher quit rates (25%) among those
who received the tailored materials than among those who received the standard
materials (15.4%) at 12 months postintervention.<Reference refidx="17"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]
</Para><Para id="_21">Other investigators have begun to examine intervention approaches specific to
patients at high risk of developing lung cancer, through the use of genetic
biomarker feedback (presence of the CYP2D6 genetic abnormality, which increases
the risk of developing lung cancer twofold to fourfold) in otherwise healthy smokers. 
Adding information on genetic risk of cancer to the usual counseling
approaches increased initial quit rates significantly, but this effect was not
maintained; such an approach may be a useful motivational component to add to
a more comprehensive intervention but may not be sufficient in itself.<Reference refidx="18"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]

Fluoxetine HCl (Prozac)
   has also been studied as a treatment for smoking cessation. All three of these treatments carry boxed warnings.</Para><SummarySection id="_181"><Title>Varenicline (Chantix)</Title><Para id="_182">Varenicline is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist and the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved prescription pharmacologic agent targeted to these nicotinic receptors.<Reference refidx="2"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000663069">Level of evidence: I</LOERef>]  Although specific mechanisms of action are unknown, it is thought that the agonist properties result in reduced craving and withdrawal by stimulating the release of dopamine and that the antagonist properties prevent inhaled nicotine from binding at the nicotinic receptor sites.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_183">At least 12 published randomized, controlled trials have evaluated varenicline versus placebo (or other approved agents for smoking cessation) for its ability to affect abstinence rates related to smoking or  the use of smokeless tobacco.<Reference refidx="2"/><Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/><Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/><Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/>  All studies were relatively large (129–607 patients per arm) and involved multiple sites and countries.  In all studies, varenicline was statistically better in achieving abstinence rates as assessed by self-report and carbon monoxide measures than was placebo, and was often better than the other approved smoking cessation comparator arm.  Abstinence rates at 12 weeks can be expected to range from 44% to 49% for varenicline versus 11% to 17% for placebo; longer-term rates (52 weeks) range from 14% to 22% for varenicline versus 4% to 8% for placebo.</Para><Para id="_184">Most studies evaluated varenicline 1 mg twice a day, using a 1-week titration of 0.5 mg daily for 3 days, 0.5 mg twice a day for 4 days, and then 1 mg twice a day for 11 weeks.  However, a few studies evaluated different doses, such as 0.3 mg or 0.5 mg daily or 0.5 mg twice a day, and one study evaluated a flexible dosing schedule during weeks 2 to 12 after all participants were titrated up to 1 mg twice a day in an open-label fashion.  From these data, varenicline 0.5 mg twice a day appears to be the minimum dose required to achieve statistically significantly better abstinence rates over placebo.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/></Para><Para id="_185">Most studies included healthy smokers, i.e., those without significant comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease or psychiatric disease.
