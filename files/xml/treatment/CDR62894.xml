often be cured if it is diagnosed and treated when still localized to the
kidney and to the immediately surrounding tissue.  The probability of cure is
directly related to the stage or degree of tumor dissemination.  Even when
regional lymphatics or blood vessels are involved with tumor, a significant
number of patients can achieve prolonged survival and probable cure.<Reference refidx="2"/>  When
distant metastases are present, disease-free survival is poor; however, 
occasional selected patients will survive after surgical resection of all known
tumor.  Because a majority of patients are diagnosed when the tumor is still
relatively localized and amenable to surgical removal, approximately 73% of all
patients with renal cell cancer survive for 5 years.<Reference refidx="3"/>  Occasionally, patients with locally
advanced or metastatic disease may exhibit indolent courses lasting several
years.  Late tumor recurrence many years after initial treatment also occasionally
occurs.
</Para><Para id="_3">Renal cell cancer is one of the few tumors in which well-documented cases of
spontaneous tumor regression in the absence of therapy exist, but this occurs
very rarely and may not lead to long-term survival.  </Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_305"><Title>Treatment Modalities</Title><Para id="_306">Surgical resection is the
mainstay of treatment of this disease.  Even in patients with disseminated
tumor, locoregional forms of therapy may play an important role in palliating
symptoms of the primary tumor or of ectopic hormone production.  Systemic
therapy has demonstrated only limited effectiveness.

of proximal tubular origin.  Most of the remainder are transitional cell
carcinomas of the renal pelvis. (Refer to the PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062937" url="/types/kidney/hp/transitional-cell-treatment-pdq">Transitional Cell
Cancer of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter Treatment</SummaryRef> for more information.) 
Adenocarcinomas may be separated into clear-cell and granular-cell carcinomas; however,  the two cell types may occur together in some tumors.  Some
investigators have found that granular-cell tumors have a worse prognosis, but
this finding is not universal.  Distinguishing  between well-differentiated
renal adenocarcinomas and renal adenomas can be difficult.  The diagnosis is
usually made arbitrarily on the basis of size of the mass, but size alone
should not influence the treatment approach, since metastases can occur with
lesions as small as 0.5 centimeter.

prognostic sign if the tumor is otherwise confined to the substance of the
kidney.  Abnormal liver function test results may be caused by a paraneoplastic
syndrome that is reversible with tumor removal, and these types of results do not necessarily represent
metastatic disease. Except when computed tomography (CT) examination is
equivocal or when iodinated contrast material is contraindicated, CT scanning
is as good as or better than magnetic resonance imaging for detecting
renal masses.<Reference refidx="4"/>

Interferon-alpha has approximately a 15%
objective response rate in appropriately selected individuals.<Reference refidx="11"/> In
general, these patients have nonbulky pulmonary and/or soft tissue metastases
with excellent PS ratings of zero or one, according to the ECOG rating scale,   and the patients show no weight loss.  The
interferon-alpha doses used in studies reporting good response rates have been
in an intermediate range (6–20 million units 3 times weekly).  A Cochrane analysis of six  randomized trials, with a total of 963 patients, indicated an HR for survival of 0.78 (CI, 0.67–0.90) or a weighted average improvement in survival of 2.6 months.<Reference refidx="11"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335125">Level of evidence: 1iiA</LOERef>] </Para><Para id="_182">High-dose IL-2 produces a similar overall response rate to interferon-alpha, but approximately 5% of patients had durable complete remissions.<Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/><Reference refidx="14"/><Reference refidx="15"/><Reference refidx="16"/><Reference refidx="17"/> IL-2 has never been shown in a randomized, controlled trial to result in longer survival.  High-dose IL-2 is used because it is the only systemic therapy that has been associated with inducing durable complete remissions, albeit in a small fraction (about 5%) of patients who are eligible for this treatment.   The optimum dose of IL-2 is unknown.  High-dose
therapy appears to be associated with higher response rates but with more toxic
effects.  Low-dose inpatient regimens have activity against renal cell carcinoma with fewer toxic
effects, especially hypotension, but have not been shown to be superior to placebo or any alternative regimen with regard to survival or quality of life.<Reference refidx="18"/>  Outpatient subcutaneous administration
has also demonstrated responses with acceptable toxic effects but, again, with unclear survival or quality of life benefit.<Reference refidx="19"/> Combinations of IL-2 and
interferon-alpha have been studied, but outcomes have not been better with

Several of these agents have been shown in randomized, controlled trials to significantly delay progression of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma, but none has resulted in a statistically significant increase in OS as conventionally assessed.  Many of these trials allowed crossover upon progression and, in some instances, other agents with similar biological activity were available to patients after they withdrew from the clinical trial.  These facts may have made it more difficult to detect an OS benefit.  For the clinician, this makes it challenging to determine the real benefit of these drugs to the patient.  The four FDA-approved anti-VEGF agents include three oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors: pazopanib, sorafenib, and sunitinib; and an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody, bevacizumab.

In other words, patients assigned to pazopanib first had a true 2-week break from treatment, and their drug preference was assessed at the peak period of toxic effects from sunitinib; however, the patients assigned to sunitinib first had no true treatment break before starting pazopanib and may have had less opportunity to recover from the side effects of sunitinib.</Para><Para id="_334">Despite these limitations, 70% of the patients preferred pazopanib, and 22% of the patients preferred sunitinib (<Emphasis>P</Emphasis> &lt; .001).
