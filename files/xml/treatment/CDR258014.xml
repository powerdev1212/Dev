There are two types of radiation therapy.  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046686">External radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef> uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046345">Internal radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef> uses a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046550">radioactive</GlossaryTermRef> substance sealed in needles, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000257219">seeds</GlossaryTermRef>, wires, or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045637">catheters</GlossaryTermRef> that are placed directly into or near the cancer.

The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language.

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
