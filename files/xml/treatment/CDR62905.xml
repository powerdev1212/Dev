These patients represent the majority of patients with bile duct cancer.  Often the
cancer invades directly into the portal vein, the adjacent liver or along the
common bile duct, and to adjacent lymph nodes.  Spread to distant parts of the
body is uncommon but intra-abdominal metastases, particularly peritoneal
metastases, do occur.  At this stage, patient management is directed at
palliation.
