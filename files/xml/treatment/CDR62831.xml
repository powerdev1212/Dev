injury to oneself or others.   People who have survived military combat, natural disasters, violent personal attack (such as rape), or other
life-threatening <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000450122">stress</GlossaryTermRef> may suffer from PTSD. The symptoms for  PTS and PTSD are a lot alike, but most cancer patients are able to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454700">cope</GlossaryTermRef> and don't develop full PTSD.

Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language.

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_AboutThis_10"><Title>Clinical Trial Information</Title><Para id="_AboutThis_11">A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
