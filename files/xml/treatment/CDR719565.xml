    <Question>What is green tea?</Question>
    <Answer>
     <Para id="_227">Tea has been consumed in Asia since ancient times. Sailors  first brought tea to  England in the 17th century. Other than water, tea is the most widely consumed beverage in the world.  Tea comes from the <ScientificName>Camellia sinensis</ScientificName> plant. The way the leaves of this plant  are processed determines the type of tea produced. </Para><Para id="_246">Many of the possible health benefits studied in green tea are thought to be from  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000422394">compounds</GlossaryTermRef> called <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000256573">polyphenols</GlossaryTermRef>. Polyphenols are a large group of plant chemicals that include <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000686469">catechins</GlossaryTermRef>         (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043997">antioxidants</GlossaryTermRef> that help protect <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046476">cells</GlossaryTermRef> from damage caused by <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044030">free radicals</GlossaryTermRef>).</Para><Para id="_248">Catechins make up most of the polyphenols in green tea. The most active catechin in green tea is <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000687212">epigallocatechin-3-gallate</GlossaryTermRef> (EGCG).</Para><Para id="_229">To make green tea, the tea leaves are roasted in a wok (or, historically, steamed) to preserve the catechins and retain freshness. Black tea is made using  a process that causes  the catechins and other compounds in the leaves to <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000654996">oxidize</GlossaryTermRef>, producing darker colored tea. Oolong tea is made from partially oxidized leaves.</Para><Para id="_226">Some studies suggest that green tea may protect against <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044005">cardiovascular</GlossaryTermRef> disease and some types of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045333">cancer</GlossaryTermRef>, including  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000445079">prostate cancer</GlossaryTermRef>. <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045961">Clinical trials</GlossaryTermRef> designed to study whether green tea is useful in treating prostate cancer are in the early stages. There is not enough evidence to show whether green tea  is effective in treating prostate cancer.</Para></Answer>

The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/espanol/recursos/pdq">Spanish</ExternalRef>.</Para><Para id="_AboutThis_4">PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research.  The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_AboutThis_5"><Title>Purpose of This Summary</Title><Para id="_AboutThis_6">This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the use of nutrition and dietary supplements for reducing the risk of developing prostate cancer or for treating prostate cancer.

</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_AboutThis_10"><Title>Clinical Trial Information</Title><Para id="_AboutThis_11">A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
</Para><Para id="_AboutThis_12">Clinical trials are listed in PDQ and can be found online at <ExternalRef xref="http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials">NCI's Web site</ExternalRef>.

  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_2"><Title>General CAM Information</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_3">Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also referred to as integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_4">Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_5">Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. </Para></SummarySection> 
  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_6"><Title>Evaluation of CAM Approaches</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_7">It is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute  and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_8">Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH)  in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.</Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_9"><ExternalRef xref="http://cam.cancer.gov/cam/best_case_intro.html">The NCI Best Case Series Program</ExternalRef>   which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM conducts a critical review of the materials and develops follow-up research strategies for approaches deemed to warrant NCI-initiated research.</Para></SummarySection>
