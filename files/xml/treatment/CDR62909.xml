This summary only covers the treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancers. (Refer to the  PDQ summary on <SummaryRef href="CDR0000062917" url="/types/skin/hp/melanoma-treatment-pdq">Melanoma Treatment</SummaryRef> for more information.)</Para><SummarySection id="_406"><Title>Incidence and Mortality</Title><Para id="_407">Nonmelanoma skin cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer in the United States. BCC is the more common type of the two nonmelanoma types, accounting for about three-quarters of nonmelanoma skin cancers.<Reference refidx="1"/>  The incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer appears to be increasing in some,<Reference refidx="2"/> but not all <Reference refidx="3"/> areas of the United States.  Overall U.S. incidence rates have likely been increasing for a number of years.<Reference refidx="4"/>  At least some of this increase may be attributable to increasing skin cancer awareness and resulting increasing investigation and biopsy of skin lesions.   </Para><Para id="_408">Precise estimation of the total numbers and incidence rate of nonmelanoma skin cancer is not possible because reporting to cancer registries is not required.  However, based on Medicare fee-for-service data, which were then extrapolated to the U.S. population, an estimated 2,152,500 persons were treated for nonmelanoma skin cancers in 2006.<Reference refidx="4"/>  That number would exceed all other cases of cancer estimated by the American Cancer Society for that year, which was about 1.4 million.<Reference refidx="5"/>  Although the two types of nonmelanoma skin cancer are the most common of all malignancies, they account for less than 0.1% of patient deaths caused by cancer.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_409"><Title>Risk Factors</Title><Para id="_410">Epidemiologic evidence suggests that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the sensitivity of an individual’s skin to UV radiation are risk factors for skin cancer, though the type of exposure (i.e., high-intensity exposure and short-duration exposure vs. chronic exposure) and pattern of exposure (i.e., continuous pattern vs. intermittent pattern) may differ among the three main skin cancer types.<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/><Reference refidx="8"/>  All three types of skin cancer are more likely to occur in individuals of light complexion who have had substantial exposure to sunlight, and skin cancers are more common in the southern latitudes of the Northern hemisphere.   In addition, the immune system may play a role in pathogenesis of skin cancers.  </Para><Para id="_411">Organ transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive drugs are at an elevated risk of skin cancers, particularly SCC.  Arsenic exposure also increases the risk of cutaneous SCC.<Reference refidx="1"/>  Serologic evidence from a population-based case-control study has shown a possible association between infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV) genus beta-species 1 and SCC.<Reference refidx="9"/><Reference refidx="10"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_328"><Title>Related Summaries</Title><Para id="_329">Note:  Other  PDQ summaries containing information related to skin cancer include the following: </Para><ItemizedList id="_330" Style="bullet"><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000552637" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-genetics-pdq">Genetics of Skin Cancer</SummaryRef></ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062917" url="/types/skin/hp/melanoma-treatment-pdq">Melanoma Treatment</SummaryRef></ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062764" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-prevention-pdq">Skin Cancer Prevention</SummaryRef></ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062750" url="/types/skin/hp/skin-screening-pdq">Skin Cancer Screening</SummaryRef></ListItem><ListItem><SummaryRef href="CDR0000062872#_88" url="/types/childhood-cancers/hp/unusual-cancers-childhood-pdq">Unusual Cancers of Childhood</SummaryRef> (skin cancer in children)</ListItem></ItemizedList></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Reszko A, Aasi SZ, Wilson LD, et al.: Cancer of the skin.

They are usually diagnosed on the basis of routine histopathology obtained from a shave, punch, or fusiform excisional biopsy.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para><SummarySection id="_177"><Title>Basal Cell Carcinoma</Title><Para id="_178">BCC is at least three times more common than SCC in nonimmunocompromised patients. It usually occurs on sun-exposed areas of skin, and the nose is the most frequent site. Although there are many different clinical presentations for BCC, the most characteristic type is the asymptomatic nodular or nodular ulcerative lesion that is elevated from the surrounding skin, has a pearly quality, and contains telangiectatic vessels. </Para><Para id="_346">BCC has a tendency to be locally destructive. High-risk areas for tumor recurrence after initial treatment include the central face (e.g., periorbital region, eyelids, nasolabial fold, or nose-cheek angle), postauricular region, pinna, ear canal, forehead, and scalp.<Reference refidx="3"/> A specific subtype of BCC is the morpheaform type. This subtype typically appears as a scar-like, firm plaque. Because of indistinct clinical tumor margins, the morpheaform type is difficult to treat adequately with traditional treatments.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_219">BCCs are composed of nonkeratinizing cells derived from the basal cell layer of the epidermis.  They are slow growing and rarely metastasize.  However, they can result in serious deforming damage locally if left untreated or if local recurrences cannot be completely excised.  BCCs often have a characteristic mutation in the patched 1 tumor suppressor gene (<GeneName>PTCH1</GeneName>), although the mechanism of carcinogenesis is not clear.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_179"><Title>Squamous Cell Carcinoma</Title><Para id="_180">SCCs also tend to occur on sun-exposed portions of the skin, such as the ears, lower lip, and dorsa of the hands. However, SCCs that arise in areas of non–sun-exposed skin or that originate de novo on areas of sun-exposed skin are prognostically worse because they have a greater tendency to metastasize than those that occur on sun-exposed skin that develop from actinic keratosis. People with chronic sun damage, sites of prior burns, arsenic exposure, chronic cutaneous inflammation as seen in longstanding skin ulcers, and sites of previous x-ray therapy are predisposed to the development of SCC.<Reference refidx="4"/></Para><Para id="_181">SCCs are composed of keratinizing cells.  These tumors are more aggressive than BCCs and have a range of growth, invasive, and metastatic potential.  Prognosis is associated with the degree of differentiation, and tumor grade is reported as part of the staging system.<Reference refidx="2"/>  A four-grade system (G1–G4) is most common, but two- and three-grade systems may also be used.  Mutations in the <GeneName>PTCH1</GeneName> tumor suppressor gene have been reported in SCCs  removed from patients with a prior history of multiple BCCs.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_182">SCC <Emphasis>in situ</Emphasis> (also called Bowen disease) is a noninvasive lesion.  It may be difficult to distinguish it pathologically from a benign inflammatory process.<Reference refidx="1"/>   The risk of development into invasive SCC is low, reportedly in the 3% to 4% range.<Reference refidx="6"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_183"><Title>Actinic Keratosis</Title><Para id="_184">Actinic keratoses are potential precursors of SCC, but the rate of progression is extremely low, and the vast majority do not become SCCs. These typically red, scaly patches usually arise on areas of chronically sun-exposed skin and are likely to be found on the face and dorsal aspects of the hand. </Para></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1">Reszko A, Aasi SZ, Wilson LD, et al.: Cancer of the skin.

usually not necessary. Regional lymph nodes should be routinely examined in
all cases of SCC, especially for high-risk tumors appearing
on the lips, ears, perianal and perigenital regions, or high-risk areas of the
hand.  In addition, regional lymph nodes should be examined with particular care in cases of
SCCs arising in sites of chronic ulceration or inflammation,
burn scars, or sites of previous radiation therapy treatment.

Even with relatively small tumor size, SCCs that occur in immunosuppressed patients tend to have more aggressive behavior than SCCs in nonimmunosuppressed patients.

Mohs micrographic surgery is a form of tumor excision that involves progressive radial sectioning and real-time examination of the resection margins until adequate uninvolved margins have been achieved, avoiding wider margins than needed.  Each of these methods is useful in specific clinical situations. Depending on case selection, these methods have recurrence-free rates ranging from 85% to 95%.</Para><Para id="_226">A systematic review of 27 randomized controlled trials comparing various treatments for BCC has been published.<Reference refidx="1"/> Eighteen of the studies were published in full, and nine were published in abstract form only. Only 19 of the 27 trials were analyzed by intention-to-treat criteria.  Because the case fatality rate of BCC is so low, the primary endpoint of most trials is complete response and/or recurrence rate after treatment.  Most of the identified studies had short follow-up times (only one study had a follow-up as long as 4 years) and were not of high quality.  Short follow-up periods will lead to overestimates of tumor control.
