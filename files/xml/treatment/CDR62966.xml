			 </KeyPoint><Para id="_143"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044971">Radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef> is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045944">x-rays</GlossaryTermRef> or other types of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045072">radiation</GlossaryTermRef> to kill cancer <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046476">cells</GlossaryTermRef> or keep them from growing.  There are two types of radiation therapy.  <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046686">External radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef> uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046345">Internal radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef> uses a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046550">radioactive</GlossaryTermRef> substance sealed in needles, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000257219">seeds</GlossaryTermRef>, wires, or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045637">catheters</GlossaryTermRef> that are placed directly into or near the cancer.

			 gland works. The doctor may test the thyroid gland before and after

It is also important that a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000389460">dentist</GlossaryTermRef> check the patient’s teeth, <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000481753">gums</GlossaryTermRef>, and mouth, and fix any existing problems before radiation therapy begins.</Para><Para id="_217"><GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000335073"> Intensity-modulated radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef> (IMRT) is a  type of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045582">3-dimensional</GlossaryTermRef> radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of  the size and shape of the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumor</GlossaryTermRef>. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles. This type of radiation therapy causes less damage to healthy <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046683">tissue</GlossaryTermRef> near the tumor. Compared to standard radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy may be less likely to cause <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044537">xerostomia</GlossaryTermRef> (dry mouth).

The total <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044664">dose</GlossaryTermRef> of radiation is divided into several smaller doses given over several days.

When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044678">injected</GlossaryTermRef> into a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000476471">vein</GlossaryTermRef> or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (<GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000301626">systemic chemotherapy</GlossaryTermRef>).

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
