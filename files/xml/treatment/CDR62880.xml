neoplasms: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.  The epidemiology of
these types varies markedly.  In the 1960s, squamous cell carcinomas comprised
over 90% of all esophageal tumors.  The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinomas
has risen markedly for the past 2 decades; it is now more prevalent
than squamous cell carcinomas in the United States and Western Europe, with most
tumors located in the distal esophagus.<Reference refidx="1"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_222"><Title>Incidence and Mortality</Title><Para id="_223">In 2015,  it is estimated that  16,980 Americans will be diagnosed with esophageal
cancer and  15,590 will die of this malignancy.  Of the new cases, it is estimated that  13,570 will
occur in men and  3,410  will occur in women.<Reference refidx="2"/> Incidence rates generally increase with age in all racial/ethnic groups.  In
black men, however, the incidence rate for those aged 55 to 69 years
is close to that of whites aged 70 years and older.  In black women, aged
55 to 69 years, the incidence rate is slightly higher than that of white women
aged 70 years and older.<Reference refidx="3"/></Para><Para id="_224">Although the overall incidence of
squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is declining, this histologic type
remains six times more likely to occur in black males than in white males.<Reference refidx="4"/> In contrast, the incidence of  adenocarcinoma of the esophagus rapidly increased from the 1970s to the mid-1990s.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para><Para id="_225">Male gender is an important predictor of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. The attributable risk is low enough in women that, although the risk from gender is not modifiable, other risk factors necessarily have limited impact.<Reference refidx="5"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_226"><Title>Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Esophagus</Title><SummarySection id="_227"><Title>Factors with adequate evidence of increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus</Title><SummarySection id="_228"><Title>Smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol</Title><Para id="_229">In the United States, squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is strongly associated with tobacco and alcohol abuse. The relative risk associated with tobacco use is 2.4, and the population attributable risk is 54.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0–76.2).<Reference refidx="6"/><Reference refidx="7"/> Retrospective cohort studies adjusted for tobacco use have shown a twofold to sevenfold increase in risk of esophageal cancer in alcoholics compared with rates for the general population.<Reference refidx="6"/> Case-control studies have also suggested a significantly increased risk of cancer of the esophagus associated with alcohol abuse.</Para><Para id="_230">In a multicenter, population-based, case-control study of 221 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and 695 controls, ever-smoking, alcohol consumption, and low fruit and vegetable consumption accounted for 56.9% (95% CI, 36.6%–75.1%), 72.4% (95% CI, 53.3%–85.8%), and 28.7% (95% CI, 11.1%–56.5%) of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, respectively, with a combined population attributable risk of 89.4% (95% CI, 79.1%–95.0%).<Reference refidx="8"/></Para><Para id="_231">In China, where the overall prevalence of esophageal carcinoma is much higher than in the United States, esophageal cancer is associated with deficiencies of nutrients, such as retinol, riboflavin, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, alpha-tocopherol, ascorbate and zinc, and with exposure to specific carcinogens (e.g., N-nitroso compounds).<Reference refidx="6"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_232"><Title>Factors with adequate evidence of decreased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus</Title><SummarySection id="_233"><Title>Chemoprevention</Title><Para id="_234">A prospective, placebo-controlled, esophagus chemoprevention study randomly assigned
610 high-risk Chinese patients.<Reference refidx="9"/>  Patients were aged 35 to 64 years
and received either placebo or combined low-dose retinol (15 mg or 50,000 IU)
plus riboflavin (200 mg) and zinc gluconate (50 mg) for 13.5 months.  Standard
histological evaluations (including two endoscopic biopsies) were conducted for 93% of
all entered patients.  Micronuclei from esophageal cells were obtained before
therapy began and after the 13.5 months of treatment.  Serum levels of vitamin
A, beta-carotene, riboflavin, and zinc were obtained at 0, 2, and 13.5 months.</Para><Para id="_235">The second report of this study presented micronuclei frequency results.<Reference refidx="10"/>  A
statistically significant reduction in the mean percentage of
micronucleated esophageal cells occurred in the active-treatment group compared with the
placebo group.  The pattern of cell proliferation, another potential
intermediate endpoint marker, also improved.<Reference refidx="11"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_236"><Title>Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use</Title><Para id="_237">A systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between aspirin and NSAID  use and esophageal cancer identified two cohort and seven case-control studies published between 1980 and 2001.<Reference refidx="12"/> Pooled results showed a protective association between aspirin/NSAID use and esophageal cancer (odds ratio [OR],  0.57; 95% CI,  0.47–0.71). The association with aspirin use was statistically significant (OR,  0.50; 95% CI,  0.38–0.66); the association with NSAIDs was borderline significant (OR, 0.75; 95% CI,  0.54–1.0). Aspirin/NSAID use was associated with lower risk of both adenocarcinoma (OR, 0.67; 95% CI,  0.51–0.87) and squamous cell carcinoma (OR,  0.58; 95% CI,  0.43–0.78).<Reference refidx="12"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_238"><Title>Adenocarcinoma of the Esophagus</Title><SummarySection id="_239"><Title>Factors associated with increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus</Title><SummarySection id="_241"><Title>Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)</Title><Para id="_242">The most important epidemiological difference between
squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma is the strong association
between GERD and adenocarcinoma.  The results
of a population-based case-controlled study suggest that symptomatic
gastroesophageal reflux is a risk factor for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.  The
frequency, severity, and duration of reflux symptoms were positively associated
with increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.<Reference refidx="13"/> In a case-control  study from Sweden, the OR was 7.7 for patients with recurrent reflux symptoms,  while the OR for patients with long-standing and severe symptoms was 43.5 (95% CI, 18.3–103.5).<Reference refidx="13"/> The probable mechanism is that long-standing GERD is associated with the development of Barrett esophagus, a condition in which an abnormal intestinal-type epithelium replaces the stratified squamous epithelium that normally lines the distal esophagus; Barrett esophagus is considered a precursor of esophageal adenocarcinoma.<Reference refidx="14"/> The intestinal-type epithelium of Barrett
esophagus has a characteristic endoscopic appearance that differs from squamous
epithelium.<Reference refidx="15"/>  Dysplasia in Barrett epithelium represents a neoplastic
alteration of the columnar epithelium that may progress to invasive
adenocarcinoma.<Reference refidx="16"/> </Para><Para id="_243">A population-based cohort study in Sweden shows that patients with Barrett esophagus develop adenocarcinoma of the esophagus at about 1.2 cases per 1,000 person-years of follow-up monitoring, which is about 11.3 times higher than in the general population.  Thus, while the relative risk may be elevated, the absolute risk is still not high.  Furthermore, over half of the cases of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus are not associated with GERD symptoms.</Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_244"><Title><ScientificName>Helicobacter Pylori</ScientificName></Title><Para id="_245">An interesting hypothesis associates the rise in the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus to a declining prevalence of <ScientificName>H. pylori</ScientificName> infection in
Western countries.  Reports have suggested that gastric infection with <ScientificName>H.
pylori</ScientificName> may protect the esophagus from GERD and its complications.<Reference refidx="17"/>  According
to this theory, <ScientificName>H. pylori</ScientificName> infections that cause pangastritis also cause a
decrease in gastric acid production that protects against GERD.<Reference refidx="18"/>  Patients
whose duodenal ulcers were treated successfully with antibiotics developed
reflux esophagitis twice as often as patients whose infections persisted.<Reference refidx="19"/> 
Other suggested factors to explain the increased risk of
adenocarcinoma of the esophagus include obesity <Reference refidx="20"/> and the use of medications such as
anticholinergics that can predispose to GERD by relaxing the lower esophageal
sphincter.<Reference refidx="21"/></Para></SummarySection></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_246"><Title>Interventions with adequate evidence of decreased risk of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus</Title><SummarySection id="_247"><Title>Aspirin and NSAID use</Title><Para id="_248">A  systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between aspirin and NSAID use and esophageal cancer identified two cohort and seven case-control studies published between 1980 and 2001.<Reference refidx="12"/> Pooled results show a protective association between aspirin/NSAID use and esophageal cancer (OR,  0.57; 95% CI,  0.47–0.71).

Among patients with low-grade dysplasia, eradication of dysplasia occurred in 90.5% of the treatment group compared with 22.7% in the control group;  in the high-grade dysplasia group, rates were 81.0% in the treatment group compared with 19.0% in the control group.  Additionally, 77.4% of patients in the ablation group had complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia, compared with 2.3% in the control group.  Patients in the ablation group had less disease progression, and although cancer was not  a primary outcome because expected numbers were small, there were fewer cancers in the ablation group (1.2% vs. 9.3%; <Emphasis>P</Emphasis> = .045).  The complication rate was relatively low; among 84 treated patients, there was one upper gastrointestinal  hemorrhage and five strictures that were easily treated.<Reference refidx="22"/></Para><Para id="_251">This study suggests that the treatment of patients with Barrett esophagus and dysplasia may ablate Barrett esophagus and prevent disease progression, but the study provides only weak evidence about whether treatment reduces the outcome of esophageal cancer (because it was not designed to answer that question).  Evidence from the study suggests that ablation does not simply coagulate and hide dangerous cells under the surface of the esophagus (those cells could later evolve to cancer).  A question entirely separate from this study is whether patients should be screened for Barrett esophagus (this study focused on treatment of patients with Barrett who had been identified as having dysplasia). Furthermore, the study does not discuss    the net benefits and harms of an overall program of screening (e.g.,  of screening patients with GERD or certain GERD symptoms) and the surveillance of patients with Barrett esophagus.       The potential for overdiagnosis and overtreatment may be considerable  if physicians used results of this study to treat patients with Barrett esophagus and no dysplasia.</Para></SummarySection></SummarySection></SummarySection><ReferenceSection><Citation idx="1" PMID="17185192">Holmes RS, Vaughan TL: Epidemiology and pathogenesis of esophageal cancer.
