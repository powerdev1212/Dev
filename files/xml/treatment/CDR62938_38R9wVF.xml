of all uterine malignancies.<Reference refidx="1"/>  The following  tumors arise primarily from three distinct
tissues: </Para><OrderedList id="_83" Style="Arabic"><ListItem>Carcinosarcomas arising in the endometrium,  in other organs of mullerian origin, and accounting for 40% to 50% of all uterine sarcomas.</ListItem><ListItem>Leiomyosarcomas arising from myometrial muscle, with a peak incidence occurring at age 50, and accounting for 30% of all uterine sarcomas.</ListItem><ListItem>Sarcomas arising in the endometrial stroma, with a peak incidence occurring before menopause for the low-grade tumors and after menopause for the high-grade tumors, and accounting for 15% of all uterine sarcomas.</ListItem></OrderedList><Para id="_84">The three distinct entities are often grouped under uterine sarcomas; however, each type of tumor is currently being studied in separate clinical trials.</Para><Para id="_85">Carcinosarcomas (the preferred designation by the World Health Organization [WHO]) are also referred to as mixed mesodermal sarcomas or mullerian tumors.

Carcinosarcomas parallel endometrial cancer in its postmenopausal predominance and in other of its epidemiologic features; increasingly, the treatment of carcinosarcomas is becoming similar to combined modality approaches for endometrial adenocarcinomas.</Para><Para id="_142">Other rare forms of uterine sarcomas also fall under the WHO classification of mesenchymal and mixed tumors of the uterus.

etiologic factor in 10% to 25% of these malignancies is prior pelvic radiation therapy,
which is often administered for benign uterine bleeding that began 5 to 25 years earlier.
An increased incidence of uterine sarcoma has been associated with tamoxifen in the treatment of breast cancer. Subsequently, increases have also been noted when tamoxifen  was given to prevent breast cancer in women at increased risk—a possible result of the estrogenic effect of tamoxifen on the uterus. Because of this increase, patients on tamoxifen should have follow-up pelvic examinations and should undergo endometrial biopsy if there is any abnormal uterine bleeding.<Reference refidx="4"/><Reference refidx="5"/><Reference refidx="6"/></Para></SummarySection><SummarySection id="_89"><Title>Prognosis</Title><Para id="_144">The prognosis for women with uterine sarcoma is primarily dependent on the extent of
disease at the time of diagnosis.<Reference refidx="7"/>  For women with carcinosarcomas, significant
predictors of metastatic disease at initial surgery include:<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_145" Style="bullet"><ListItem> Isthmic or cervical location.</ListItem><ListItem>Lymphatic vascular space invasion.</ListItem><ListItem>Serous and clear cell histology.</ListItem><ListItem>Grade 2 or 3 carcinoma.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_150">The above factors in addition to the following ones correlate with a progression-free interval:<Reference refidx="7"/></Para><ItemizedList id="_151" Style="bullet">

     <ListItem>The presence or absence of stromal heterologous elements.</ListItem><ListItem>The
types of such elements.</ListItem><ListItem>The grade of the stromal components.</ListItem><ListItem>The mitotic
activity of the stromal components.</ListItem></ItemizedList><Para id="_3">    In one study, women
with a well-differentiated sarcomatous component or carcinosarcomas had
significantly longer progression-free intervals than those with moderately to
poorly differentiated sarcomas for the homologous and heterologous types. 
The recurrence rate was 44% for homologous tumors and 63% for heterologous
tumors.  The type of heterologous sarcoma had no effect on the progression-free
interval.  </Para><Para id="_90">For women with leiomyosarcomas, some investigators consider tumor size to be the most
important prognostic factor; women with tumors greater than 5.0 cm in maximum
diameter have a poor prognosis.<Reference refidx="8"/>  However, in a Gynecologic Oncology Group
study, the mitotic index was the only factor significantly related to
progression-free interval.<Reference refidx="7"/>  Leiomyosarcomas matched for other known
prognostic factors may be more aggressive than their carcinosarcoma 
counterparts.<Reference refidx="9"/>  The 5-year survival rate for women with stage I disease, which is 
confined to the corpus, is approximately 50% versus 0% to 20% for the remaining
stages.
</Para></SummarySection><Para id="_4">Surgery alone can be curative if the malignancy is contained within the uterus. 
The value of pelvic radiation therapy is not established.  Current studies consist
primarily of phase II chemotherapy trials for patients with advanced disease.  Adjuvant
chemotherapy following complete resection  for patients with stage I or II disease was not established to be effective in a randomized trial.<Reference refidx="10"/>  Yet, other nonrandomized
trials have reported improved survival following adjuvant chemotherapy with or
without radiation therapy.<Reference refidx="11"/><Reference refidx="12"/><Reference refidx="13"/>

If the diagnosis is known, the extent of surgery is planned according to the stage of the tumor.  Hysterectomy is usually performed when a uterine malignancy is suspected, except for rare instances when preservation of the uterus in a young patient is deemed safe for the type of cancer (e.g., a totally confined low-grade leiomyosarcoma in a woman who desires to retain childbearing potential).  Medically suitable patients with the preoperative diagnosis of uterine sarcoma
are considered candidates for abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic and periaortic selective lymphadenectomy. 
Cytologic washings are obtained from the pelvis and abdomen.  Thorough
examination of the diaphragm, omentum, and upper abdomen is performed.

or radiation therapy is of benefit for patients with uterine sarcoma.<Reference refidx="1"/> 
In one Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) study, the use of adjuvant doxorubicin did not alter the survival rate of patients with resected stage I or stage II uterine sarcomas; however, interpretation of these results is difficult because this study included some patients who received radiation and three types of uterine sarcomas that have variable responses to doxorubicin.<Reference refidx="1"/>[<LOERef href="CDR0000335125">Level of evidence: 1iiA</LOERef>] However, because the risk of disease recurrence is high even with localized
