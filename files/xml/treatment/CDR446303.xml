This summary refers to the trademarked (brand name) mixtures only. </Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_24"><Question>What is the history of the discovery and use of Essiac and Flor Essence as complementary or alternative treatments for cancer?</Question><Answer><Para id="_42"> A <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000269445">nurse</GlossaryTermRef> in Canada first began to promote Essiac as a cancer treatment in the 1920s. Today, Essiac and Flor Essence may be sold as herbal supplements as long as they do not claim to treat or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000318813">cure</GlossaryTermRef> cancer. </Para><ItemizedList id="_41" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem> In 1922, a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000444971">breast cancer</GlossaryTermRef> patient gave the Essiac formula to the nurse and said it had cured her disease. The patient said the formula came from an Ontario Ojibwa Native American medicine man. 

</ListItem><ListItem>In 1934, the nurse opened a cancer clinic in Ontario and gave Essiac to patients free of charge. 

In 1938, the Royal Cancer Commission of Canada visited the clinic but found little evidence that Essiac was effective. The nurse closed the clinic in 1942 but continued to give Essiac to patients until the late 1970s.

</ListItem><ListItem>Between 1959 and the late 1970s, the nurse worked with an American doctor to study Essiac in the laboratory and in people and to promote its use. They also created the formula now called Flor Essence. The results of their studies were not reported in any <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000537399">peer-reviewed scientific journals</GlossaryTermRef>. Most <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044724">scientific</GlossaryTermRef> journals have experts who review research reports before they are published, to make sure that the evidence and conclusions are sound. This is called peer review. Studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals are considered to be better evidence.</ListItem><ListItem> 

In 1977, the nurse gave the formula for Essiac to a company in Canada. 

In 1978, the government of Canada allowed this company to do <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044195">clinical studies</GlossaryTermRef> (research studies with people) on the safety and effectiveness of Essiac.

In 1982, it withdrew its permission (see <SummaryRef href="CDR0000446303#_27" url="/about-cancer/treatment/cam/patient/essiac-pdq">Question 6</SummaryRef>). This company tried to have Essiac approved as a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000348921">drug</GlossaryTermRef> by the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454785">US Food and Drug Administration</GlossaryTermRef> (FDA), but did not get approval.

</ListItem><ListItem>In the 1980s, companies making Essiac-like products began to sell the mixtures as health tonics. Because these companies did not make claims that it would treat or cure certain diseases, Essiac did not come under laws that  regulate it as a drug.
</ListItem></ItemizedList></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_30"><Question>What is the theory behind the claim that Essiac and Flor Essence are useful in treating cancer?</Question><Answer><Para id="_13">Supporters of Essiac and Flor Essence say that when the herbs they contain are mixed in exact amounts, the mixtures make the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046356">immune system</GlossaryTermRef> stronger, have <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044187">anti-inflammatory</GlossaryTermRef> effects (decrease swelling, redness, and pain), and show anticancer activity. Individual herbs in the Essiac and Flor Essence formulas have been shown to have these effects, but some of these herbs also have been shown to help cancer grow. Some supporters of Essiac recommend that <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044198">conventional therapy</GlossaryTermRef> (such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045214">chemotherapy</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044971">radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef>) not be used at the same time as Essiac because that may prevent Essiac from being effective. </Para><Para id="_45">There is no evidence reported in <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000537399">peer-reviewed scientific journals</GlossaryTermRef> to show that the exact formulas of Essiac and Flor Essence are effective in patients with cancer or other health conditions, or that conventional therapies interfere with the effects of Essiac.

According to the companies that make the teas, the proper <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044664">dose</GlossaryTermRef> of Essiac depends on why a person is taking it.     The maker recommends that Essiac be taken for 12 weeks in a row.  The maker of Flor Essence states that adults may take between 30 and 
360 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044214">milliliters</GlossaryTermRef> (1 to 12 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044669">fluid</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000330174">ounces</GlossaryTermRef>) of Flor Essence tea a day, depending on individual needs, and may take it on an ongoing basis.

</Para><Para id="_15">The makers of Essiac and Flor Essence state that the products can be used with other <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044737">therapies</GlossaryTermRef>.  Some supporters of Essiac, however, recommend that patients avoid any other anticancer therapy (such as <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045214">chemotherapy</GlossaryTermRef> or <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044971">radiation therapy</GlossaryTermRef>) when taking Essiac, because it may interfere with immune system function and prevent Essiac from working effectively.</Para></Answer></QandAEntry><QandAEntry id="_26"><Question>Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using Essiac or Flor Essence?</Question><Answer><Para id="_16">Research in a laboratory or using animals is done to find out if a <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000348921">drug</GlossaryTermRef>, procedure, or treatment is likely to be useful in humans.

These <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044517">preclinical studies</GlossaryTermRef> are done before any testing in humans is begun. 

The following <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044512">laboratory</GlossaryTermRef> and <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000454774">animal studies</GlossaryTermRef> of Essiac have been reported:</Para><ItemizedList id="_17" Style="bullet" Compact="No"><ListItem>In the mid 1970s, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in New York City tested dried and liquid samples of Essiac in 8 experiments involving the S–180 mouse <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045562">sarcoma</GlossaryTermRef> tumor model (a type of <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000043996">animal model</GlossaryTermRef> used to study treatment).  Researchers found that Essiac did not make the immune system more active and did not act as an anticancer drug.</ListItem><ListItem>In the early 1980s, researchers at MSKCC tested Essiac again.  They found no anticancer activity after doing 17 studies that used a variety of animal <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000045343">leukemia</GlossaryTermRef> models and other tumor models.  </ListItem><ListItem>In 1983, the <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044266">National Cancer Institute</GlossaryTermRef> (NCI) tested a liquid sample of Essiac in the mouse P388 <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000330173">lymphocytic leukemia</GlossaryTermRef> <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000046634">tumor</GlossaryTermRef> system but found no anticancer activity.  Very high <GlossaryTermRef href="CDR0000044664">doses</GlossaryTermRef> of Essiac killed the test animals.

Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become "standard." Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.

  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_2"><Title>General CAM Information</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_3">Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also referred to as integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_4">Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_5">Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any therapeutic approach, because some complementary and alternative therapies may interfere with their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. </Para></SummarySection> 
  <SummarySection id="_AboutCAM_6"><Title>Evaluation of CAM Approaches</Title><Para id="_AboutCAM_7">It is important that the same rigorous scientific evaluation used to assess conventional approaches be used to evaluate CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute  and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to evaluate CAM therapies for cancer. </Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_8">Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a rigorous scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have undergone rigorous evaluation. A small number of CAM therapies originally considered to be purely alternative approaches are finding a place in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH)  in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to be effective in the management of chemotherapy-associated nausea and vomiting and in controlling pain associated with surgery. In contrast, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found ineffective or potentially harmful.</Para><Para id="_AboutCAM_9"><ExternalRef xref="http://cam.cancer.gov/cam/best_case_intro.html">The NCI Best Case Series Program</ExternalRef>   which was started  in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being investigated. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM.
